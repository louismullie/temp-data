## Question

What does it mean when you have a glossy tongue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when you have a glossy tongue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and what "glossy" implies histologically. Then, I should verify the most common causes, starting with atrophic glossitis and nutritional deficiencies. Next, I will consider systemic diseases and medications that can produce this appearance. After that, I need to check for mimics and less common etiologies. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and when to treat versus when to refer or biopsy, making sure I anchor each step to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a glossy tongue typically reflects loss of the normal filiform papillae, which makes the dorsal surface smooth, shiny, and often erythematous. Clinically, this is described as atrophic glossitis, and it can be diffuse or patchy depending on the underlying cause.

> Now, I should verify the most common etiologies, and nutritional deficiencies are front and center. Iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folate deficiency are classic causes of atrophic glossitis; the tongue becomes smooth, depapillated, and may burn or feel sore, and importantly, the glossitis can precede hematologic abnormalities, so I need to check B12 and iron even if the CBC is normal [^8f8ca474] [^596bccf9] [^cd040f19].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about deficiency being the only cause. I need to check for systemic diseases that can produce a glossy tongue. Celiac disease, Sjögren syndrome, and sarcoidosis are established associations with atrophic glossitis, and in Sjögren syndrome, tongue atrophy and fissuring can be particularly prominent and may even correlate with lymphoma risk in some patients, so I should keep that in mind during evaluation [^ae12e939] [^90763386].

> Next, I should review medication and iatrogenic contributors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and inhaled or topical corticosteroids can predispose to candidal overgrowth with depapillation and burning, producing an atrophic, glossy appearance; tetracyclines are specifically linked to glossitis and black hairy tongue, so medication reconciliation is essential before labeling a case as idiopathic [^2533bf42] [^44602b93].

> Wait, let me verify the role of infections. Candida albicans commonly colonizes atrophic mucosa and can worsen depapillation and pain; in fact, in a series of patients with partial atrophic tongue, Candida was isolated in most cases and antifungal therapy led to regeneration of papillae and symptom improvement, so I should have a low threshold to evaluate for candidiasis in a glossy, burning tongue [^17689ce3].

> I will now examine less common but important mimics and differentials. Geographic tongue can look depapillated in its erythematous patches, but the hallmark is a migrating, map-like pattern with white borders; fissured tongue has grooves rather than uniform smoothness; median rhomboid glossitis is a central, rhomboid depapillated patch often with candida; and burning mouth syndrome can present with a normal-appearing or mildly atrophic tongue, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating sensory syndromes with true papillary atrophy [^8f8ca474] [^576645c4] [^28e397c5].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach so I don't miss anything. I should confirm the history of onset, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, medications, and systemic symptoms. On exam, I should document the extent of depapillation, look for fissures, white plaques, angular cheilitis, and lymphadenopathy. And I should order targeted labs including CBC, iron studies, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, and consider celiac serology or ANA if clinical features suggest autoimmune disease. If candida is suspected, I should obtain cultures or direct microscopy and treat empirically when appropriate [^8f8ca474] [^596bccf9] [^17689ce3].

> But wait, what if the glossy tongue persists despite correcting deficiencies and treating candida? I should double-check for persistent systemic disease or consider biopsy if there are focal, nonhealing, or suspicious areas to exclude lichen planus, leukoplakia, or other potentially malignant disorders; the ADA guideline emphasizes biopsy as the criterion standard for persistent unexplained oral lesions, and I need to ensure I escalate evaluation accordingly [^add95a82] [^7315fd96].

> Next, I should review treatment principles and make sure they align with the cause. For nutritional deficiencies, replacement of iron, B12, or folate typically leads to papillary regeneration and resolution of glossitis over weeks to months. For candida-associated atrophy, antifungal therapy plus addressing predisposing factors is key. For autoimmune or inflammatory drivers, disease-specific management may be necessary. And for asymptomatic, benign variants like geographic tongue, reassurance and avoidance of irritants are usually sufficient [^8f8ca474] [^596bccf9] [^17689ce3].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: a glossy tongue most often signals atrophic glossitis from nutritional deficiencies, systemic diseases, medications, or candidal overgrowth, but I should systematically exclude mimics and persistent or suspicious lesions. With a focused history, exam, and labs, I can identify the cause in most patients and tailor therapy, reserving biopsy for nonresolving or atypical cases [^8f8ca474] [^596bccf9] [^add95a82].

A glossy tongue most often reflects **atrophic glossitis** [^8f8ca474] — a smooth, shiny surface due to loss of papillae — and is commonly linked to **nutritional deficiencies** (iron, vitamin B12, folate) [^596bccf9], **systemic diseases** (celiac, Sjögren's, sarcoidosis) [^ae12e939], or **medications** (antibiotics, corticosteroids) [^576645c4]. It can also result from **candidiasis** [^17689ce3], dehydration, or chronic irritation. Evaluation should include a focused history, oral exam, and labs (CBC, iron, B12, folate) [^596bccf9]; management targets the underlying cause, with nutritional repletion, antifungal therapy, or medication adjustment as indicated [^8f8ca474]. Persistent or atypical cases warrant biopsy to exclude malignancy [^add95a82].

---

## Clinical appearance and associated symptoms

A glossy tongue typically presents with the following features:

- **Smooth, shiny surface**: Loss of normal papillae, giving the tongue a smooth, reflective appearance [^8f8ca474].

- **Erythema**: The tongue may appear reddened due to inflammation or vascular prominence [^596bccf9].

- **Burning sensation**: Patients often report discomfort, burning, or sensitivity, particularly to hot or spicy foods [^17689ce3].

- **Altered taste**: Taste disturbances, including metallic or bitter tastes, are common [^88577a33].

- **Fissures or grooves**: Deep fissures may coexist, especially in fissured tongue [^28e397c5].

---

## Common causes of glossy tongue

Several factors contribute to the development of a glossy tongue, including:

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Iron deficiency anemia [^596bccf9] <br/> - Vitamin B12 deficiency [^cd040f19] <br/> - Folate deficiency [^8f8ca474] |
| Systemic diseases | - Celiac disease [^ae12e939] <br/> - Sjögren syndrome [^90763386] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^ae12e939] <br/> - Pernicious anemia [^576bcd3e] |
| Medications | - Antibiotics (e.g. tetracyclines) [^2533bf42] <br/> - Corticosteroids [^ae12e939] <br/> - Antipsychotics [^399071af] |
| Infections | - Candida albicans (oral thrush) [^17689ce3] <br/> - Herpes simplex virus (herpetic geometric glossitis) [^4f9c96ce] |
| Chronic irritation | - Tobacco use [^576645c4] <br/> - Alcohol consumption [^576645c4] <br/> - Poor oral hygiene [^399071af] |
| Dehydration | - Xerostomia (dry mouth) [^notfound] <br/> - Chronic mouth breathing |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential to identify the underlying cause of a glossy tongue:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history of dietary habits, medication use, systemic symptoms, and oral hygiene practices. Physical examination should include inspection of the tongue, oral mucosa, and lymph nodes [^596bccf9].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), iron studies, vitamin B12, folate levels, and thyroid function tests may be indicated based on clinical suspicion [^cd040f19].

- **Biopsy**: Persistent or atypical lesions may require biopsy to exclude malignancy or other serious conditions [^add95a82].

---

## Treatment and management

Treatment of a glossy tongue focuses on addressing the underlying cause:

- **Nutritional supplementation**: Iron, vitamin B12, or folate supplementation is indicated for deficiencies [^8f8ca474].

- **Medication adjustment**: Discontinuation or substitution of offending medications may be necessary [^notfound].

- **Antifungal therapy**: Topical or systemic antifungal agents are used for candidal infections [^17689ce3].

- **Oral hygiene measures**: Regular tongue brushing, hydration, and avoidance of irritants such as tobacco and alcohol are recommended [^399071af].

- **Management of systemic diseases**: Appropriate treatment of underlying systemic conditions, such as celiac disease or Sjögren syndrome, is essential [^ae12e939].

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, a glossy tongue may lead to:

- **Chronic discomfort**: Persistent burning sensation and taste disturbances [^notfound].

- **Increased risk of infections**: Chronic candidiasis or other secondary infections [^notfound].

- **Malignancy risk**: Although rare, chronic atrophic glossitis may increase the risk of oral cancer, particularly in the presence of other risk factors such as tobacco use or alcohol consumption [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical evaluation is recommended if the following occur:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Glossy tongue lasting more than two weeks without improvement [^notfound].

- **Severe discomfort**: Significant pain, burning, or difficulty eating or speaking [^notfound].

- **Associated symptoms**: Weight loss, fatigue, or other systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Risk factors**: History of tobacco or alcohol use, immunocompromised status, or chronic medication use [^576645c4].

---

A glossy tongue is a smooth, shiny surface due to papillary atrophy and most often reflects **atrophic glossitis** from nutritional deficiencies, systemic disease, or medications [^8f8ca474]. Evaluation should include history, exam, and targeted labs; management focuses on correcting the cause, with biopsy for persistent or atypical lesions [^add95a82].

### Glossitis and other tongue disorders [^7490194e]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Patients frequently present complaining of tongue abnormalities. Knowledge of normal tongue anaomy an d architecture enable the clinician t odifferentiate variations of normal from abnormal conditions. Many tongue conditions are benign and. require reassurance and explanation, with little to no treatment. Others can signify systemic disorders. Examination of the tongue is an integral part of a complete physical examination. Recognizing the disorders of the tongue that are benign and do not require treatment or further evaluation prevents unnecessary testing for the patient. Careful evaluation of the tongue may provide valuable clues to a systemic disorder.

### Classification of GLOSSECTOMIES: proposal for tongue cancer resections [^74a0ffae]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Starting from the cancer and from the muscles involved, we have developed a classification of glossectomies that clearly and immediately highlights what structures are involved and therefore which type of glossectomy is indicated for achieving a complete removal with minimal functional impact.

The aim of this article is to propose a terminology for tongue cancer surgery that is uniform and consistent.

We understand that any attempt at classification, especially in the field of tongue surgery, will inevitably be subject to a certain imprecision. A correct classification which not only takes into account all possible variables yet is also sufficiently simple to apply allows a standardized definition of each tongue resection. This is also very useful for education and training, sharing information, and comparing results.

This classification developed at the European Institute of Oncology, with long‐term experience in the surgical management of tongue cancer, was reviewed and endorsed by experts from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, United States of America, as well as the A. C. Camargo Cancer Center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is based on very precise anatomical and functional components, whose removal depends on the precise nature of the tumor and the surgical anatomy of the tongue; however, to be practical and accepted, it should include the agreement of other surgeons.

### Classification of GLOSSECTOMIES: proposal for tongue cancer resections [^7a7ff148]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Surgery of tongue tumors includes different procedures ranging from mucosal resection to complex combined resection. Numerous terms have been used to describe such procedures, but there is no consensus between the terminology and the extent of resection.

Methods and Results

We searched the medical literature and found a lack of published information. We undertook to describe a new classification of surgical procedures for tongue tumor resection. We based it upon the surgical anatomy of the tongue and the spread of the cancer. We posited that there were five major types of glossectomy embracing all the methods of tongue cancer resection. This classification was reviewed and endorsed by an international team of experts.

Conclusion

We propose a more precise classification than that currently in practice, thereby bringing clarity and consistency to the terminology, facilitating shared communication between surgeons, comparison between published research, and ultimately improving surgical practice and patient care.

### Common tongue conditions in primary care [^596bccf9]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although easily examined, abnormalities of the tongue can present a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for physicians. Recognition and diagnosis require a thorough history, including onset and duration, antecedent symptoms, and tobacco and alcohol use. Examination of tongue morphology and a careful assessment for lymphadenopathy are also important. Geographic tongue, fissured tongue, and hairy tongue are the most common tongue problems and do not require treatment. Median rhomboid glossitis is usually associated with a candidal infection and responds to topical antifungals. Atrophic glossitis is often linked to an underlying nutritional deficiency of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, riboflavin, or niacin and resolves with correction of the underlying condition. Oral hairy leukoplakia, which can be a marker for underlying immunodeficiency, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and is treated with oral antivirals. Tongue growths usually require biopsy to differentiate benign lesions (e.g., granular cell tumors, fibromas, lymphoepithelial cysts) from premalignant leukoplakia or squamous cell carcinoma. Burning mouth syndrome often involves the tongue and has responded to treatment with alpha-lipoic acid, clonazepam, and cognitive behavior therapy in controlled trials. Several trials have also confirmed the effectiveness of surgical division of tongue-tie (ankyloglossia), in the context of optimizing the success of breastfeeding compared with education alone. Tongue lesions of unclear etiology may require biopsy or referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, head and neck surgeon, or a dentist experienced in oral pathology.

### A review of the most promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of tongue squamous cell carcinoma [^323e5876]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Cancerous cells, or other body cells in response to tumor development secrete or release a subset of biomarkers into tissues and different biological body fluids. The body fluid biomarkers can be detected and evaluated in succession with non-invasive or slightly invasive means, whereas tissues-derived ones need invasive procedures like biopsies. For TSCC, finding a novel, and specific biomarker in body fluids can offer complementary information beyond what is provided by current clinical practice, especially in the field of early detection and diagnosis. Additionally, biomarkers that mirror genetic alterations and proteins expressions on histological slides may play a key role in predicting tongue cancer behavior and determining the treatment plans.

There is a three-level evidence hierarchy for biomarker validation, ranging from exploratory to validated to clinically useful, and to qualify as a useful biomarker it is essential to successfully pass them all. The exploratory biomarker is defined as any biomolecule identified in one discovery publication with targeted or untargeted approaches. This classification results in a large list of discovery biomarkers that, however, require rigorous validation. Validation is a second and pivotal step to move any biomarker towards clinical implementation, and is based primarily on confirming a discovery biomarker's finding in at least two independent studies. To date, despite the proposition of a large number of potential biomarkers of TSCC, none are currently used in clinical practice, and only very few have actually proceeded towards the path of validation.

To our knowledge, this review is the first to list the published literature on both liquid and tissue-based biomarkers in TSCC. Since squamous cell carcinoma of different subsites of the oral cavity is quite heterogeneous, we only considered studies that specifically addressed the tongue locus and in particular the mobile part of the tongue. Our focus was particularly on biomarkers whose clinical significance was described in at least two independent studies. As these might represent promising biomarker candidates, we evaluated the studies with regard to the potential of these biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of TSCC, in which the markers demonstrated a consistent association between their expression and specific clinical outcomes. Moreover, we evaluated them using Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK)guidelines for prognostic studies and STARD(Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) criteria for the diagnostic ones. In this way, we aim to help both researchers and clinicians in identifying and pursuing the most promising tongue cancer biomarkers for further evaluation and validation studies.

### Benign migratory glossitis or geographic tongue: an enigmatic oral lesion [^9dc45bc2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Benign migratory glossitis, or geographic tongue, is usually an asymptomatic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that affects the epithelium of the tongue. Local loss of filiform papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that rapidly change the color and size. Histopathologic findings parallel the clinical appearance, and may have a psoriasiform pattern. The disorder is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. In most cases, patients do not require treatment other than reassurance about the benign nature of the disorder.

### Classification of GLOSSECTOMIES: proposal for tongue cancer resections [^47e53a07]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering the current wide acceptance of "compartmental" surgery for tongue cancer, 18 it seemed timely to propose this classification for defining each procedure employed for the removal of tumors of the tongue.

The purpose of this work is not to enter into the merits of the indications of the neck dissection. Nor does it aim to explore the details of the reconstructive techniques used to repair the surgical defect. We limit ourselves to underline that, in general, type I glossectomy should not require prophylactic neck dissection. In type II glossectomy, supraomohyoid neck dissection should be carried out based on the probability of occult metastases and according to the institutional and international guidelines. From the type III glossectomy onward, the dissection of the neck should be done as an en bloc procedure. In the type IV and V glossectomies, the en bloc resection should be performed with bilateral neck dissection. In brief, the extent of tongue resection — type of glossectomy — is a reflection of the three‐dimensional extent of the primary tumor, and thus would entail the need for elective neck dissection based on the rising risk of occult metastases in the clinically negative neck.

The objective of this classification is to provide precise anatomical coordinates which will enable the techniques to be uniformly standardized, thereby rendering them repeatable and comparable. This will also provide the pathologist with detailed anatomical information. We believe that this kind of classification could help us even in the planning of the reconstructive time (the choice of the flap will be easier if, for example, one can readily predict a type IIIb, IV, or V glossectomies).

### The prevalence and significance of fissured tongue and geographical tongue in psoriatic patients [^67360678]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tongue lesions are not uncommon in psoriasis, but their significance is not clear. Aims. To determine the prevalence of tongue lesions in patients with psoriasis and to detect possible associations.

Methods

All consecutive patients with psoriasis seen in a dermatology clinic in northern Iran between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled in a prospective study. A questionnaire detailing the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease was completed for each patient, and all patients were examined for tongue lesions.

Results

In total, 306 patients with psoriasis were enrolled in the study (170 women, 136 men; female: male ratio 1.25: 1; mean age 29.7 years; mean age at onset of psoriasis 23.3 years). Overall, 47 patients (15.4%) had tongue lesions; 25 (8.2%) had fissured tongue, 17 (5.6%) had geographical tongue (benign migratory glossitis) and 5 (1.6%) patients had both fissured and geographical tongue. Geographical tongue was seen in 7.2% of patients with early onset psoriasis and only in 1.3% of patients with late-onset psoriasis. Overall, patients with tongue lesions were found to have more nail and genital involvement.

Conclusion

It appears that geographical tongue, but not fissured tongue, is more common in early onset psoriasis and may be an indicator of disease severity.

### Common tongue conditions in primary care [^8f8ca474]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Tongue conditions occur in 15.5% of the US population. The most common tongue conditions are geographic tongue, fissured tongue, and black hairy tongue; these conditions do not require treatment. Median rhomboid glossitis can be associated with a candidal infection; symptomatic lesions usually improve with use of antifungals. Atrophic glossitis is often linked to a nutritional deficiency and resolves with treatment of the underlying condition. Oral hairy leukoplakia is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often presents in patients with severely compromised immunity; it can be treated with oral antivirals. Growths of the tongue usually require biopsy to differentiate benign lesions (eg, traumatic fibromas, squamous cell papillomas) from leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, otolaryngologist, or a dentist experienced in oral pathology may be indicated. Burning mouth syndrome often involves the tongue, and if it does not resolve spontaneously, studies have shown improvement with gabapentin, topical clonazepam, capsaicin, and cognitive behavior therapy. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the tongue and is best treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. There is a lack of consensus on the definition and treatment of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie); however, some evidence supports that frenotomy can improve breastfeeding and decrease lactation-associated nipple pain.

### Burning red tongue with grooves [^28e397c5]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of a burning red tongue. The patient had no significant medical history and was on no medications. He did not smoke or drink alcohol and followed a normal diet. Examination found an erythematous tongue with deep grooves running along the dorsum of the tongue in a symmetrical pattern associated with a lack of papillae (Fig 1). There were no ulcers or white patches, and there was no angular cheilitis. Laboratory results showed no signs of anemia, normal iron studies, and vitamin B12 and were negative for HIV.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Geographic tongue
B. Strawberry tongue
C. Fissured tongue
D. Geometric glossitis
E. Median rhomboid glossitis

Answers:
A. Geographic tongue – Incorrect. Geographic tongue, or benign migratory glossitis, is characterized by patches of papillary atrophy surrounded by raised white borders. These patches change in shape and size and move across the surface of the tongue over time.
B. Strawberry tongue – Incorrect. Strawberry tongue presents with enlarged lingual papillae, not a lack of papillae. Strawberry tongue has a white coating, whereas red strawberry tongue has a dark red surface.
C. Fissured tongue – Correct. Fissured (also known as scrotal) tongue presents with deep grooves on the dorsum of the tongue that are usually painless, although some patients do report a burning sensation. This patient also has idiopathic atrophic glossitis, which results in the tongue having a smooth and glossy appearance.
D. Geometric glossitis – Incorrect. Also known as herpetic geometric glossitis, the tongue will present with linear fissures on the dorsal tongue, especially with a fissure down the center. However, the lesions are very tender and painful and are associated with immunocompromised patients with HSV-1.
E. Median rhomboid glossitis – Incorrect. Only a rhomboidal portion of the central dorsal tongue is depapillated in median rhomboid glossitis, as opposed to total depapillation. It is commonly associated with oral candidiasis.

### Classification of GLOSSECTOMIES: proposal for tongue cancer resections [^57bc8a42]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSION

Based on our own experience and the published literature regarding the various types of glossectomy employed in tongue cancer surgery, we wish to propose a more precise and informative classification than what is currently in practice. It is based upon the surgical anatomy of the tongue which comprises also the routes of spread of the tongue cancer. Our proposal is to classify the surgical procedures for tongue cancer into five types, on the basis of well‐defined structures to be excised. The terminology describing each type of glossectomy must also indicate the surgical access employed.

### Diseases of the tongue [^da7ea9bd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The tongue is a complex organ involved in speech and expression as well as in gustation, mastication, and deglutition. The oral cavity, along with the tongue, are sites of neoplasms, reactive processes, and infections, and may be a harbinger of systemic diseases. This review includes both common and rare diseases that occur on the tongue, including: vascular and lymphatic lesions (infantile hemangiomas and oral varices), reactive and inflammatory processes (hairy tongue, pigmented fungiform papillae of the tongue, benign migratory glossitis, and fissured tongue), infections (oral hairy leukoplakia, herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections, human papillomavirus, and candidiasis), premalignant lesions (leukoplakia and erythroplakia), malignant lesions (squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and lymphoproliferative diseases), and signs of systemic disease (nutritional deficiency and systemic amyloidosis).

### Classification of GLOSSECTOMIES: proposal for tongue cancer resections [^816c74a9]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The term "glossectomy" is used to describe a variety of surgical procedures for the resection of tongue tumors. In 1978, Péri described four types of transoral glossectomy for noncancer‐related diseases of the tongue to reduce tongue volume. 1 Later on, other attempts were made to classify macroglossia‐related surgery 2 and tongue cancer‐related surgery. 3

However, as yet, no classification exists for defining the extent of tongue resection for tumor removal. A literature search conducted on PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) using the terms "glossectomy" and "tongue cancer" yielded over 700 English‐language papers on surgery of the tongue for malignant neoplasms in the human. A thorough examination of the terminology used to define surgical removal of tongue cancers identified the following expressions: glossectomy, partial glossectomy, hemiglossectomy, subtotal glossectomy, transoral glossectomy, total glossectomy, cuneiform glossectomy, and compartmental glossectomy.

For the vast majority of these publications, there is no correlation between the term describing the surgical procedure and the extent of the resection carried out: for example, when the terms "subtotal glossectomy" or "hemiglossectomy" are used it is never specified what part of the tongue was removed and what was saved. The lack of a clear anatomical and functional definition of the various glossectomies reported in the literature leads to much confusion and misunderstanding. Such a degree of vagueness in the definition of tongue surgery makes it somewhat difficult to teach and train surgeons, and more difficult still to compare the experiences of different surgeons.

The tongue can be considered as a median organ made up of two equal parts, separated from each other by the median raphe. Each half has its own extrinsic muscles (hyoglossus, styloglossus, genioglossus, and palatoglossus) and intrinsic muscles (longitudinal and transverse), venous and arterial vessels, and its distinct motor and sensory nerves (Figure 1).

2 TYPE I GLOSSECTOMY (MUCOSECTOMY)

Definition: Incision of the mucosa in healthy tissue with appropriate safety margins (1.0‐0.5 cm depending on whether or not the lesion is well defined). The mucosa and submucosa are included up to the intrinsic muscle fibers of the tongue. The deep resection margin should include a thin layer of the intrinsic muscles because of a possible invasion of the submucosa. Generally, the wound is left to heal by secondary intention, although the defect may be partially closed primarily or covered with a skin graft.

Indication: Precancerous, superficial suspicious lesions, limited to the epithelium of the tongue without previous biopsy. The aim of surgery is to remove all the lesion with adequate margins up to the healthy tissue with both diagnostic and curative intent (Figure 2).

Selection of studies

Inclusion criteria

Studies investigating association(s) between TSCC and biomarkers
Studies reporting clinical significance(s) for biomarker expression
Studies investigating biomarker expressions in oral cavity when all samples were taken from the tongue
IHC studies encompassing multivariate analysis in statistical assessment
English full-text version available

Exclusion criteria

Studies investigating biomarkers in different anatomical subsites of oral cavity, and head and neck cancer
Studies unclear about clinical implications
Studies exclusively addressing the base of the tongue
Studies investigating biomarkers only in animals
Studies investigating micro-RNAs as biomarkers; these were already reviewedrecently for their clinical implications in TSCC
Case reports, letters to the Editor, and systematic reviews

Definition of the level of evidence and promising biomarkers

Biomarkers are usually classified based on the development pipeline, subdivided into 4 phases: exploratory, assay development and validation phase, retrospective validation studies, and prospective validation studies. However, since most of the TSCC biomarker studies are still in the exploratory phase with rather small sample sizes, we had to employ an alternative approach, based on the study of Teunissen and co-workers, which we slightly adapted (downscaled).

Ranking level of evidence (LoE)

Negative (−): Study reported no significant association between biomarker expression and clinical values
Weak (+): One study reported an association between biomarker expression and clinical values
Intermediate (++): 2 independent studies reported consistent evidence of an association between biomarker expression and clinical values
Strong (+++): ≥ 3 independent studies reported consistent evidence of an association between biomarker expression and clinical values

Only biomarkers with an intermediate or strong LoE, i.e. demonstrating a consistent association between their expression and specific clinical outcomes in at least two reports, were considered as promising biomarkers, even in the case that also neutral or opposite predicted outcomes were available for the same biomarker.

Data extraction

Included studies were classified into liquid and tissue-based biomarkers. These were further categorized according to the aforementioned LoE ranking into two groups:
Group A: studies with negative and weak LoE
Group B: studies with intermediate and strong LoE

Group B comprised all promising biomarkers, the master variable of interest of the current review. The studies of both groups were arranged according to year of publication, earliest to latest.

Since tissue biopsies were evaluated using various techniques, the tissue-based biomarkers were subdivided as follows:
Protein biomarkers
lnc RNA biomarkers
DNA biomarkers

Information about the biomarker studied, including its usefulness, sample type and size, the method of detection, expression level, type of mutation, and validity indices were listed in table format.

While the tongue is one of the frequent sites of LM, the lesion is often distributed widely over the neck rather than localized in the tongue. LM of the tongue not only cause cosmetic problems, such as protrusion from the mouth and bleeding, but also readily occupy the oropharyngeal cavity and cause functional problems such as disorder of mouth closing, difficulty in speaking, respiratory disturbances and impairment of oral food intake. These conditions are treated at departments including plastic surgery, oral surgery, otorhinolaryngology and pediatric surgery. LM of the tongue are treated by surgical resection or sclerotherapy, but comprehensive evaluation of the condition of individual cases including the distribution of the lesion in the tongue, involvement of other areas and cyst components, and vascular distribution in addition to general information, such as the risk of complications and recurrence in each treatment, is necessary.

Therefore, the CQ, "Is surgical resection effective for LM of the tongue?" was formulated, and the present knowledge about the effectiveness of surgical resection of the lesion, particularly by partial glossectomy was summarized.

Published work search and screening

As a result of the published work search, 29 papers in Japanese and 76 papers in English (75 from PubMed, one from Cochrane) were subjected to primary screening. Of these papers, two in Japanese and 10 in English were subjected to secondary screening concerning this CQ. They included one retrospective cohort study, but most other papers were case series or case reports. Consequently, in the evaluation of this CQ, the results and discussion of the cohort study and each case series were integrated.

Review of observational studies (case series)

The effectiveness of surgical resection of LM of the tongue was evaluated from the viewpoints of resectability of the lesion, symptoms, function and cosmetic improvements as elements of responses as well as complications and recurrence.

### Rethinking "posterior" tongue-tie [^224930e9]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, many clinicians who help with breastfeeding problems are diagnosing "posterior" tongue-tie in infants and performing or referring for frenotomy. In this "Speaking Out" article, I argue that the diagnosis of "posterior" tongue-tie has successfully raised awareness of the importance of impaired tongue function in breastfeeding difficulty. However, the diagnosis of "posterior" tongue-tie also applies a reductionist, medicalized theoretical frame to the complex problem of impaired tongue function, risking unintended outcomes. Impaired tongue function arises out of multiple interacting and co-evolving factors, including the interplay between social behaviors concerning breastfeeding and mother-infant biology. Consideration of theoretical frames is vital if we are to build an evidence base through efficient use of the scarce resources available for clinical breastfeeding research and minimize unintended outcomes.

### Burning red tongue with grooves [^ae12e939]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is associated with atrophic glossitis?
A. Use of corticosteroid spray
B. Celiac disease
C. Scarlet fever
D. Epstein-Barr virus
E. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

Answers:
A. Use of corticosteroid spray – Incorrect. Use of corticosteroid sprays and inhalers are both associated with median rhomboid glossitis. Other associations include smoking, wearing of dentures, HIV infection, and chronic Candida infection.
B. Celiac disease – Correct. Celiac disease, Sjogren syndrome, and sarcoidosis are all associated with atrophic glossitis. Other common underlying conditions associated with atrophic glossitis include nutritional deficiencies (iron, folic acid, vitamin B 12, riboflavin, niacin), alcoholism, iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, xerostomia, and infection (systemic or local).
C. Scarlet fever – Incorrect. Scarlet fever, from a group A streptococcus infection, is associated with strawberry tongue. Over the course of a few days, the tongue progresses from white strawberry tongue to red.
D. Epstein-Barr virus – Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with oral hairy leukoplakia. White lesions with a hairy appearance will appear on the lateral margins of the tongue.
E. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome – Incorrect. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a cause of macroglossia, or enlarged tongue. Macroglossia can be congenital or acquired, and a tongue that is out of proportion to jaw size will be seen.

### Chemosensory functions after glossectomy – A cross-sectional pilot study [^e70b3862]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, chemosensory functions were neither affected by reconstruction, PEG dependency, prior RT nor CRT nor the time interval between testing and therapy. Insignificant results could be due, at least partially, to the small overall size. Subsequent studies with larger patient cohorts are therefore warranted. However, our results regarding taste impairment after RT or CRT are in line with recent findings showing a significant decrease of overall taste sensation during and at the end of RT that recovers significantly or even resolves after the end of RT. Altogether, this data support the theory of time‐limited negative influence of RT on taste sensation in head and neck cancer patients.,

The evaluation of fundamental functions such as, swallowing, physiological breathing, and understandable verbal communication are usually prioritized after major head and neck cancer surgeries, while chemosensory functions are secondary. However, an increasing number of studies highlight the importance of gustatory and olfactory senses for an adequate QoL in non‐oncological patients. As the tongue represents the main host of gustatory sensation, our patient collective should be of great interest from a chemosensensory scientific point of view. Despite that, appropriate data and studies done on head and neck cancer patients with proper psychophysical chemosensory testing are still rare, as the majority of works report only of single psychophysical chemosensory tests or self‐assessments of chemosensory function.

### Ustekinumab-induced amelioration of both palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriatic glossitis [^e24af804]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may affect any body area, including sensitive sites such as face, nails, scalp, hands, palms, feet, and genitals. Although less frequent, severe forms of either geographic or fissured tongue accounting for psoriasis manifestations can also occur. The involvement of these sites may lead to a marked impairment of quality of life, interfering with work productivity, leisure, and social activities. According to current guidelines, the therapeutic approach for psoriasis of these particular sites, although localized and classified as mild or mild-to-moderate, might require systemic therapies, including biologics.

### Common oral lesions [^576645c4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Familiarity with common oral conditions allows clinicians to observe and treat patients in the primary care setting or refer to a dentist, oral surgeon, otolaryngologist, or other specialist. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the most common ulcerative condition of the oral cavity. Recurrent herpes simplex labialis and stomatitis also commonly cause oral ulcers. Corticosteroids, immunocompromise, antibiotics, and dentures can predispose patients to oral candidiasis. Benign migratory glossitis (geographic tongue) occurs in up to 3% of the population but generally lacks symptoms, although some people experience food sensitivity or a burning sensation. Hairy tongue is associated with a low fiber diet, tobacco and alcohol use, and poor oral hygiene in older male patients. Generally, hairy tongue is asymptomatic except for an unattractive appearance or halitosis. Tobacco and alcohol use can cause mucosal changes resulting in leukoplakia and erythroplakia. These can represent precancerous changes and increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Mandibular and maxillary tori are common bony cortical outgrowths that require no treatment in the absence of repeat trauma from chewing or interference with dentures. Oral lichen planus occurs in up to 2% of individuals and can present as lacy reticulations or oral erosions and ulcerations. Traumatic buccal mucosal fibromas and labial mucoceles from biting can be excised.

### Risk factors for gastric-tube dependence following tongue reconstruction [^1c8756e7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative dysphagia is not uncommon following significant glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. To develop effective treatments for this patient population, risk factors for postoperative dysphagia must be accurately identified. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify independent risk factors for dysphagia following microvascular tongue reconstruction.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of 222 patients who had undergone microvascular tongue reconstruction after significant glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. The variables examined were age, sex, preoperative body mass index (BMI), history of radiotherapy (RT) to the neck, smoking, alcohol drinking, clinical tumor stage, extent of the defect (tongue, mandible, soft palate, and neck dissection), and postoperative RT. Postoperative dysphagia was defined as gastric-tube dependence for nutrition at the time of evaluation. Possible risk factors for gastric-tube dependence were subjected to univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

A total of 33 patients (14.9%) had dysphagia at the time of evaluation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age ≥ 70 years, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, and, most significantly, postoperative RT as significant risk factors for gastric-tube dependence after tongue reconstruction. Clinical tumor stage (stage IV/recurrence), subtotal or total glossectomy and full-thickness resection of the soft palate were identified as significant factors on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

The present study has identified age ≥ 70 years, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, and, especially, postoperative RT as significant risk factors for gastric-tube dependence after tongue reconstruction. These factors should be considered when selecting treatments for patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal cancers.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^d5d3d72d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass — key action statements (KAS) algorithm begins with "Adult with Neck Mass" and the decision "Signs and symptoms of bacterial infection?"

### First impressions: setting the stage for better relationships [^f0157893]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Several authors have reported that the extent of tongue resection was the most important determinant of functional outcome after tongue reconstruction. – Our data also showed that worsening of swallowing function was directly related to the extent of tongue defect. However, type 4 defects (total oral glossectomy without involving the base of the tongue) have a relatively favorable outcome (95.5% of patients were not dependent on the feeding tube), which corroborates the importance of the high swallowing pressures produced at the tongue base.

Low BMI and low serum albumin levels are associated with a significantly increased risk of postoperative feeding tube dependence. This fact suggests high prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia, which negatively affect quality of life in dysphagia patients. Poor general health conditions indicated by ASA physical status, comorbid hypertension, and diabetes are also associated with postoperative feeding tube dependence. Comorbid cerebral disease also increased the risk of postoperative feeding tube dependence, probably because of dysphagia related to brain dysfunction. However, anemia indicated by low hemoglobin levels, comorbid cardiac dysrhythmia, and peripheral vascular diseases were not risk factors for postoperative feeding tube dependence.

Resection beyond the tongue, into the palate, tonsilla, and/or mandible is related to swallowing dysfunction, as described previously. – In cases of extensive or complex head and neck defects, multiple simultaneous microvascular free flap reconstructions may be necessary to maximize quality of life in patients with advanced disease. Patients who underwent laryngeal suspension and/or cricopharyngeal myotomy showed a trend of postoperative feeding tube dependence, although these procedures were applied to improve swallowing function. This is explained by the fact that cricopharyngeal myotomy, laryngeal suspension, or both are often performed in patients considered at high risk of dysphagia, such as those with excision of the bilateral suprahyoid muscles. Surgeons identified these patients as being at high risk of dysphasia and performed the procedures to reduce the risk; however, this obviously did not fully accomplish the goals. Edentulous patients had a high risk of swallowing dysfunction, consistent with previous findings. Such patients use the tongue instead of the teeth to stabilize the mandible, which is an important part of swallowing. Dental therapies including prosthetic implants and dentures are considered to have clinical benefits.

### Fungiform papillary glossitis: atopic disease in the mouth? [^39359f88]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma, eczema and hay fever are the classical manifestations of atopic disease. Geographic tongue (benign migratory glossitis) has also been reported to be a manifestation. Anecdotally, atopic people frequently report irritation of the tongue by heat and certain foods, which may be more common than realized.

Objectives

To determine whether atopic people have an increased likelihood of a sensitive tongue manifest as inflamed fungiform papillae and a history of irritation by certain foods.

Patients/Methods

A descriptive classification of inflammation of the fungiform papillae on the tongue was developed using a 9-point analogue scale where 1 was considered normal and 9 was considered to be severely inflamed. An opportunistic sample of participants were classified as atopic or not on the basis of a personal history of asthma, eczema or hay fever. An examination of the tongue was performed using the classification and then a questionnaire was administered on whether they burnt their tongue easily with hot food and whether they were irritated by certain foods.

Results

There were 200 participants aged 20 years and over of whom 104 (52%) were classified as atopic on the basis of the personal history. There was a significant positive association between increasingly inflamed fungiform papillae and the likelihood of being atopic. There was also a positive association between increasing inflammation of the fungiform papillae and a history of both burning the tongue easily and irritation of the tongue by food. There was an increased likelihood of a history of irritation of the tongue with certain foods amongst atopic participants and they were also more likely to burn their tongue with hot food than those who were nonatopic.

Conclusion

Atopic people are more likely than the normal community to have inflammation of the fungiform papillae of their tongue which correlates with a history of a sensitive tongue manifest as irritation by heat and certain foods. These data suggest that atopic disease may occur in the mouth as a common inflammatory change on the tongue-fungiform papillary glossitis.

### Prognostic significance of lymph node density in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue [^1a326e2d]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic significance of lymph node density in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been well recognized. However, its use in a specific subsite of the tongue has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of lymph node density in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 99 patients with tongue SCC who underwent primary curative resection and neck dissection was conducted. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of lymph node density.

Results

Lymph node density (using a cutoff of 0.06) was shown to be an independent predictor of OS and DSS. The impact of lymph node density on OS and DSS remained significant on multivariate analysis, whereas conventional nodal staging was not. An alternative staging strategy incorporating depth of invasion and lymph node density performs better than conventional TNM staging in predicting survival.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that lymph node density is a reliable and applicable predictor of prognosis in patients with tongue SCC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E859-E866, 2016.

### A review of the most promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of tongue squamous cell carcinoma [^d95378ab]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since pathology and radiology, the current keys to TSCC diagnosis and treatment decisions, are essentially visual subjective measures that are labor-intensive with limitations in diagnostic accuracy, there has been an intensified interest in biomarkers as an objective alternative and more accurate tool for early diagnosis, prognosis, or personalized treatment. A plethora of TSCC biomarker studies have been published, however, virtually all biomarkers are still in early stages of development, and far from potential application in a clinical setting. This review aimed to drive the acceleration of TSCC biomarker validation by providing an inventory of currently evaluated TSCC biomarkers across different sample sources, including saliva, serum/plasma, and tissues, and by highlighting promising biomarkers that consistently showed clinical relevance in two or more publications.

Overall, we noticed an abundance of studies that described single or multiple biomarkers only in one publication (66%), whereas there has been no corresponding increase in the validated ones. This may be due to the current pressure from journals to only publish innovative research, which prohibits researchers to perform sound repeat studies providing independent confirmation of the initial identification of a potentially promising biomarker. Since it remains in this exploratory phase pivotal to determine which biomarker is potentially promising and should be prioritized for further steps of confirmation, high-quality studies should be performed. In this regard, although we have noticed that the majority of the studied biomarkers in these discovery studies showed significant results, we observed several shortcomings affecting the reliability of their value. For example, in some publications only the data of a small number of patients are presented, while in others study designs are not the optimal or statistical design was unpowered. Two strategies should be implemented to improve this situation: one should emphasize on validation and confirmation of biomarkers that have already shown unbiased assessment in at least one publication, and the other is to conduct future research based on sound scientific and well-planned study designs so that reporting can be done according to guidelines such as REMARK for prognostic biomarkers.

### Inflammatory tongue conditions and risk of oral tongue cancer among the US elderly individuals [^f3c9d194]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The incidence of oral tongue cancers has increased since the 1980s among US men and women for unknown reasons. We investigated associations of inflammatory tongue conditions with risk of cancers of the oral tongue, other oral cavity, and oropharynx among the US elderly individuals (age 65 years or older).

Methods

We conducted a case-control study (2,534 oral tongue cancers, 6,832 other oral cavity cancers, 9,373 oropharyngeal cancers, and 200,000 controls) within the SEER-Medicare data set (1992–2013). Medicare records were used to identify patients with clinically diagnosed inflammatory tongue conditions (glossitis, benign migratory glossitis, median rhomboid glossitis, atrophic glossitis, glossodynia, other specified conditions [eg, atrophy and hypertrophy], and other unspecified conditions) and oral precancer (leukoplakia/erythroplakia). Only conditions preceding cancer/control selection by > 12 months were included.

Results

The prevalence of inflammatory tongue conditions was significantly higher in patients with tongue cancer than controls (6.0% v 0.6%; odds ratios [ORs], adjusted for age, sex, race, Medicare utilization, and precancer, 5.8 [95% CI, 4.7 to 7.2]). This overall association primarily arose from glossitis, 5.6 (95% CI, 4.4 to 7.2); other specified conditions, 9.1 (95% CI, 5.5 to 15.2); and other unspecified conditions, 13.7 (95% CI, 8.0 to 23.7). These associations remained strongly elevated > 5 years preceding tongue cancer (arguing against reverse causation), for conditions diagnosed by a specialist (arguing against misclassification), and among patients who received an oral biopsy (arguing against missed cancer). During 2013, an estimated 1 in 11 patients with oral tongue cancer had a preceding diagnosis of inflammatory tongue conditions. Associations of inflammatory tongue conditions were relatively weak for other oral cavity cancers (ORs, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.3]) and oropharyngeal cancer (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6]) and were observed only closest to cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion

Inflammatory tongue conditions were associated with strongly increased risks of oral tongue cancers and preceded cancer diagnosis by several years, underscoring the need for increased clinical surveillance among patients with such apparently benign diagnoses.

### From the tongue to the gut [^276f29ab]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The physiology of human taste experienced an unprecedented expansion of knowledge brought forward by modern genetics and molecular biology. In the last 10 years, the cellular organization of taste receptors from taste buds distributed in the various papillae of the tongue and the soft palate was enlightened. This molecular revolution rapidly expanded over and above the tongue because several papers reporting the presence of taste receptors in nongustatory tissues (eg, gut, brain) appeared. Hence, the issue of perception of food molecules is no longer confined to the field of nutrition and food preferences, but is rapidly expanding to gastrointestinal (GI) function and, possibly, to gut dysfunction. In children, functional GI diseases are strictly correlated to food preference and food aversion and up to now, the tools to address these kinds of problems were basic nutritional requirements, familial good sense, and a lot of patience: blunt tools to face extremely common and disturbing complaints. The fact that taste receptors are expressed down the whole of the intestinal tract is of particular interest because of their possible role in digestive behavior and absorption of nutrients; therefore, recent and future discoveries in this field will make possible the fine-tuning of new, sharper tools to treat children with functional GI diseases.

### The ptotic tongue-imaging appearance and pathology localization along the course of the hypoglossal nerve [^4d6addc6]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical findings of hypoglossal nerve injury

The hypoglossal nerve is a pure motor nerve, supplying all the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus, a branch of the vagus nerve with additional contribution from the spinal accessory and possibly glossopharyngeal nerves. Each hypoglossal nucleus receives bilateral input from the primary motor cortex via the corticobulbar tract with the genioglossus receiving crossed innervation.

Balanced action of the bilateral genioglossus muscles is necessary to protrude the tongue in the midline without lateral deviation. Thus, hypoglossal palsy may present clinically with dysphagia, dysarthria, or subjective tongue weakness. Examination may reveal unilateral tongue hemiatrophy, deviation, or fasciculations. Unilateral supranuclear lesions rarely cause profound muscle weakness but may cause deviation of the tongue to the contralateral side from the lesion. By contrast, nuclear or infranuclear hypoglossal pathology will lead to tongue deviation toward the side of pathology. Coexistence of other cranial neuropathies may help to further guide clinical and imaging localization of pathology.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to discuss imaging techniques and provide a pictorial review of pediatric tongue lesions. CONCLUSION. Pediatric tongue lesions represent an often-overlooked collection of abnormalities with a variety of clinical and radiologic features. The location of these lesions places the patient at risk for airway compromise. Systematic imaging evaluation of pediatric tongue lesions can help the radiologist arrive at a correct and timely diagnosis, thus improving and expediting patient care.

### Black hairy tongue: predisposing factors, diagnosis, and treatment [^399071af]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Black hairy tongue (BHT) is a benign condition commonly found among people who smoke, have poor oral hygiene, are immunocompromised, or have a medical condition limiting their ability to practice good oral hygiene. Though this condition is harmless, patients need to be educated on etiology as many common medications are associated with this condition. Patients being placed on certain antibiotics or antipsychotics should be educated on the importance of good oral hygiene or cessation of habits that promote BHT. Similarly, those with medical conditions increasing the risk for the development of BHT should schedule routine visits with their dentist or dental hygienist. Prognosis is good, and treatment consists of gentle brushing of the tongue, but many anecdotal reports exist demonstrating the use of medications or other products to treat this condition. This review addresses the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, etiology, histology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of BHT and lists all of the medications reported to cause this condition.

### Reply to' comment on' prognostic biomarkers for oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^b3886760]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Sir,

We thank Dr Jayaraj and Mr Kumarasamy for their comments on our meta-analysis. Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) has a different behaviour compared with SCC of other subsites of the oral cavity. In the analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, Rusthoven et al found that OTSCC is associated with worse survival compared with SCC originating in other oral cavity subsites. In the analysis of a large cohort of another population, patients with OTSCC were reported to have more tendency to neck failure, one of the most consistent prognosis factors, than those with SCC of buccal mucosa. Furthermore, Trivedi et al have studied the prognostic value of many biomarkers using immunohistochemistry of buccal and tongue carcinomas, and they concluded that these two subsites of the oral cavity have different biological behaviours, which was reflected in their prognostic analysis. Variations in the prognostic significance of the histopathologic markers have also been reported between the oral SCC subsites. Therefore, it is quite common in the literature that researchers evaluate prognostic biomarkers of OTSCC separately from other subsites of the oral cavity, in order to have homogenous cohorts that provide more accurate data than mixed cohorts. Accordingly, we argue that our focus on studies of OTSCC provides a more accurate meta-analysis and more specific conclusions.

### Management of MACROGLOSSIA: case series and suggested algorithm [^80a9bff1]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Idiopathic macroglossia is a rare entity of true tongue enlargement without an underlying etiology. There are only a few case reports on the diagnosis and management of idiopathic macroglossia. This study's purpose was to present a series of patients with idiopathic macroglossia and suggest a treatment algorithm.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series of a cohort of patients with macroglossia who were treated by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth)and Emory University. The patient's medical comorbidities, history of present illness, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and disease management were studied. The outcome variables include normalization of the tongue size, dependence on parenteral nutrition, and tolerating tracheostomy decannulation.

Results

Five patients with a mean age of 45 years were included in the study. All of the patients (n = 5, 100%) in our cohort developed macroglossia following prolonged oral intubation, with 3.5 weeks being the average length of intubation. All patients presented with difficulty feeding orally and breathing. The average tongue dimension was 12.20 x 6.25 cm. All tongue enlargements were located in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, and all patients had displaced anterior dentition. In addition, 60% of the patients (n = 3) experienced altered tongue sensation (pain and/or decreased taste). These patients were surgically managed with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement followed by partial glossectomy (n = 5, 100%). We defined successful outcomes as 1) modifying the tongue to a functional, nonprotruding form, 2) tracheostomy decannulation and 3) PEG tube removal. Tracheostomy decannulation and PEG tube removal were achieved in 80% of the patients (n = 4).

Conclusions

In this patient cohort, we were unable to identify the cause of the pathology based on existing clinical data. When the etiology is unclear or irreversible, management should involve tracheostomy and surgical feeding access for the initial stabilization, followed by modified glossectomy to improve form, function, and cosmesis thereby improving the overall quality of life.

### Skin barrier development depends on CGI-58 protein expression during late-stage keratinocyte differentiation [^46c8e587]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Epidermal CGI-58 is a prerequisite for functional skin barrier formation

To generate mice lacking CGI-58 exclusively in the epidermis, we bred mice expressing the Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the epidermis-specific human keratin 14 (K14) promoter with mice homozygous for the Cgi-58 - floxed allele (Cgi-58 flox/flox). Very similar to mice globally lacking CGI-58, Cgi-58 flox/flox mice heterozygous for the K14 - Cre recombinase transgene (Cgi-58 epid −/−) died within 12 hours after birth and exhibited a glossy tight skin (Figure 1a). Western blotting experiments revealed that CGI-58 protein expression was not detectable in the epidermis of Cgi-58 epid −/− mice, mildly reduced in the dermis, and unchanged in liver, lung, and heart when compared with levels in Cgi-58 flox/flox controls (Supplementary Figure S1 online). Reduced CGI-58 protein expression in the tongue is in accordance with K14 expression in tongue epithelial cells. Morphologically, newborn Cgi-58 epid −/− mice were smaller and wet weight was reduced (−25%) compared with Cgi-58 flox/flox littermates (Figure 1b). Plasma energy substrates including FA, glycerol, TG, and glucose were markedly decreased in Cgi-58 epid −/− mice (ranging from −47% to −86%) compared with controls (Table 1), which may derive from the absence of suckling in newborn Cgi-58 epid −/− mice.

### Common oral lesions: part I. superficial mucosal lesions [^ded97a1e]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus. Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size, location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis, or perlèche (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations. Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled trials.

American Dental Association guideline — screening, evaluation, and clinical examination definitions: A target condition is defined as "a disease or health outcome of interest". The glossary distinguishes that "Screening is the process by which a practitioner sees a patient without symptoms to determine whether he or she is likely or unlikely to have a condition or disease", while "Evaluation generally involves a broader survey of patients, both with and without symptoms, including a review of their medical, social, and dental history and a physical assessment". It further defines conventional visual and tactile examination (CVTE) as "the systematic visual inspection of the head and neck", including examination of "the face, lips, and mouth tissues under white-light illumination for any signs or clinically detectable tissue abnormality or morphologic change, such as changes in size, color, and texture", and expands the abbreviation as "CVTE: Conventional visual and tactile examination".

### Mutations in IL36RN are associated with geographic tongue [^def4149c]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Geographic tongue (GT [MIM:137400]), also known as benign migratory glossitis (BMG), is a benign inflammatory disorder of the tongue characterized by erythematous lesions of desquamated filiform papillae, which is usually delineated by raised, white, circinate lines (Assimakopoulos et al.). The prevalence of GT varies from 0.2 to 14.29% (Furlanetto et al.), but most surveys show a range between 1.0 and 2.5% (Assimakopoulos et al.) while the etiology of GT remains unknown. Several GT-associated conditions have been reported, such as generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), heredity, allergies, hormonal disturbances, juvenile diabetes, stress and Down syndrome (Assimakopoulos et al; Redman et al.). Among them, GPP was commonly proposed to be an associated factor. This was based on the evidence of an increased prevalence of geographic tongue in GPP patients (Morris et al.), similar histological findings in both the skin and tongue lesions (Femiano), and the parallel improvement of both entities after anti-psoriatic treatment (Tholen and Lubach). IL36RN was first identified as the causative gene for GPP patients in 2011 and the definition of DITRA (deficiency of interleukin 36-receptor antagonist) was proposed (Marrakchi et al; Onoufriadis et al.). However, the molecular mechanism of GT has not been described.

In 2013, we reported mutations in IL36RN gene in 68 Chinese patients with GPP (Li et al.). At the follow-up visits, a high prevalence of GT in both GPP patients and their non-GPP family members was observed. This interesting phenomenon aroused our interests in studying the relationship between the IL36RN gene and expression of GT, in individuals both with, and without, GPP.

### Ustekinumab-induced amelioration of both palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriatic glossitis [^2e8d989f]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Skin manifestations in sensitive areas are frequently observed, as facial involvement is reported in up to two-thirds of patients with psoriasis, whereas palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriatic glossitis is seen in 11% to 39% and 9.8% to 47.5% of patients, respectively. Although geographic and fissured tongue are nonspecific oral manifestations that can be associated with psoriasis, a limited number of reports described a good response to antipsoriatic therapies (Table I).,

Table I
Previously described cases of psoriatic glossitis treated with antipsoriatic treatments

Psoriasis affecting sensitive sites may negatively affect QoL, with severe consequences on both daily and leisure activities, as in our patient. For this reason, these patients deserve appropriate treatment, even if their disease is limited in extension and cannot be considered severe (PASI < 10). Based on national and international registry data, ustekinumab was proven the safest and the most effective therapy compared with other biologic agents. Considering patients' preferences in the choice of treatment, a low treatment frequency was identified as a key factor for females, younger people, and working patients; therefore, it has been associated with an improved adherence. Ustekinumab has the lowest number of injections per year, and its use was associated with an improvement in patients' adherencecompared with both tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and anti–interleukin-17 agents. The latter has yet to be approved in pediatric patients affected by psoriasis.

Among those agents approved to treat subjects younger than 18 years, 27 adalimumab injections occur during the first year of treatment (for children between 4 and 17 years of age and > 30 kg, as in our case, injections must be administered every other week starting 1 week after a first dose of 40 mg), etanercept can be used as intermittent therapy, as a 24-week treatment (24 injections) and eventual retreatment after interruption can be prescribed in pediatric patients according to labeled instructions, whereas ustekinumab injections are 6 in the first year. To our knowledge, this is the first case of oral psoriasis successfully treated with ustekinumab, that induced a rapid remission (in 12 weeks) of psoriatic mucocutaneous manifestations and resolution of pain and discomfort associated with an improvement in patient's QoL.

It clarifies adjuncts/index tests as "An adjunct is a test, device, technique, or technology marketed to assist primary care clinicians, possibly as a triage test, in the detection of PMDs or seemingly malignant lesions for the assessment of their biological relevance". The criterion standard is specified as "A biopsy followed by histopathologic assessment, a procedure used to detect dysplasia, is the criterion standard diagnostic test for PMDs and OSCC". Diagnostic accuracy is established because "An index test for a given lesion or condition is evaluated for diagnostic accuracy by comparison with a reference standard or criterion standard diagnostic test", and a positive outcome is defined as "A true-positive test result indicates that an adjunct correctly helped identify a patient as having a PMD or malignant disorder".

### Prevalence and significance of human papillomavirus in oral tongue cancer: the mayo clinic experience [^c169617f]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cigarette smoking and alcohol use have markedly decreased in the past 40 years. However, there has been an increasing trend in the incidence of tongue cancer, particularly in young patients without traditional risk factors. This study sought to examine the prevalence and significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its clinical significance in patients with oral tongue cancer.

Patients and Methods

Fresh-frozen tissues from 51 patients with oral tongue cancer, treated with primary surgery from January 2004 to December 2006, were included in the study. The presence of HPV infection in tumor specimens was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with HPV L1 consensus primers (GP 5+/GP 6+) and HPV-16-specific E6 primer pairs. Demographic and clinical data were collected to analyze patient outcomes.

Results

The overall frequency of HPV in oral tongue cancer in our study was 1.96% (1/51). Young patients below the age of 45 years accounted for 15.7% (8/51) of the total number of patients. Eighty-seven percent of the younger age group, including a single patient with an HPV-16-positive tumor, were alive and free from disease during the follow-up period. The overall survival of the study group was 81.4%.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the incidence of HPV in oral tongue cancer is low and is unlikely to play a significant role in the etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes of oral tongue cancer. In addition, HPV is unlikely to constitute a significant factor in the rising trend of oral tongue cancer in the young population.

### From image to diagnosis: convolutional neural networks in tongue lesions [^57ded39c]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical examination of the tongue is essential for diagnosing systemic and local diseases. However, traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective evaluation. Artificial intelligence, particularly convolutional neural networks, has shown promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. This study aimed to classify common tongue lesions using convolutional neural networks, improving diagnostic precision in routine dental examinations. A dataset of 1038 tongue images was analyzed, categorized into six classes: healthy, coated, fissured, hairy, geographic, and median rhomboid glossitis. The ResNet18 model was employed for binary classification, and ResNet50 for three-class classification. Preprocessing techniques, including image resizing and augmentation, were applied to optimize model performance. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ResNet18 model achieved 100% accuracy in distinguishing healthy from hairy tongue lesions and demonstrated high performance in binary classification tasks. The ResNet50 model reached 96% accuracy for healthy-coated-hairy classification but faced challenges with other lesion groups. CNN-based models provide an effective, non-invasive tool for classifying tongue lesions, with ResNet18 excelling in binary classification. The findings suggest that artificial intelligence integration in maxillofacial radiology can enhance diagnostic reliability in routine dental practice. Further studies with larger datasets and real-time clinical applications are recommended to refine artificial intelligence-driven diagnostic tools.

### Impact of close margins on oral cancer outcomes according to the oral subsite [^77126237]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations to our study. These include the retrospective nature and the differences between the tongue and non‐tongue groups. There may also be arbitrariness in some cases regarding the distinction between tongue and FOM cancers. A further important limitation is that the non‐tongue cohort comprises a heterogeneous group of subsites, and therefore our findings may not be automatically generalizable to all non‐tongue subsites. In particular, previous authors have reported an adverse impact of close margins on outcomes among buccal cancers, and inspection of the Kaplan–Meier curves of buccal cases in the present series would also suggest an adverse impact for close margins, albeit the number of cases was too small to show a significant impact. Given the small number of buccal SCC cases, we felt it was more appropriate to include them as non‐tongue cases in the present series than to selectively exclude them; however, our findings may not be generalizable to this subsite. Another point is that while it was a strength of our study that margins were calculated based on the main specimen, our findings may not be generalizable to cases where final margin clearance is calculated including extensions to the resection indicated by intraoperative specimen‐driven margin assessment. Finally, it is possible that our study was underpowered to detect a significant difference for close margins on LR of non‐tongue cancers. However, our purpose was to examine whether close margins in OSCC have a differential impact on LR based on the subsite, and, given that we showed a clear impact on LR for close margins with tongue cancer in a smaller cohort than the non‐tongue cohort, this suggests at least a more significant impact of close margins on outcomes among tongue than non‐tongue sites.

### The ptotic tongue-imaging appearance and pathology localization along the course of the hypoglossal nerve [^8a8d6bc4]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

CT and MRI findings of tongue ptosis and atrophy should alert radiologists to potential pathology along the course of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), a purely motor cranial nerve which supplies the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. While relatively specific for hypoglossal nerve pathology, these findings do not accurately localize the site or cause of denervation. A detailed understanding of the anatomic extent of the nerve, which crosses multiple anatomic spaces, is essential to identify possible underlying pathology, which ranges from benign postoperative changes to life-threatening medical emergencies. This review will describe key imaging findings of tongue denervation, segmental anatomy of the hypoglossal nerve, imaging optimization, and comprehensive imaging examples of diverse pathology which may affect the hypoglossal nerve. Armed with this knowledge, radiologists will increase their sensitivity for detection of pathology and provide clinically relevant differential diagnoses when faced with findings of tongue ptosis and denervation.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement on ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads [^ee5ec5b2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement — ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads defines tongue-tie as limitation of tongue movement from a restrictive sublingual frenulum and outlines anatomic, biomechanical, and clinical implications. A tongue-tie exists when tongue range of movement and function are limited by a restrictive sublingual frenulum, and the sublingual frenulum is described as a fold of oral mucosa that arises with tongue elevation, sometimes including floor of mouth fascia or fascia and genioglossus muscle, and is not a histologically discrete band. Ultrasound imagery associates specific tongue movements and nipple position with effective and comfortable breastfeeding, with vacuum increasing as the tongue lowers and decreasing as it elevates, and the tactile presence of breast tissue in the oral cavity triggering lower jaw excursion followed by the tongue to generate a seal-based vacuum. Clinically, a restrictive sublingual frenulum reducing tongue movement may cause a significant functional impediment to latch, suckling, and milk transfer, along with maternal nipple/areolar discomfort and trauma, increasing risk of discontinuing breastfeeding; maternal reports may include latching difficulties, nipple pain, poor breast drainage, prolonged feeding sessions, and inadequate infant satiation. The document also notes a lack of agreement regarding diagnosis and treatment of tongue-tie across regions and professions.

### Geographic tongue and tenofovir [^3d5d4004]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old male patient with chronic hepatitis B was started on tenofovir. One month after initiating the new medication, he developed severe symptomatology with odynophagia and a very painful tongue. The physical examination reveals multiple erythematous patches on his tongue and a biopsy was performed. It allowed the diagnosis of benign migratory glossitis or geographic tongue. The patient was kept on tenofovir, but had to start topical corticoid therapy. Geographic tongue is a common condition that may be caused by drug idiosyncrasy, but has never before been associated to tenofovir. It is usually asymptomatic, but sometimes it causes severe symptoms, being an important impairment of quality of life.

Pain in the tongue or oral tissues described as "burning" has been referred to by many terms including burning mouth syndrome. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. When burning mouth syndrome occurs in the absence of identified risk indicators, the term primary burning mouth syndrome is utilized. This article focuses on descriptions, etiologic theories, and management of primary burning mouth syndrome, a condition for which underlying causative agents have been ruled out.

Herpetic geometric glossitis is an uncommon, clinically distinctive presentation of oral herpes simplex virus infection that affects the tongue. All published reports have been in patients who are immunocompromised. We present an immunocompetent woman with viral pneumonia who developed painful linear fissures on the back of the tongue suggestive of herpetic geometric glossitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by both biopsy specimen and immunohistochemistry. As in other cases, the patient promptly responded to treatment with antiviral therapy. The morphology, laboratory findings, and similarities to herpetic corneal dendrites are discussed. Herpetic geometric glossitis should no longer be considered as a diagnosis only in immunosuppressed individuals, but in immunocompetent persons as well.

### Congenital macroglossia treated by 2-stage partial glossectomy [^118224c9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Persistent macroglossia affects speech, swallowing, and the dentofacial skeleton. A range of tongue reduction methods have been proposed to preserve the mobility and sensation of the tongue. However, recent reports have shown that speech or esthetic problems still exists, even after a comprehensive glossectomy in early childhood. Because a large volume reduction of the anterior tongue in young growing children might result in a short tongue tip with functional difficulties, it is important to select the appropriate tongue reduction method considering the growth of the tongue. In the current report, a staged tongue reduction was planned to minimize the functional and esthetic problems after surgery. A 3-year-old girl visited our clinic because of congenital macroglossia, phonation problems, and prognathic appearance of the mandible. The tongue was first reduced by a central glossectomy. The speech intelligibility, tongue movement, and skeletal growth pattern were improved after the first surgery. The secondary peripheral tongue reduction was performed 6 years later to achieve an esthetically pleasing tongue appearance. This 2-stage partial glossectomy, central tongue reduction first followed later by a peripheral tongue reduction, ensures functional integrity of the tongue and can provide an esthetically pleasing result in growing children. The results demonstrated that this strategic combination of a staged tongue reduction can be a successful treatment option for macroglossia.

### Burning red tongue with grooves [^44602b93]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is associated with fissured tongue?
A. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome
B. Reactive arthritis
C. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
D. Smoking/tobacco use
E. Chewing trauma to the tongue

Answers:
A. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome – Correct. Although fissured tongue is most commonly idiopathic, especially in older patients, it is also associated with a number of diseases. Along with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, other common associations include Down syndrome, Sjogren syndrome, Cowden syndrome, acromegaly, and psoriasis.
B. Reactive arthritis – Incorrect. Geographic tongue, not fissured tongue, can occur in association with reactive arthritis. The exact cause of geographic tongue is unknown, although it does display a familial tendency.
C. Broad-spectrum antibiotics – Incorrect. Antibiotic and topical steroid use is associated with acute atrophic candidiasis, in which there is desquamation, erythematous patches, and a strong burning sensation. Antifungal agents act as appropriate therapy.
D. Smoking/tobacco use – Incorrect. Tobacco use is associated with hairy tongue, in which excess keratin collects on the lingual papillae, thus creating long hair-like strands. Daily gentle scraping will remove the excess keratin.
E. Chewing trauma to the tongue – Incorrect. Chewing trauma is not associated with fissured tongue. This trauma normally occurs on the lateral edges of the tongue and can be associated with linea alba, which is a thin white line of thickened epithelium at the site of the trauma.

### A review of the most promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of tongue squamous cell carcinoma [^c1e7c85e]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and largest review that evaluated specifically TSCC biomarkers across different sources, including saliva, serum/plasma, and tissues in an integral manner. The included studies used various types of assays for analysis, which allowed us to explore more details about the currently evaluated TSCC biomarkers. In addition, based on a staged approach of a biomarker validation in which one publication does not provide a meaningful role of the biomarkers as a measure of disease activity, unless more consistent evidence is available supporting its utility, we used the wide and comprehensive set of data identified here provided a shortlist of qualifying promising biomarkers. Nevertheless, our findings should be understood in the context of some limitations, which may have introduced some bias in our assessments. Firstly, we did not consider the number of patients tested in our evidence rating of the promising biomarkers due to the scarcity of the subjects in several studies. Secondly, we have included IHC studies only from 2010 onwards, consequently, it cannot be excluded that some confirmatory studies for some protein biomarkers were missed. Another limitation is that our search strategy is based on the PUBMED search engine only, which may not have revealed all relevant studies. Furthermore, validation of a biomarker such as a prolactin that emerged as one of the promising biomarkers in this review was entirely based on several studies from the same authors and this reduces the robustness of the finding. Even though, the authors followed the rule of thumb by increasing number of the patients in the confirmatory studies, further elucidation in different patient cohorts performed by different research groups to evaluate its value in forecasting prognosis should be conducted.

### Burning pain on the upper labial mucosa [^696306d3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Geographic tongue shares strong similarities with what common dermatologic condition?
A. Psoriasis
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Pityriasis rosea
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus
E. Rosacea

Answers:
A. Psoriasis – Correct. Current literature suggests clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical similarities between geographic tongue and psoriasis. In fact, some authors have argued that geographic tongue may represent oral manifestations of psoriasis, although this remains controversial. Moreover, a systemic review and meta-analysis indicated an association between geographic tongue and psoriasis (odds ratio: 3.53; 95% CI: [2.56–4.86]; P = 0.03). Interestingly, this patient had a streptococcal exposure, new onset headache, and was treated empirically for streptococcal pharyngitis at the time of lip symptoms. There is a well-established association between acute guttate psoriasis and preceding streptococcal infection. If ectopic geographic tongue shares similarities to the immune-mediated pathogenesis of psoriasis, it raises the possibility that the lesions on the patient's upper labial mucosa occurred secondary to streptococcal infection.
B. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between erythema multiforme and geographic tongue.
C. Pityriasis rosea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between pityriasis rosea and geographic tongue.
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between discoid lupus erythematosus and geographic tongue.
E. Rosacea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between rosacea and geographic tongue.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement on ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads [^08941149]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Frenotomy — indications in breastfeeding dyads specify that "Classic tongue-tie is a fold of mucosa and sometimes fascia… that restricts its function", and if it "is assessed to be significantly restricting the infant's tongue function, regarding breastfeeding, a frenotomy can be offered at this time". Decision-making should be shared: "this should be a shared decision between the clinician and the family", with accessible follow-up if conservative care is chosen. Because tongue-tie is functional, "the presence of a sublingual frenulum alone… is not an indication for surgical intervention". Release of a restrictive frenulum "can be an effective intervention if maternal nipple and/or areolar pain and/or poor milk transfer cannot be corrected in a timely way through conservative measures".

### Tongue atrophy in Sjögren syndrome patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: autoimmune epithelitis beyond the epithelial cells of salivary glands? [^90763386]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS), an autoimmune epithelitis, bears the risk of evolving to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and most frequently to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) subtype. Based on the observation that pSS patients with MALT present a more atrophic and more intensely fissured tongue, we aimed to semiquantify severity of tongue atrophy and clinically assess lingual appearance in pSS patients with and without MALT, and investigate whether tongue atrophy and fissured appearance could serve as clinical indicators/signs of MALT.

Methods

A blinded complete oral examination was performed in pSS patients with and without MALT. Tongue atrophy was scored using a semiquantified atrophy score. Clinical and laboratory variables were recorded for all patients.

Results

After excluding pSS patients with oral candidiasis, iron deficiency, and megaloblastic anemia, 19 pSS patients with salivary MALT were matched 1:3 for age, sex, and disease duration with 57 pSS patients without MALT. The pSS-MALT patients had increased prevalence of salivary gland enlargement, lymphadenopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, rheumatoid factor positivity, higher focus and Tarpley scores in the minor salivary gland biopsy, and hyposalivation, compared to the pSS non-MALT patients. A significantly higher prevalence of tongue atrophy (68% vs 30%, p = 0.006) and fissured tongue (89% vs 33%, p < 0.001) was observed in the former group. Multivariate analysis showed that fissured tongue appearance, hyposalivation, and lymphadenopathy associate independently with salivary MALT in pSS.

Conclusion

These results suggest that pSS patients with lymphoid malignancy exhibit a more atrophic and more fissured tongue. This particular clinical tongue appearance can serve as an additional clinical sign for salivary MALT lymphoma in pSS patients.

### Irradiation of the normal murine tongue causes upregulation and activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels [^053b2df6]. Radiation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Signal transduction at sensory neurons occurs via transmembrane flux of cations, which is largely governed by the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It is unknown whether TRP channel activation contributes to the pain that accompanies radiation-induced oral mucositis. This study sought to characterize changes in TRP channel expression and function that occur in the locally irradiated tissues and afferent neurons of mice. Female CD-1 mice received single high-dose (27 Gy) tongue irradiation, or sham irradiation. Animals were euthanized either before overt glossitis developed (days 1 and 5 postirradiation), when glossitis was severe (day 11), or after mice had recovered (days 21 and 45). Tongue irradiation caused upregulation of the Trpv1 gene in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons. Other TRP genes (Trpv2, Trpv4, Trpa1, Trpm8) and Gfrα3 (which acts upstream of several TRP channels) were also upregulated in TGs and/or tongue tissue, in response to radiation. Ex vivo calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that the proportions of TG neurons responding to histamine (an activator of TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1), TNF-α (an activator of TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPV4), and capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist), were increased as early as one day after tongue irradiation; these changes persisted for at least 21 days. In a subsequent experiment, we found that genetic deletion of TRPV1 mitigated weight loss (a surrogate marker of pain severity) in mice with severe glossitis. The results intimate that various TRP channels, and TRPV1 in particular, should be explored as analgesic targets for patients experiencing pain after oral irradiation.

### Herpetic geometric glossitis presenting as vegetative plaques in the context of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^419d9c5e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of uncomplicated mucocutaneous lesions can be achieved with oral acyclovir 400 mg every 8 hours, famciclovir 500 mg every 12 hours, or valacyclovir 1 g every 12 hours for 5–10 days. For severe mucocutaneous HSV infections, intravenous acyclovir treatment is recommended initially at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 8 hours; when lesions begin to improve, therapy can be switched to the oral route, and antiviral therapy must be continued until healing of lesions is complete. Patient with HIV who have severe or frequent recurrences are candidates for chronic suppressive therapy, which should be evaluated annually by an infectious disease specialist.

This case report describes the rare clinical presentation of HGG as vegetative plaques that coexisted on a constitutional fissured tongue and highlights the quick favorable response to acyclovir treatment. Also, this case underscores the importance of considering atypical HSV clinical manifestations in the differential diagnosis of oral or anogenital dermatoses that present in patients with HIV.

### Common oral manifestations of systemic disease [^83288d29]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral manifestations of systemic diseases are potential indicators of an array of conditions. Truly the oral cavity is a mirror that reflects and unravels many of the human body's internal secrets. Some of these manifestations are disease specific and help raise a high degree of suspicion for the alert clinician. Because oral manifestations may accompany many systemic diseases, it is essential that these are appropriately recognized to provide correct diagnosis and referral for treatment and patient care. Multiple entities involving the various areas of the oral cavity like the soft palate, hard palate, tongue, gingiva, oral mucosa, the dentition, periodontium, and the salivary gland tissue have been enlisted. Although this article is not all-inclusive, the authors highlight lesions or conditions that are directly related to or are caused by some of the more common systemic diseases, and hope to provide ample insight for physicians, dentists, and clinicians in otolaryngologic practice.

### Acrodermatitis of hallopeau and erosive oral mucositis successfully treated with secukinumab [^08d1461a]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Treatment of acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau is difficult and often disappointing".

"Oral lesions of psoriasis are rare clinical observations".

Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) is characterized by chronic, painful, destructive, and typically disabling disease of the hands and feet. It is considered an uncommon variant of pustular psoriasis that does not readily respond to standard topical or systemic treatments for psoriasis. ACH was first described as a suppurative process that affects the fingertips and hands in 1890 by Hallopeau. If left untreated, the disease process can result in sclerosis and osteolysis, as well as onychodystrophy and anonychia. Numerous topical and systemic treatments have been utilized in the treatment of ACH including phototherapy, topical and systemic vitamin A derivatives, topical vitamin D derivatives, and immunosuppressant therapy.

Possibly due to underreporting, it is not evident in the literature whether oral lesions of psoriasis are associated with ACH. The true incidence of intraoral psoriasis is lacking from the medical literature, mostly because of the inconsistency of histologic patterns and clinical presentation of disease, which ranges from geographic tongue to erosive glossitis, includes painful and nonpainful lesions, and might or might not include cutaneous involvement. Oral lesions might wax and wane, making diagnosis even more difficult to confirm.

### Bilateral loss of taste from a unilateral thalamic infarct [^6b2553c0]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Loss of sense of taste (hypogeusia) involving a part of the tongue can follow acute stroke. We describe a woman with a small right thalamic acute infarct causing bilateral (mainly left-sided) hypogeusia. Her problem remains sufficiently severe to cause distress and nutritional deficit. The anatomical distribution of her problem-cheiro-oral syndrome with concurrent hypogeusia-suggested involvement of adjacent relevant thalamic fibres. We address key considerations in examining taste in research and in practice and discuss issues to address in people with hypogeusia, including swallow deficits, psychological elements of the poststroke condition and nutrition. Dietetic management should include optimising taste stimuli and nutritional support. Introducing more detailed taste assessments into standard practice would likely improve stroke unit care.

Differential Diagnoses

Overall, differential diagnoses have the potential to undermine the reliability of LLMs in diagnosing BMS. Neuropathy is considered a critical differential diagnosis by both ChatGPT and Gemini. Given that BMS may include neuropathic features such as allodynia, its inclusion as a differential diagnosis is naturally justified. On the other hand, it is problematic to include easily distinguishable oral conditions such as geographic tongue, xerostomia, or oral candidiasis in the differential diagnosis. Nutritional deficiencies are frequently mentioned in reviews; however, they rarely considered in the clinical differential diagnosis. Moreover, their symptoms differ significantly from those of BMS; therefore, while they should be recognized as part of the differential diagnosis, they can often be excluded with relative ease.

Other major issues are the ambiguities in differentiating BMS, glossodynia, and oral dysesthesia, highlighting the potential inaccuracies in diagnostic approaches based on LLMs. To assess their differentiation capability, three LLMs were tasked with summarizing the distinctions among BMS, glossodynia, and oral dysesthesia in a tabular format. The results, which were largely similar across the models, are summarized in Table 8 using ChatGPT-generated content. Glossodynia is essentially an older term for BMS, with no fundamental differences in symptoms. In contrast, oral dysesthesia primarily refers to discomfort within the oral cavity, although it can include pain. These findings indicate that all three LLMs misinterpreted the distinctions between BMS, glossodynia and oral dysesthesia.

Table 8
Summary of Differences

In oral medicine practice, critical differential diagnoses frequently include PIFP and oral cenesthopathy. PIFP is characterized by facial pain in the head and neck region, while oral cenesthopathy frequently involves oral discomfort, leading to symptom overlap. The lack of a clear definition for oral cenesthopathy further complicates diagnosis. Thus, it is essential to carefully assess the severity of the patient's pain and their oral discomfort symptoms. In such cases, the Oral Dysesthesia Rating Scale (OralDRS) is considered a useful tool for evaluating oral cenesthopathy symptoms. However, diagnosing overlapping conditions, such as MUOS, remains challenging.

Oral cavity and oropharynx cancer trends and human papillomavirus (HPV) — historical patterns indicate that overall OSCC IRs for most sites have decreased, but the IR for oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma appears to have increased in white men and women, and the IR for OPSCC has increased significantly, particularly in white men. Investigators attribute the dramatic increase in OPSCC to an increased exposure to HPV, and over the past 20 years HPV infection has surpassed tobacco and alcohol as a major risk factor; HPV causes 75% of all OPSCC cases, which is driven by an increase in oral sex. One type in particular, HPV 16, causes most OPSCCs.

B. Symptoms: A wide variety of symptoms have been reported depending on the site of the mass, and they include tongue discomfort, bleeding, pain and difficulty in oral feeding. 386 Roy et al. 387 reported that bleeding from the tongue surface, pain and eating difficulty were alleviated by cauterization.

C. Functions: In most patients who exhibited functional impairment, the lesions were so extended that they were no longer indications for one‐time surgical resection. Large masses located at sites such as the tongue base cause respiratory disturbances, swallowing disorders and difficulty in speech. According to the report by Azizkhan et al. 385 oral intake of normally cooked food became possible in 14, and normal vocalization became possible in eight, of the 21 patients with tongue base lesions. In addition, five of the 17 patients who needed tracheotomy were weaned.

D. Cosmetic improvements: Objective evaluation of cosmetic effects is also difficult.

Azizkhan et al. 385 reported that, of the 20 patients, excluding one with severe deformity who died, deformity of structures around the tongue, such as the mandible and maxilla, was mild in six, moderate in five and severe in nine. There have been a few reports that cosmetic improvements were also observed in patients who showed a reduction of the tongue size by surgical resection, but objective evaluation is insufficient.
Complications

Although the properties of the lesions are unclear in some papers, facial nerve paralysis, vagus nerve paralysis, infection, hematoma, seroma, salivary leakage, ruptured suture and skin flap necrosis have been reported as complications of the facial region. There have also been reports of temporary complications such as pain and hemorrhage.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^576bcd3e]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Physiological roles of vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 exerts its physiological effects through mediating two principal enzymatic pathways i.e. the methylation process of homocysteine to methionine and the conversion of methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA. Vitamin B12 as a co-factor facilitates the methylation of homocysteine to methionine which is later activated into S-adenosyl-methionine that donates its methyl group to methyl acceptors such as myelin, neurotransmitters and membrane phospholipids.

Metabolically significant vitamin B12 deficiency hence will result in disruption of the methylation process and accumulation of intracellular and serum homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been shown to have potentially toxic effects on neurones and the vascular endothelium. This reaction is also essential in the conversion of dietary folate (methyl-tetrahydrofolate) to its active metabolic form, tetrahydrofolate. In another essential enzymatic pathway, vitamin B12 as a co-factor mediates the conversion of methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA. In the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency, this conversion pathway is diminished and an increase in the serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) ensues. This is followed by defective fatty acid synthesis of the neuronal membranes. Vitamin B12 is also essential in the synthesis of monoamines or neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. This synthesis is impaired with vitamin B12 deficiency.

All the above collectively explain the resultant neuro-cognitive or psychiatric manifestations that accompany vitamin B12 deficiency. Axonal demyelination, degeneration and later death are the hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency induced neuronal damage that manifests as severe peripheral or autonomic neuropathy, sub acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, delirium and dementia. Compelling evidence demonstrates that hyperhomocysteinemia is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to its cellular and vasculo-toxic effects.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required in DNA synthesis, cellular repair and normal haemopoesis together with other micronutrients like folate and iron. Vitamin B12 deficiency is classically associated with overt haematological findings like macrocytic red blood cells (mean cell volume [MCV] > 100 fl) with/without anaemia, ovalocytes, hyper segmented white blood cells (i.e. > 5% of neutrophils with ≥ 5 lobes) and pancytopenia. Due to defective cell repair processes, atrophic glossitis, stomatitis and malabsorption due to villi atrophy and mucositis are also common.

### Can tonsillar retractor-induced tongue edema Be a new complication in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy detected by ultrasonography? A prospective, case-controlled, observational study [^fbee2f7e]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in pediatric patients. The tonsillar retractor, which is routinely used during a tonsillectomy, applies high pressure to the patient's tongue and can lead to various complications.

Aims

This study aimed to explore tongue edema induced by the pressure applied by tonsillar retractor, using ultrasonography in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries.

Materials and Methods

Sixty-one patients were included in the study. The tonsillectomy group included 31 patients who underwent tonsillectomy surgery, while the control group included 30 patients who underwent inguinal hernia and circumcision surgery. Submental coronal plane ultrasonography examinations of the tongue were performed twice for each patient. In the tonsillectomy group, the first examination of tongue area (TA 1) was done immediately after intubation but before the placement of tonsillar retractor. The second examination (TA 2) was done at the end of the tonsillectomy surgery after the removal of the tonsillar retractor but before extubation. In the control group, the first examination (TA 1) was done immediately after intubation, whereas the second examination (TA 2) was done at the end of the surgery before extubation. These results were compared with those for the control group.

Results

Groups were similar in terms of demographics and intubation duration. Groups did not significantly differ in terms of TA 1 (P = 0.212), but they significantly differed in terms of TA 2 (P = 0.000). They also significantly differed in terms of tongue edema defined as TA 2 - TA 1 (P = 0.000).

Conclusions and Significance

Tonsillar retractor does cause tongue edema in tonsillectomy surgeries. This tongue edema seems to be a result of the pressure applied by the tonsillar retractor. This study is the first to demonstrate the possible role of ultrasonography examination in determining the tonsillar retractor-induced tongue edema in pediatric patients.

### Bright tongue sign in patients with late-onset Pompe disease [^2c5ce5e1]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

MRI brain review

We reviewed the tongue appearance on T1-weighted MRI in the midsagittal brain. We looked specifically for abnormalities in the shape, size, position and internal structures of the tongue. Date, reason for the study and official radiology read was noted. One of us, a neuroradiologist (EY) reviewed the MRIs blinded of the actual diagnosis. We could not objectively evaluate the size or volume of the tongue because the MRIs were not specifically done to assess the tongue and not all of the tongue could be seen, hence the impression of tongue hyperintensity and atrophy on T1 images was done qualitatively. A tongue not touching the posterior palate was considered atrophic unless the mouth of the patient was open.

### Radiation therapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^e56dc7ca]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Unilateral neck irradiation decision-making in tonsillar/oropharyngeal cancer — soft palate or base of tongue involvement and AJCC-7 N2a–N2b nodes — is characterized by limited criteria. Although the Princess Margaret series used a cutoff of < 1 cm involvement of the soft palate or base of tongue, evidence supports considering unilateral treatment when soft palate involvement is minimal, and patients with base of tongue involvement are not included in recommendations to avoid the contralateral neck. For N2a and N2b disease, no series describes unilateral treatment in an unselected cohort and none defines reproducible criteria, and the data suggest a subset may be appropriate for unilateral care but cannot be defined further. Given this uncertainty, bilateral treatment in select cases such as nodes > 3 cm with gross extranodal spread is appropriate, and Table 8 identifies omission of uninvolved contralateral levels IB, V, and retropharyngeal/high level II/retrostyloid nodes to allow sparing of the contralateral parotid and submandibular glands.

### Bright tongue sign in patients with late-onset Pompe disease [^03b0583b]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, tongue abnormalities on brain MRI in MD patients have not been described. But our findings suggest that tongue abnormalities are probably common in patients with MD type 1. One study evaluated the tongue in 151 FSHD patients and found tongue atrophy and signal abnormalities on brain MRI in 7 patients. Only 1 of our 45 FSHD had a brain MRI and we cannot comment further on this finding. Abnormalities of tongue on brain MRI in ALS patients have been studied. The authors found tongue atrophy in 14 of 16 ALS patients and increased signal intensity in 12 of 16 ALS patients. This is in contrast to our patient population where we found tongue abnormalities in only 5/16 patients. This may be explained by the fact that our patients had brain MRIs earlier in the course of their disease.

Tongue abnormalities on brain MRI are not specific to LOPD and can be seen in other disorders that affect the tongue such as ALS and MD1. Hence, we do not think that analyses of the tongue on imaging will help differentiate between various neuromuscular disorders. However, tongue abnormalities on brain MRI, when evaluating patients for a gait disorder for example, can help orient the physician to the correct diagnosis.

Major limitations of this study are the retrospective nature with a minority of the patient having a brain MRI available for us to review and the lack of objective measure of the tongue size. The small number of patients makes the calculation of frequency, sensitivity and specificity inadequate. The lack of dedicated tongue MRI makes objective measurement of the tongue impossible.

The purpose of this study is not to suggest that patients with neuromuscular disorders should undergo brain MRI to assess for tongue abnormalities and in our practice, we do not routinely order brain MRI for evaluation of a neuromuscular patient. However tongue abnormalities found on brain MRI ordered for other reasons can give clues for the diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder.

### Partial atrophic tongue other than median rhomboid glossitis [^17689ce3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

A group of 23 patients with partial atrophic change of the tongue was examined for candidiasis. All of them reported pain in the tongue on eating hot or spicy food. The intensity of the tongue pain was evaluated before and after treatment using a visual analogue scale. Of the 23 patients, 10 (43.5%) had predisposing factors for candidiasis such as diabetes mellitus and anaemia. In the culture examination, candidal species were isolated in 65.2%, all Candida albicans. Direct cytological examination performed in 10 of the 23 patients revealed fungal pseudohyphae in 8 patients. After antifungal treatment, tongue pain had disappeared or improved markedly in 82.6%. Simultaneously, the filiform papilla of the atrophic site was observed to have begun to regenerate in these patients. Candida infection should be suspected in patients with partial atrophic tongue associated with pain on eating.

### Common tongue conditions in primary care… [^7b881cbc]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

LICHEN PLANUS Lichen planus is an immunologic condition that affects skin or mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth and tongue. Two manifestations of lichen planus have been described: a reticular, white, lacy pattern that affects the buccal mucosa of the tongue and an erosive form that appears as shallow ulcerations. Candida can coexist with lichen planus and requires treatment with an antifungal agent. LINEA ALBA Linea alba appears as a thin white line caused by thickening of the epithelium from recurrent low-grade trauma from chewing. Although usually located on the buccal mucosa, it may occur on the bilateral edges of the tongue. Linea alba is benign, and no therapy is indicated. Tongue Growths GRANULAR CELL TUMORS Granular cell tumors are small, solitary, firm, painless tumors that can occur throughout the body. More than one half of cases occur in the oral cavity, and up to one third involve the dorsum of the tongue.

28 In contrast to squamous cell cancers, which have a rough or ulcerated surface, granular cell tumors have a smooth surface. These tumors are more common after 30 years of age and in women. 28 Biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, malignant transformation occurs requiring wide local excision.
29. LEUKOPLAKIA AND ERYTHROPLAKIA Leukoplakia is a white adherent patch or plaque that can occur on the tongue. Erythroplakia is a similar lesion that is red in appearance. A lesion with a combined white and red speckled appearance is referred to as erythroleukoplakia. MACROGLOSSIA Macroglossia is an abnormal enlargement of the tongue compared with the mouth and jaws. Examination often reveals a scalloping appearance on the lateral margins of the tongue caused by crowding against the teeth. 2 Macroglossia is associated with Down syndrome, hypothyroidism, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, neurofibromatosis, infection, and angioedema or allergic reaction. 2, 49 It is important to consider macroglossia as a sign of an underlying disorder and proceed with focused diagnostic testing, including possible biopsy. Treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder.

### Screening for oral cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^7315fd96]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Screening for oral cancer — screening tests, scope, and adjuncts: The primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity, and an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate; the examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth, and any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy; because oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the posterior third of the tongue), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat, a comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation. Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology, but these screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care non-dental settings, and currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Congenital trilobe tongue associated with cleft palate: a rare anomaly [^74a557be]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Cleft of the palate and congenital anomaly of the tongue is a rare occurrence. A child with the tongue in three segments is being presented for the first time in the literature. This child also had partial cleft palate. The cleft palate was repaired at 7 months of age, and the tongue was reconstructed at 15 months. The tongue reconstruction was done utilizing the three segments of the tongue by an innovative method. This child has been followed up for 6 months with satisfactory results. Congenital abnormalities of the tongue associated with cleft palate may be considered as evidence of close interrelation of embryogenesis of the tongue and palate.

Statistical methods

A TS score in at least one of the four directions of two standard deviations (SD) below the mean of the age- and sex-specific healthy reference group was considered abnormal. Fisher's exact test was used to test differences between patients with and without an abnormal TS for statistical significance in the case of nominal variables (onset site, bulbar symptoms, bulbar signs, sex, gastrostomy, MPT) and Mann–Whitney U in the case of continuous variables (age and time from symptoms to diagnosis). For MPT, patients were allocated to two groups (MPT ≤ 10, MPT > 10 s), because this threshold was found to be of clinical relevance.

Time from diagnosis to death was the primary outcome. The end-of-study date (August 1, 2011) was used for surviving patients and the date of last contact for the one patient who was lost to follow-up. Kaplan–Meier estimates are presented. The log rank test was used to test differences between the two TS groups with regard to time to death.

Univariable proportional hazard model was used to test the differences in survival for each independent variable separately (onset site, bulbar symptoms, bulbar signs, age, sex, MPT, TS, time from symptoms to diagnosis, and gastrostomy). The dependent variable was time to death. Crude hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) are presented. A multivariable proportional hazard model was used with selection procedures to study the independent contribution of a decreased TS. The dependent variable was time to death. All variables in the univariable model with a p < 0.10 were valid for selection: TS, age, and onset site. The adjusted HR with 95% CI of the final model are presented.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0 for windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
