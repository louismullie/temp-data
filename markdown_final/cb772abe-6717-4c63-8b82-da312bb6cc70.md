## Question

as continuous infusion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alteplase is administered as a continuous infusion and how to reconcile that with tenecteplase being a bolus-only alternative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing regimen for alteplase in acute ischemic stroke. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for continuous infusion versus bolus-only administration. Next, I will compare this with tenecteplase's bolus-only approach and the guideline positions. After that, I should review monitoring requirements that hinge on infusion duration. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with references to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the labeled regimen for alteplase in acute ischemic stroke, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from other indications. The FDA label specifies 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) total dose, with 10% given as an initial IV bolus over 1 minute and the remaining 90% infused continuously over 60 minutes, which is the standard of care in stroke protocols and replicated in major guidelines and the original NINDS trial design [^112SuuDc] [^113QxP99] [^116Nn99h].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for the infusion component, because a short half-life would argue for sustained exposure. Alteplase has a very short initial half-life of less than 5 minutes and rapid clearance, so the 60-minute infusion is necessary to maintain therapeutic fibrinolytic exposure; this short half-life and rapid clearance explain why a bolus alone would be insufficient for sustained thrombolysis in stroke, necessitating the continuous infusion component [^11691sXg] [^113QxP99].

> Hold on, I should distinguish this from tenecteplase, which is often described as a bolus-only alternative. Tenecteplase was engineered with a longer half-life and higher fibrin specificity, enabling single-bolus administration at 0.25 mg/kg in stroke; guidelines from ESO and AHA/ASA endorse tenecteplase as a reasonable alternative to alteplase in selected patients, particularly for workflow advantages, but this does not change that alteplase itself remains a bolus plus 60-minute infusion regimen in standard practice [^112pF2QV] [^117JbgHX] [^115pPvJJ].

> I need to check how the infusion duration shapes monitoring, because that's clinically consequential. The AHA/ASA monitoring protocol is explicitly tied to the alteplase infusion: blood pressure and neurologic checks every 15 minutes during and for 2 hours after the infusion, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly until 24 hours, with strict BP control and emergent imaging for any deterioration; this cadence is predicated on the infusion timeline and the early risk window for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [^113239ng] [^1169bovM].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to ensure I'm not missing an exception. The question "as continuous infusion?" could imply uncertainty about whether alteplase is ever given as a continuous infusion; the answer is yes, alteplase is administered as a continuous infusion for the majority of its dose in acute ischemic stroke, with only the initial 10% as a bolus, whereas tenecteplase's bolus-only design is the exception enabled by its pharmacokinetics, not a replacement for alteplase's infusion requirement [^112SuuDc] [^112pF2QV].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, alteplase is administered as a continuous infusion for acute ischemic stroke: 10% IV bolus over 1 minute followed by 90% continuous IV infusion over 60 minutes, a requirement driven by its short half-life and rapid clearance; tenecteplase, by contrast, is given as a single bolus due to its longer half-life and is an accepted alternative in selected patients, but it does not convert alteplase into a bolus-only therapy [^112SuuDc] [^113239ng] [^112pF2QV].

---

Alteplase is administered as a **continuous infusion** for acute ischemic stroke: 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) with 10% as a bolus over 1 minute and the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes [^112SuuDc] [^113239ng]. For myocardial infarction, alteplase is given as an **accelerated infusion** over 90 minutes with a front-loaded bolus [^111Duyts] [^112SuuDc]. For pulmonary embolism, alteplase is infused over 2 hours [^112SuuDc]. Tenecteplase, an alternative thrombolytic, is given as a single bolus without continuous infusion [^112pF2QV] [^115pPvJJ].

---

## Clinical indications for continuous infusion of alteplase

Alteplase is indicated for **continuous infusion** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)**: 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg), 10% as a bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes [^112SuuDc] [^113239ng].

- **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**: accelerated infusion over 90 minutes with a front-loaded bolus [^111Duyts] [^112SuuDc].

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: 100 mg infused over 2 hours [^112SuuDc].

---

## Recommended dosing and infusion protocols

| **Clinical indication** | **Dose** | **Infusion protocol** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute ischemic stroke | 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) | - 10% bolus over 1 minute <br/> - Remainder over 60 minutes [^112SuuDc] [^113239ng] |
| Acute myocardial infarction | Weight-based (max 100 mg) | Accelerated infusion over 90 minutes with front-loaded bolus [^111Duyts] [^112SuuDc] |
| Pulmonary embolism | 100 mg | Infuse over 2 hours [^112SuuDc] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

Continuous infusion of alteplase has been extensively studied and demonstrates significant clinical benefits:

- **Acute ischemic stroke**: Improves functional outcomes and reduces disability when administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset [^114Fnrqw] [^113oLZE9].

- **Acute myocardial infarction**: Reduces mortality and preserves myocardial function when administered promptly [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Rapidly improves hemodynamic stability and reduces right ventricular strain [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Continuous infusion of alteplase carries a risk of bleeding complications, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) [^1169bovM]. Close monitoring is essential:

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Every 15 minutes during infusion, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly until 24 hours post-infusion [^113239ng].

- **Neurological assessments**: Frequent neurological checks to detect early signs of sICH or other complications [^113239ng].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regular assessment of coagulation parameters and fibrinogen levels to detect coagulopathy [^113QxP99].

---

## Comparison with alternative thrombolytic agents

Tenecteplase, a genetically modified variant of alteplase, offers several advantages over alteplase, including **higher fibrin specificity**, **resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1**, and a **longer half-life**, allowing single-bolus administration without continuous infusion [^115SztLC] [^115pPvJJ]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that tenecteplase is **non-inferior to alteplase** in acute ischemic stroke, with similar or improved recanalization rates and comparable safety profiles [^112pF2QV] [^116AUXPm].

---

## Practical considerations and challenges

Continuous infusion of alteplase requires careful preparation, administration, and monitoring. Challenges include:

- **Infusion pumps**: Reliable infusion pumps and equipment are necessary to ensure accurate dosing [^notfound].

- **Staffing**: Continuous monitoring by trained healthcare professionals is essential [^113239ng].

- **Patient transfer**: Continuous infusion complicates inter-hospital transfers, requiring specialized transport protocols [^114d2wzp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) **recommend continuous infusion of alteplase** for acute ischemic stroke, with tenecteplase as an alternative in selected patients [^113239ng] [^112pF2QV].

---

Continuous infusion of alteplase is a **well-established and effective** method of administration for acute ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. It requires careful monitoring and specialized equipment, but offers significant clinical benefits. Tenecteplase, administered as a single bolus, is a promising alternative that may simplify administration and improve workflow in certain clinical settings [^115pPvJJ].

Accelerated Infusion in AMI Patients

Accelerated infusion of Activase was studied in an international, multi-center trial that randomized 41,021 patients with AMI to four thrombolytic regimens (Study 3). Entry criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of treatment and ST-segment elevation of ECG. The four treatment regimens included accelerated infusion of Activase (≤ 100 mg over 90 minutes) plus intravenous (IV) heparin (n = 10,396); Streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes) plus IV heparin (SK [IV], n = 10,410); Streptokinase plus subcutaneous (SQ) heparin (SK [SQ] n = 9841). A fourth regimen combined Activase and Streptokinase (n = 10,374). All patients received 160 mg chewable aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 160–325 mg daily. Bolus IV heparin 5000 U was initiated as soon as possible, followed by a 1000 U/hour continuous IV infusion for at least 48 hours; subsequent heparin therapy was at the physician's discretion. Heparin SQ 12,500 U was administered 4 hours after initiation of SK therapy, followed by 12,500 U twice daily for 7 days or until discharge, whichever came first. Many of the patients randomized to receive SQ heparin received some IV heparin, usually in response to recurrent chest pain and/or the need for a medical procedure. Some received IV heparin on arrival to the emergency room prior to enrollment and randomization.

Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) diagnosis and detection — sICH attributed to alteplase occurs within 36 h of infusion, with only half diagnosed by 5–10 h; extending neurological and cardiovascular monitoring every 30 min from 8 h to 12 h may enable earlier diagnosis but requires larger prospective assessment, and in severe strokes a lower threshold for emergent repeat imaging may be considered for patients with high NIHSS scores (eg, NIHSS score ≥ 12).

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of phase III randomised trials [^115pPvJJ]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second-leading cause of death globally and ischaemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all incident strokes in 2019. In patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis is the standard of care within 4.5 hours time window. Tenecteplase (TNK) or its similar drug recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator were bioengineered with mutations at three genetic loci on the bases of the alteplase molecule. Based on its prolonged half-life and improved specificity for fibrinolysis compared with alteplase, TNK can be administered in a single bolus and does not require continuous infusion. This advantage of ease of use facilitates subsequent endovascular treatment and simplifies the transfer from drip and ship to bolus and ship of AIS patients when needed.

Monitoring duration considerations based on sICH diagnosis timing after alteplase: Retrospective studies reported median times from alteplase infusion to sICH ranging from 5 to 10 hours. In one study of 128 alteplase-treated patients, nearly 80% with sICH were diagnosed > 2 hours after infusion and the median time to sICH diagnosis was nearly 8 hours. Based on these data, treating practitioners may consider extending intensive (every 30 minutes) neurological and cardiovascular monitoring to 12 hours from the currently recommended 8 hours, particularly in patients at high risk for sICH.

14.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)

Two placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in patients with AIS. Both studies enrolled patients with measurable neurological deficit who could complete screening and begin study treatment within 3 hours from symptom onset. A cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed prior to treatment to rule out the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Blood pressure was actively controlled (185/110 mm Hg or lower) for 24 hours.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either 0.9 mg/kg Activase (maximum of 90 mg) or placebo. Activase was administered as a 10% initial IV bolus over 1 minute followed by continuous IV infusion of the remainder over 60 minutes. Study treatment was initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results in patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants and/or heparin and was discontinued if the pretreatment prothrombin time (PT) was greater than 15 seconds or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was elevated. Patients with prior aspirin use were included. Administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents was prohibited for the first 24 hours following symptom onset.

Study 1 (n = 291) evaluated neurological improvement at 24 hours after stroke onset. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a 4 point or greater improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or complete recovery (NIHSS score of 0), was not significantly different between treatment groups. A prespecified secondary analysis suggested improved 3-month outcome associated with Activase treatment using the following stroke assessment scales: Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, and the NIHSS.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — IV alteplase administration and monitoring are as follows: Infuse 0.9 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg) over 60 min, with 10% of the dose given as a bolus over 1 min. Admit the patient to an intensive care or stroke unit for monitoring. If the patient develops severe headache, acute hypertension, nausea, or vomiting or has a worsening neurological examination, discontinue the infusion (if IV alteplase is being administered) and obtain emergency head CT scan. Measure blood pressure (BP) and perform neurological assessments every 15 min during and after IV alteplase infusion for 2 h, then every 30 min for 6 h, then hourly until 24 h after IV alteplase treatment. Increase the frequency of BP measurements if SBP is > 180 mm Hg or if DBP is > 105 mm Hg; administer antihypertensive medications to maintain BP at or below these levels. Delay placement of nasogastric tubes, indwelling bladder catheters, or intra-arterial pressure catheters if the patient can be safely managed without them. Obtain a follow-up CT or MRI scan at 24 h after IV alteplase before starting anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

### Alteplase (cathflo Activase) [^11691sXg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Alteplase is an enzyme (serine protease) that has the property of fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. Alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin, thereby initiating local fibrinolysis (1).

In patients with acute myocardial infarction administered 100 mg of Activase as an accelerated intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, plasma clearance occurred with an initial half‑life of less than 5 minutes and a terminal half‑life of 72 minutes. Clearance is mediated primarily by the liver (2).

When Cathflo Activase is administered for restoration of function to central venous access devices according to the instructions in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, circulating plasma levels of Alteplase are not expected to reach pharmacologic concentrations. If a 2 mg dose of Alteplase were administered by bolus injection directly into the systemic circulation (rather than instilled into the catheter), the concentration of circulating Alteplase would be expected to return to endogenous circulating levels of 5–10 ng/mL within 30 minutes (1).

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous alteplase, timing, ACEP 2015 guidelines recommend to administer IV alteplase with a goal to improve functional outcomes in selected patients with AIS within 3 hours after symptom onset at institutions where systems are in place to safely administer the medication. Take the increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage into consideration when deciding whether to administer IV alteplase in patients with AIS.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^112pF2QV]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, ESO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as an alternative to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients with AIS of < 4.5 hours duration eligible for IV thrombolysis.
Consider preferring tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in these patients in light of safety and efficacy data and because tenecteplase can be administered with a single bolus rather than a 1-hour infusion.
Do not use tenecteplase at a dose of 0.40 mg/kg.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^112SuuDc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke

Administer Activase as soon as possible but within 3 hours after onset of symptoms.

The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg (not to exceed 90 mg total dose), with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial intravenous bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes.

During and following Activase administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, frequently monitor and control blood pressure.

In patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants or heparin, Activase treatment can be initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results. Discontinue Activase if the pretreatment International Normalized Ratio (INR) is greater than 1.7 or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

2.2 Acute Myocardial Infarction

Administer Activase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.

The recommended total doses for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on patient weight, not to exceed 100 mg, regardless of the selected administration regimen (accelerated or 3 hour, described below).

There are two Activase dose regimens (accelerated and 3-hour) for use in the management of AMI; there are no controlled studies to compare clinical outcomes with these regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Accelerated Infusion

The recommended accelerated infusion dose consists of an IV bolus [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)] followed by an IV infusion as set forth in Table 1.

The safety and efficacy of accelerated infusion of Activase have only been investigated with concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

3-Hour Infusion

For patients weighing ≥ 65 kg, the recommended dose is 100 mg administered as 60 mg in the first hour (6–10 mg administered as a bolus), 20 mg over the second hour, and 20 mg over the third hour. For smaller patients (< 65 kg), a dose of 1.25 mg/kg administered over 3 hours may be used. Weight-based doses are shown in Table 2.

2.3 Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

The recommended dose is 100 mg administered by IV infusion over 2 hours.

Institute parenteral anticoagulation near the end of or immediately following the Activase infusion when the partial thromboplastin time or thrombin time returns to twice normal or less.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^112BhMhM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of alteplase IV (also known as Activase, Cathflo Activase):

- **Bleeding**: use extreme caution with alteplase, as it may cause significant, sometimes fatal bleeding, particularly at puncture sites. Avoid intramuscular injections, minimize trauma, and limit venipunctures. For necessary arterial punctures, use an upper extremity vessel, apply manual compression for 30 minutes, and monitor closely. Discontinue alteplase immediately if serious bleeding occurs and provide appropriate treatment. Monitor for delayed hemorrhage, especially in patients on anticoagulants.
- **Fat embolism**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as rare but potentially fatal cholesterol embolism has been reported with alteplase, presenting with systemic ischemic symptoms and often associated with vascular procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (e.g., laryngeal edema, rash, shock) and angioedema, have been reported with alteplase, with rare fatal outcomes. Angioedema is more likely in patients on ACE inhibitors. Monitor closely during and up to 2 hours post-infusion, and discontinue alteplase immediately if reactions occur, providing appropriate treatment.
- **Thromboembolism**: use extreme caution in patients at high risk for left heart thrombus, such as those with MS or AF.

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Tenecteplase

Cross‐linked fibrin proteins, as one of the main components of a thrombus, can be dissolved through the process of fibrinolysis. Vascular endothelial cells secrete tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), which has the ability to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Subsequently, plasmin enzymatically cleaves the fibrin skeleton, leading to the dissolution of the thrombus and the recanalization of the occluded vessel.

Tenecteplase is a genetically engineered mutant tissue plasminogen activator that possesses 3 sites of amino acid replacements as compared with alteplaseThese structural alterations endow tenecteplase with advantages in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (Figure 1). Tenecteplase exhibits a more prolonged half‐life and slower plasma clearance, facilitating its administration as a single bolus instead of a bolus accompanied by continuous infusion, which makes it better for interhospital transfers. Furthermore, tenecteplase has a 14‐fold increase in fibrin specificity and an 80‐fold higher resistance to PAI‐1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1) compared with alteplase. Theoretically, tenecteplase should have a greater rate of recanalization and a lower risk of hemorrhagic events when compared with alteplase. When considering these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, tenecteplase is a reasonable and promising alternative to alteplase.

### Reteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours (RAISE): rationale and design of a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^1139KPC9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rationale

Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) represents the primary reperfusion therapy for early recanalisation of acute ischaemic stroke, preserving the cerebral ischaemic penumbra and enhancing clinical outcomes. The widespread utilisation of thrombolytics continues to be in high clinical demand. Reteplase (r-PA) and tenecteplase are third generation of alternative thrombolytic agents for acute myocardial infarction. Tenecteplase was non-inferior to rt-PA in patients with acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset. To date, there is a lack of definitive clinical trials comparing r-PA with rt-PA in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Reteplase is a non-glycosylated variant of rt-PA, characterised by a longer half-life that facilitates double-bolus administration with a fixed dosage instead of infusion based on body weight in kilogram. Theoretically, the reduction in fibrin specificity can enhance thrombolysis, meanwhile, it may also increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, it is crucial to determine the appropriate dosage of r-PA for patients with acute ischaemic stroke in order to achieve an optimal benefit-risk ratio.

A multi-centre, prospective, randomised controlled, open-label, blinded-endpoint, dose-finding, phase 2 clinical trial of r-PA has suggested that the rate of death and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) among 12 mg+12 mg of r-PA, 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA were similar in patients with acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset in China. Although there was a slightly higher incidence of extracranial bleeding (without statistically significant differences) in patients treated with 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA compared to those treated with 12 mg+12 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA, the group receiving 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA had a numerically superior proportion of excellent functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale 0–1) when compared with the groups receiving 12 mg+ 12 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA. The recommended dosage of r-PA for patients with acute myocardial infarction is 18mg+18 mg.

### Comparison of intermittent versus continuous infusion antihypertensives in acute ischemic stroke [^111SHcb3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to blood pressure (BP) management in acute ischemic stroke remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if an intermittent (labetalol or hydralazine) or continuous infusion (nicardipine or clevidipine) antihypertensive strategy facilitated timelier alteplase administration.

Methods

Patients ≥ 18 years who presented to the emergency department (ED) between September 1, 2013 and August 31, 2020, received alteplase for acute ischemic stroke, and required BP management with an intravenous antihypertensive were included in this multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria were initial administration of a non-study antihypertensive, initial study antihypertensive administration > 2 hours prior to or any time following alteplase, or receipt of both an intermittent and continuous infusion antihypertensive prior to alteplase. The primary endpoint was the time from ED presentation to alteplase administration.

Results

During the study period, 122 patients received an intermittent antihypertensive and 57 patients received a continuous infusion antihypertensive. The median door-to-needle time was 53 minutes for patients who received an intermittent antihypertensive compared to 57 minutes for those who received a continuous infusion antihypertensive (p = 0.17). Secondarily, the proportion of patients who achieved the BP target < 185/110 mmHg within 15 minutes of initial antihypertensive administration and the incidence of adverse events were similar between treatment groups. In cost analysis, intermittent antihypertensives were less expensive than continuous infusion antihypertensives ($2.20 vs. $71.40).

Conclusions

Among patients with acute ischemic stroke and uncontrolled BP, the initial use of an intermittent or continuous infusion antihypertensive did not significantly impact the time to alteplase administration.

### Treatment and outcome of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112o4gth]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association scientific statement — conclusions and future directions on symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after systemic thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke — state that symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is an uncommon but severe complication; mechanisms by which alteplase and other thrombolytics lead to sICH are likely mediated by coagulopathy, reperfusion injury, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Despite improved clinical algorithms, a small proportion of patients treated with alteplase within guidelines will develop sICH, and correction of the coagulopathy after alteplase has remained the mainstay of treatment, but no specific agent has been shown to be most effective. Data from other disease states raise the possibility that certain agents not routinely used may be effective and they require further study; treatment to correct coagulopathy will likely require early diagnosis before catastrophic expansion occurs and early administration of cryoprecipitate and other agents that can be rapidly administered. Additional treatment modalities that require further research include neurosurgical evacuation of the hematoma. There is a significant avenue of research indicating the impact of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in the pathogenesis of sICH, although these data have been limited mostly to rodent models, and further research is required to establish treatments aimed at maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Whether other thrombolytics besides alteplase will be as effective in clinical trials with less impact on the coagulation cascade and blood-brain barrier remains to be established, and the suggestions from this statement are summarized in Table 5.

Prevention of hematoma expansion in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) — Healthcare providers should weigh ischemic risk against hemorrhage severity and expansion risk to set blood pressure goals; with incomplete recanalization, higher blood pressure targets may be necessary to maintain flow and reduce infarct growth, whereas with full recanalization stricter blood pressure control may be reasonable, though safety and efficacy require further investigation.

IV thrombolysis — alteplase use, time windows, required information, and labeling. IV administration of alteplase (Activase; formerly known as tissue plasminogen activator) was the first acute stroke treatment demonstrated to improve patients' neurologic function and remains first-line therapy, even for likely endovascular treatment candidates, for selected patients presenting within 3 or 4.5 hours from stroke onset or the time that the patient was last known to be well. When capacity or surrogates are present, patients should be quickly but clearly informed about the stroke diagnosis and rationale for thrombolytic therapy, the patient's prospects for achieving a good functional outcome with and without treatment, and risks of treatment, including intracerebral hemorrhage and angioedema. Labeling differs by time window: Alteplase treatment within the 3-hour window is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), whereas treatment of selected patients within the 4.5-hour window is scientifically recommended but remains off-label, which the treating neurologist should discuss, when possible, with the patient or surrogate.

### Clinical policy: use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^116Nn99h]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

NINDS tPA Stroke Study — acute ischemic stroke dosing and outcomes show that patients "were randomized 1:1 to placebo versus IV treatment with 0.9 mg/kg of the human recombinant tPA alteplase, with 10% of the total dose administered as a bolus and the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes (maximum dose 90 mg)", with randomization stratified by treatment time "(0 to 90 minutes and 91 to 180 minutes)". Early clinical improvement (part I) showed "no difference in early clinical improvement in the tPA group compared with the placebo group (relative risk 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 1.6; p = 0.21)", whereas at 3 months (part II) "The odds ratio (OR) for a favorable outcome in the tPA group, defined as minimal or no disability at 90 days, was 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.6; p = 0.008)". Across scales, "A favorable outcome for the tPA group was observed on each of the 4 assessment scales (P = 0.02 to .03), with absolute percentage differences between tPA and placebo ranging from 11% to 13%", exemplified by a modified Rankin Scale "score outcome of 0 or 1… in 39% of tPA-treated patients versus 26% of placebo-treated patients". The global statistic showed "a 12% absolute increase" with "a number needed to treat of 8.3", and "8.3 patients would need to be treated", with reanalysis suggesting the number needed to treat "may be as low as 3.6". Safety and mortality included "Mortality was similar in both groups (17% for tPA versus 21% for placebo; p = 0.30)" but "an increase in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage… during the first 36 hours (6% versus 0.6% in the placebo group; P < .001)", and hemorrhages that were "fatal (45%)".

### Role of intravenous thrombolytics prior to endovascular thrombectomy [^111QscBe]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke have evolved in parallel. However, the best approach to combine these reperfusion therapies in patients eligible for both strategies remains uncertain. Initial randomized trials of endovascular thrombectomy included administration of intravenous thrombolytics to all eligible patients. However, whether that is of net benefit has been questioned and parallels drawn with treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, where intravenous thrombolytics are only given if first medical contact to percutaneous intervention is expected to be > 90 minutes. Six randomized trials of a direct thrombectomy approach versus intravenous thrombolytics followed by endovascular thrombectomy have now reported their results. With exception of a minority of patients in one trial, the trials all used alteplase rather than potentially more effective tenecteplase. This review examines the current state of evidence and implications for clinical practice. Importantly, these trials only apply to patients who present to a hospital with immediate access to endovascular thrombectomy and are not relevant to patients who receive thrombolytic and are then transferred to an endovascular-capable hospital. Although 2 of the 6 randomized trials met their prespecified noninferiority margin, these margins were large compared with the absolute benefit of alteplase. Overall, functional outcome was similar, with slight trends favoring bridging thrombolytics and a significant increase in final reperfusion. Symptomatic hemorrhage was increased by ≈1.8% in the bridging group but death was nonsignificantly lower. The workflow in direct thrombectomy trials involved delaying thrombolytic administration until eligibility for thrombectomy and the trials was established and randomization completed. This reduced the time available for thrombolytics to occur prethrombectomy compared with standard practice. We conclude that, pending individual-patient data meta-analyses, intravenous thrombolytics retain an important role alongside endovascular thrombectomy. Further efforts to accelerate and enhance reperfusion with thrombolytics and perform individual patient-level pooled subgroup analyses are warranted.

ASSENT-2

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) study was an international, randomized, double-blind trial that compared 30-day mortality rates in 16,949 patients assigned to receive an IV bolus dose of TNKase or an accelerated infusion of Activase®(alteplase). Eligibility criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of randomization and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients were to be excluded from the trial if they received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the previous 12 hours. TNKase was dosed using actual or estimated weight in a weight-tiered fashion as described in Dosage and Administration (2.1). All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤ 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing > 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. Heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged for the first 24 hours following randomization. The results of the primary endpoint (30-day mortality rates with non-parametric adjustment for the covariates of age, Killip class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and infarct location) along with selected other 30-day endpoints are shown in Table 2.

Rates of mortality and the combined endpoint of death or stroke among pre-specified subgroups, including age, gender, time to treatment, infarct location, and history of previous myocardial infarction, demonstrate consistent relative risks across these subgroups. There was insufficient enrollment of non-Caucasian patients to draw any conclusions regarding relative efficacy in racial subsets.

Rates of in-hospital procedures, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent placement, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, were similar between the TNKase and Activase (alteplase) groups.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Three clinical studies were performed in patients with improperly functioning central venous access devices (CVADs).

A placebo‑controlled, double‑blind, randomized trial (Trial 1) and a larger open‑label trial (Trial 2) investigated the use of Alteplase in predominately adult patients who had an indwelling CVAD for administration of chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition, or long‑term administration of antibiotics or other medications. Both studies enrolled patients whose catheters were not functioning (defined as the inability to withdraw at least 3 mL of blood from the device) but had the ability to instill the necessary volume of study drug. Patients with hemodialysis catheters or a known mechanical occlusion were excluded from both studies. Also excluded were patients considered at high risk for bleeding or embolization (see PRECAUTIONS, Bleeding), as well as patients who were younger than 2 years old or weighed less than 10 kg. Restoration of function was assessed by successful withdrawal of 3 mL of blood and infusion of 5 mL of saline through the catheter.

Trial 1 tested the efficacy of a 2 mg/2 mL Alteplase dose in restoring function to occluded catheters in 150 patients with catheter occlusion up to 24 hours in duration. Patients were randomized to receive either Alteplase or placebo instilled into the lumen of the catheter, and catheter function was assessed at 120 minutes. Restoration of function was assessed by successful withdrawal of 3 mL of blood and infusion of 5 mL of saline through the catheter. All patients whose catheters did not meet these criteria were then administered Alteplase, until function was restored or each patient had received up to two active doses. After the initial dose of study agent, 51 (67%) of 76 patients randomized to Alteplase and 12 (16%) of 74 patients randomized to placebo had catheter function restored. This resulted in a treatment‑associated difference of 51% (95% CI is 37% to 64%). A total of 112 (88%) of 127 Alteplase‑treated patients had restored function after up to two doses.

The study ECASS III was published by Hacke W and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the ECASS III study, the trial question was: what is the effect of intravenous alteplase administered after 3 to 4.5 hours in patients with AIS? In the ECASS III study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ECASS III study, the population was: 821 patients (326 female, 495 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ischemic stroke. The key exclusion criteria were ICH or major ischemic infarction as detected on CT scan, seizure at the onset of stroke, stroke or serious head trauma within the previous 3 months, OAC treatment, or increased risk of bleeding. In the ECASS III study, the interventions were: n = 418 alteplase (intravenous dose of 0.9 mg/kg of body weight) n = 403 placebo (identical placebo IV). In the ECASS III study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mRS score < 2 (52.4% vs. 45.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.76). In the ECASS III study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in mortality (7.7% vs. 8.4%, p = 0.68) and other serious adverse events. significant differences in any ICH (27.0% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.001) and symptomatic ICH (2.4% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.008). In the ECASS III study, the conclusion was: in patients with ischemic stroke, alteplase was superior to placebo with respect to mRS score < 2.

### Progress in intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke [^116FcSUw]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Nearly 20 years later, it remains the only approved treatment, despite limitations in both efficacy and safety. With a growing capacity for stroke treatment worldwide, physicians need to understand where we have come from and what the future of stroke treatment might be.

Objective

To present a historical prospective as well as current trends in thrombolytic therapy, focusing on characteristics of drugs that have worked and clinical trials that are moving the field forward.

Evidence Review

Sources are published pivotal clinical trials; seminal articles on physiology, pharmacology, and neuroimanging; and listings from clinical trial registries.

Findings

The slow progress in thrombolysis for acute stroke has been multifactorial. A focus on extending the time window for alteplase beyond 4.5 hours has encumbered substantial resources in the field for many years, yet these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. New drug development has also been slow. Several drugs have failed in clinical trials and currently only tenecteplase remains to be tested as a potential alternative to alteplase. The parallel pursuit for catheter-based interventional revascularization in acute stroke, which appears to be successful, has shifted emphasis away from pharmacologically based studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although the field of acute thrombolysis has been making progress slowly for many years, advances in neuroimaging and new clinical trials that combine thrombolytics with other pharmacological and interventional techniques are beginning to gain momentum once again. The emergence of new approaches based largely on combination therapy strategies has reset a course to advance thrombolytic treatment for acute stroke and promises to improve outcomes in acute stroke in the near future.

### Review, historical context, and clarifications of the NINDS rt-PA stroke trials exclusion criteria: part 1: rapidly improving stroke symptoms [^112TTmty]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Since Food and Drug Administration approval of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) for treatment of acute ischemic stroke in 1996, it has become clear that several criteria used for exclusion from therapy were not based on actual data or operationally defined for use in clinical practice. All eligibility criteria from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) recombinant tPA Stroke Study were adopted within the alteplase package insert as contraindications/warnings. Many clinicians have expressed the need for clarification and better definition of these treatment criteria.

Methods

A group of investigators who also practice as stroke physicians convened a collaborative endeavor to work toward developing more clinically meaningful and consensus-driven exclusion criteria for intravenous tPA. The first of these exclusion criteria chosen was rapidly improving stroke symptoms (RISS). We reviewed and clarified the historical context and intention with the original investigators, held e-mail discussions, convened an in-person RISS Summit, and obtained the understanding of experienced stroke physicians broadly.

Results

Historically, the intent of this exclusion criterion within the NINDS recombinant tPA Stroke Trial was to avoid treatment of transient ischemic attacks-who would have recovered completely without treatment. There was unanimous consensus that, in the absence of other contraindications, patients who experience improvement of any degree, but have a persisting neurological deficit that is potentially disabling, should be treated with intravenous tPA. This statement is supported from the methods established for the original NINDS trial, on the basis of detailed discussions and interviews with the former NINDS trialists. It was agreed that improvement should only be monitored for the extent of time needed to prepare and administer the intravenous tPA bolus/infusion. An explicit operational definition of RISS was developed by consensus to guide future decision making in acute stroke. There was unanimous agreement that all neurological deficits present at the time of the treatment decision should be considered in the context of individual risk and benefit, as well as the patient's baseline functional status.

Conclusions

A structured framework and quantitative approach toward defining RISS emerged through expert opinion and consensus. The term, RISS, should be reserved for those who improve to a mild deficit, specifically one which is perceived to be nondisabling. This is recommended to guide decision making on intravenous tPA eligibility going forward, including the design of future studies. An additional study of patients with rapid improvement to nonmild deficits is not justified because these patients should be treated.

### Tenecteplase thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke [^116AUXPm]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase is a fibrinolytic drug with higher fibrin specificity and longer half-life than the standard stroke thrombolytic, alteplase, permitting the convenience of single bolus administration. Tenecteplase, at 0.5 mg/kg, has regulatory approval to treat ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, for which it has equivalent 30-day mortality and fewer systemic hemorrhages. Investigated as a thrombolytic for ischemic stroke over the past 15 years, tenecteplase is currently being studied in several phase 3 trials. Based on a systematic literature search, we provide a qualitative synthesis of published stroke clinical trials of tenecteplase that (1) performed randomized comparisons with alteplase, (2) compared different doses of tenecteplase, or (3) provided unique quantitative meta-analyses. Four phase 2 and one phase 3 study performed randomized comparisons with alteplase. These and other phase 2 studies compared different tenecteplase doses and effects on early outcomes of recanalization, reperfusion, and substantial neurological improvement, as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 3-month disability on the modified Rankin Scale. Although no single trial prospectively demonstrated superiority or noninferiority of tenecteplase on clinical outcome, meta-analyses of these trials (1585 patients randomized) point to tenecteplase superiority in recanalization of large vessel occlusions and noninferiority in disability-free 3-month outcome, without increases in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or mortality. Doses of 0.25 and 0.4 mg/kg have been tested, but no advantage of the higher dose has been suggested by the results. Current clinical practice guidelines for stroke include intravenous tenecteplase at either dose as a second-tier option, with the 0.25 mg/kg dose recommended for large vessel occlusions, based on a phase 2 trial that demonstrated superior recanalization and improved 3-month outcome relative to alteplase. Ongoing randomized phase 3 trials may better define the comparative risks and benefits of tenecteplase and alteplase for stroke thrombolysis and answer questions of tenecteplase efficacy in the > 4.5-hour time window, in wake-up stroke, and in combination with endovascular thrombectomy.

Time and Economic Benefits

The ease of administering tenecteplase, which involves a bolus‐administered medication that does not require infusion monitoring during intrahospital or interhospital transfer, may aid in decreasing dosing errors, as well as enhancing patient workflow and potentially improving outcomes. The completed phase 2 TASTE‐A (Comparison of Tenecteplase With Alteplase for the Early Treatment of Ischemic Stroke in the Melbourne Mobile Stroke Unit) trialin 5 tertiary hospitals in Melbourne aimed to test the hypothesis that tenecteplase administered in a mobile stroke unit (MSU) would result in superior reperfusion at hospital arrival, when compared with alteplase. In this study, 104 adult patients with ischemic stroke who were eligible for thrombolytic treatment were randomly allocated in the MSU to receive, within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, either standard‐of‐care alteplase (n = 49) or 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase (n = 55), before being transported to the hospital for ongoing care. Treatment with tenecteplase on the MSU in Melbourne resulted in a superior rate of volume on the posttreatment perfusion lesion on arrival at the hospital assessed by CT‐perfusion imaging compared with alteplase (median, 12 mL [interquartile range, 3–28]) versus (35 mL; adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.37–0.81]; P = 0.0030), and no safety concerns were noted. Notably, compared with patients allocated to alteplase, those allocated to tenecteplase had a shorter median time between MSU CT imaging and thrombolysis initiation and time from MSU arrival to thrombolytic treatment. This trial provides evidence to support the use of tenecteplase and MSUs in an optimal model of stroke care. This is the first trial to provide evidence of tenecteplase use in the prehospital setting. However, the phase 2 trial was underpowered to show a difference in 3‐month outcomes between tenecteplase and alteplase. Phase 3 randomized clinical trials comparing ultra‐early tenecteplase use with alteplase are ongoing to investigate the long‐term benefit (ACTRN12613000243718, NCT03889249).

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous alteplase, bleeding risk, AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV alteplase in patients with a recent or active history of menorrhagia without clinically significant anemia or hypotension because the potential benefits of IV alteplase probably outweigh the risks of serious bleeding.

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^114ZJB37]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Acute ischemic stroke is a neurological disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is a major health problem, especially in Asia, where ≈60% of the world's population resides, and where many countries face challenges in the delivery and organization of stroke care. The World Health Organization estimates that low‐ and middle‐income countries account for 86% of stroke‐related deaths and 89% of disability‐adjusted life‐years worldwide.

Tenecteplase, a third‐generation thrombolytic, is a genetically modified tissue plasminogen activator. The genetic point mutations have resulted in tenecteplase having higher fibrin specificity, resistance to degradation by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and a longer plasma half‐life compared with alteplase. The longer half‐life allows for a fast bolus injection of tenecteplase, whereas alteplase, a second‐generation thrombolytic, is administered over an hour as an infusion. Several clinical and real‐world observational studies have established the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke. These studies have demonstrated that tenecteplase is associated with either similar or reduced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) when compared with alteplase, and it may also lead to higher early recanalization rates in patients with large vessel occlusion. As a result, tenecteplase is being widely used off‐label for stroke and has replaced alteplase as the thrombolytic of choice in different health care systems across the world.

### Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and ischemic stroke: focused update of 2010 clinical practice advisory from the American academy of emergency medicine [^1153vHRd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke treatment is a continuum that begins with the rapid identification of symptoms and treatment with transition to successful rehabilitation. Therapies for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) may vary based on anatomic location, interval from symptom onset, and coexisting health conditions. Successful therapy requires a seamless systematic approach with coordination from prehospital environment through acute management at medical facilities to disposition and long-term care of the patient. The emergency physician must balance the benefits and risks of alteplase recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for AIS management.

Objective

We review the recent medical literature on the topic of AIS and assess intravenous rtPA for the following questions: 1) is there any applicable, new, high-quality evidence that the benefits of intravenous rtPA are justified in light of the harms associated with it, and 2) if so, does the evidence clarify which patients, if any, are most likely to benefit from the treatment.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search from January 2010 to October 2016 and limited to human studies written in English for articles with keywords of cerebrovascular accident and (thromboly* OR alteplase). Guideline statements and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Studies targeting differences between specific populations (males vs. females) were excluded. Studies identified then underwent a structured review from which results could be evaluated.

Results

Three hundred twenty-two papers on thrombolytic use were screened and nine appropriate articles were rigorously reviewed and recommendations given.

Conclusions

No new studies published between 2010 and 2016 meaningfully reduced uncertainty regarding our understanding of the benefits and harms of intravenous rtPA for AIS. Discussions regarding benefit and harm should occur for patients, and risk prediction scores may facilitate the conversation.

### Treatment and outcome of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114ojcYE]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification — stroke severity and multivariable scoring. Stroke severity as assessed by NIHSS score is one of the factors most robustly associated with sICH risk. These limitations have motivated attempts to create scoring systems integrating multiple factors to better predict risk of sICH in individual patients, and at least 7 such prediction scores have been proposed (Table 3). Validation studies comparing these scores in different populations of alteplase-treated patients have shown similar predictive values for the various scores (Table 3), and although these scores generally are effective at estimating the incremental sICH risk facing individual patients, the upper range of absolute sICH risk predicted by the scores does not justify withholding thrombolytic therapy.

### Effects of alteplase for acute stroke on the distribution of functional outcomes: a pooled analysis of 9 trials [^113oLZE9]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke onset increases the overall likelihood of an excellent outcome (no, or nondisabling, symptoms). Any improvement in functional outcome distribution has value, and herein we provide an assessment of the effect of alteplase on the distribution of the functional level by treatment delay, age, and stroke severity.

Methods

Prespecified pooled analysis of 6756 patients from 9 randomized trials comparing alteplase versus placebo/open control. Ordinal logistic regression models assessed treatment differences after adjustment for treatment delay, age, stroke severity, and relevant interaction term(s).

Results

Treatment with alteplase was beneficial for a delay in treatment extending to 4.5 hours after stroke onset, with a greater benefit with earlier treatment. Neither age nor stroke severity significantly influenced the slope of the relationship between benefit and time to treatment initiation. For the observed case mix of patients treated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset (mean 3 hours and 20 minutes), the net absolute benefit from alteplase (ie, the difference between those who would do better if given alteplase and those who would do worse) was 55 patients per 1000 treated (95% confidence interval, 13–91; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Treatment with intravenous alteplase initiated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset increases the chance of achieving an improved level of function for all patients across the age spectrum, including the over 80s and across all severities of stroke studied (top versus bottom fifth means: 22 versus 4); the earlier that treatment is initiated, the greater the benefit.

Discussion

As a major public health problem in the world, improving treatment of AIS deserves continuous effort. An improved intravenous thrombolytic approach could have a major impact on health delivery. TNK is a genetically engineered modified form of rt-PA with better fibrin specificity, high resistance to plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 and slower plasma clearance permitting bolus administration which may facilitate efficient institution of reperfusion therapy.

The TRACE II study excludes patients intended to have endovascular thrombectomy. Although several studies of direct endovascular thrombectomy have reported similar results with and without bridging alteplase in the subgroup of patients who present directly to an endovascular-capable centre, there is residual uncertainty about the best treatment approach and intravenous thrombolysis remains the recommended treatment for patients with AIS within 4.5 hours. Previous studies reported that patients with AIS with large vessel occlusion (LVO) receiving intravenous thrombolysis with TNK having favourable clinical outcomes at 3 months compared with patients receiving intravenous alteplase. Subgroup analysis of the patients with AIS with LVO will be conducted in TRACE II study. A separate TRACE III trial will focus to assess the effect of TNK for patients with AIS with LVO in the late time window (4.5–24 hours after stroke onset).

A double-blind design is considered optimal for phase III randomised controlled trials. However, a double-blind and double-dummy drug administration would significantly increase the complexity of the trial procedure in the very narrow time window and delaying drug administration for patients with AIS is unethical. A PROBE design was therefore chosen for TRACE II. Although some investigators in the local centres may be aware of the treatment allocation, investigators who are involved in the subsequent clinical and imaging assessment of outcomes are blinded to treatment allocation.

The most common AEs in clinical studies of thrombolytic agents are haemorrhage, including ICH and systemic bleeding. The safety profile of TNK appears similar to alteplase and TRACE II uses standard thrombolytic therapy exclusions to reduce the risk of bleeding. Angio-oedema can occur with both TNK and alteplase and is managed according to standard treatment guidelines. No patients developed angio-oedema in the TRACE phase II study.

In conclusion, TRACE II addresses a critical clinical question in patients with ischaemic stroke. Demonstration of non-inferiority of TNK in this trial would support implementation of convenient intravenous thrombolysis with TNK for patients with AIS.

### Effect of IV thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with vessel occlusion in the WAKE-UP trial [^115qTuR6]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

General Study Information

The WAKE-UP trialwas an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1, which provided evidence of clinical benefit of MRI-guided treatment with IV alteplase in patients with acute stroke with an unknown time of symptom onset. Patient selection was based on the replacement of a rigid time window with an imaging pattern identifying early acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at a stage where no relevant vasogenic edema exists (reflected by no marked parenchymal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] images), the so-called DWI-FLAIR mismatch. All investigators received a web-based training to enable harmonized implementation of the DWI-FLAIR mismatch concept. Patients were randomized in WAKE-UP irrespective of infarct location, vessel status, or perfusion measures, and time-of-flight MRA was performed as part of the study protocol.

Primary Research Question

Does treatment with intravenously administered alteplase improve functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke of unknown onset and intracranial vessel occlusion? The classification of level of evidence is Class II.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The study received approval from national competent authorities and ethics committees in all participating countries. WAKE-UP was registered at, unique identifier: NCT01525290, and enrolled patients between September 2012 and June 2017. A complete trial methodology was previously published. A detailed trial protocol has been previously published.

### Safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis by infarct type in patients with No visible occlusion: a secondary analysis of the AcT trial [^117QUSVF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase is a second generation of tissue plasminogen activator with higher specificity for fibrin and a longer half‐life, preventing the need for a 1‐hour infusion that occurs with alteplase. Tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) is now increasingly replacing alteplase for treatment of AIS within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in North America, Europe, and Australia. Given the pharmacological differences between tenecteplase and alteplase and the different pathophysiology of LI compared with NLI, it is unknown whether there are any differences in the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase as compared with alteplase varying on infarct type.

The aim of the current study is to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of intravenous thrombolysis given to patients with LI, NLI, and no visible infarct (NI) on follow‐up imaging in a subset of patients with no visible occlusion. Further, we aimed to assess whether these outcomes differed by thrombolytic type (tenecteplase versus alteplase) in the subpopulations with LI, NI, and NLI.

2.3	Important Administration Instructions

Inspect eptifibatide injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
May administer eptifibatide injection in the same intravenous line as alteplase, atropine, dobutamine, heparin, lidocaine, meperidine, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitroglycerin, or verapamil. Do not administer eptifibatide injection through the same intravenous line as furosemide.
May administer eptifibatide injection in the same IV line with 0.9% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl/5% dextrose. With either vehicle, the infusion may also contain up to 60 mEq/L of potassium chloride.
Withdraw the bolus dose(s) of eptifibatide injection from the 10-mL vial into a syringe. Administer the bolus dose(s) by IV push.
Immediately following the bolus dose administration, initiate a continuous infusion of eptifibatide injection. When using an intravenous infusion pump, administer eptifibatide injection undiluted directly from the 100-mL vial. Spike the 100-mL vial with a vented infusion set. Center the spike within the circle on the stopper top.
Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

Administer eptifibatide injection by volume according to patient weight (see Table 1).

### Treatment and outcome of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117DsLNt]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic transformation after alteplase — blood–brain barrier disruption, imaging correlates, and MMPs are highlighted: human imaging studies indicate that breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is a critical component, and the development of postthrombolytic hemorrhagic transformation involves a complex intersection of alteplase-associated coagulopathy, reperfusion injury, and blood–brain barrier disruption; on vessel imaging, robust collateral circulation is associated with a lower risk of sICH, whereas permeability imaging is another predictor of sICH requiring sufficient barrier disruption for gadolinium entry; barrier disruption occurs at a mean of 13 hours after onset by cerebrospinal fluid gadolinium enhancement and after the initial 24 hours of ischemic injury further breakdown occurs from activation of inherent brain proteases; mechanisms include activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), alteplase promoting activation of plasminogen and secretion of MMPs, and baseline MMP-9 level predicting parenchymal hematoma after thrombolysis.

### Stability of alteplase for ultrasound-facilitated catheter-directed thrombolysis [^114jQT2Y]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

In arms 1, 2, and 3, the concentration of infused alteplase without ultrasound remained within 1% of the originally prepared concentration through 120, 240, and 360 minutes, respectively (Figure 3). The application of ultrasound to the catheter during alteplase infusion induced a rapid decrease in alteplase concentration beginning at 30 minutes in arms 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 3). The percentage of original concentration in the infused solutions at 120, 240, and 360 minutes was ∼90%, ∼80%, and ∼70%, respectively, compared with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Standard for Stability (90%). The rate of degradation seemed to be similar across all 3 alteplase preparations in the presence of ultrasound for the first 120 minutes. Between 120 and 240 minutes, alteplase degradation in the presence of ultrasound proceeded at a similar rate in arms 2 and 3. Beyond 240 minutes, alteplase concentration further declined with no apparent nadir through 360 minutes.

Figure 3.
Stability of alteplase for arms 1, 2, and 3. Alteplase concentrations are measured by RP-HPLC over 2, 4, and 6 hours. (A) When exposed to ultrasound alteplase degrades to approximately 90% of its original concentration in 2 hours. (B) When exposed to ultrasound alteplase degrades to approximately 80% of its original concentration in 4 hours. (C) When exposed to ultrasound alteplase degrades to approximately 70% of its original concentration in 6 hours.

The functionally active alteplase remaining, as measured by concentration bound to PAI-1 as a percentage of time 0, was stable in the absence of ultrasound across all 3 arms and throughout the 120-, 240- and 360-minute infusions, respectively (Figure 4). The application of ultrasound to different concentrations and for increasing durations in arms 1, 2, and 3 had no effect on functionally active alteplase, which was > 99% of baseline across all conditions (Figure 4).

### Cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke [^1176Fx2C]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, we integrated short-term (3 months), middle-term (1 year), and long-term (more than 1 year) outcomes in our model to capture total QALYs and costs in AIS patients. An important advantage of this flexible approach is to take into account the probability of improving health states after stroke whereas previous models assumed that AIS patients could not improve their functional outcome after 3 months. Indeed 25% and 11% of AIS patients still improved mRS scores after 3 months and 1 year, respectively. Thus, our model incorporated published input parameters and allowed to reuse and update input parameters from similar settings for future cost-effectiveness studies of tenecteplase at different thresholds.

Given that tenecteplase was cost-effective in all base case and scenarios compared to alteplase, our results have direct implications for clinical practice and stroke care management. First, the initial costs of thrombolysis with tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) are lower than alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) in some countries. For example, medication costs would be $1705 less per case treated with tenecteplase in Australiaand $550 in Nepal. In some European countries, the costs of tenecteplase are higher than those of alteplase, that is, €987 for tenecteplase 50 mg and €791 for alteplase 70 mg in the Netherlands,€740 for tenecteplase and €729 for alteplase in Belgium. If a specific tenecteplase vial for stroke (i.e. 25 mg) was to become available in the future, this would reduce the initial IVT treatment costs for AIS patients. Second, tenecteplase has a longer half-life requiring one bolus injection compared to a 1-h alteplase infusion. This is a major practical advantage and could reduce medication errors and workload for health staff, especially helpful when staffing becomes scarce. In addition, the use of tenecteplase for both acute cardiac and stroke care may save the training costs of health staff from the systemic perspective. Switching from 1-h alteplase infusion to one bolus tenecteplase injection may avoid the need for the Advanced Cardiac Life Support crew during transfer of patients between hospitals. Furthermore, without a 1-h IV infusion, tenecteplase might be a more practical drug in mobile stroke units. Also, the TASTE-A trial showed a superior rate of early reperfusion in the group of tenecteplase administered in mobile stroke units compared to alteplase. Third, "drip-and-ship" LVO patients receiving IVT in primary stroke centers and EVT in comprehensive stroke centers could benefit more from tenecteplase due to earlier recanalization. Consequently, earlier recanalization could reduce the number of patients ultimately undergoing EVT. For example, 22% of the tenecteplase group did not undergo EVT because no retrievable thrombus was visible at the initial angiographic assessment versus 10% in the alteplase group. This implies that initial treatment costs for LVO patients may be further reduced once tenecteplase is routinely administered. Moreover, tenecteplase might be a promising alternative for LVO patients in rural areas and low- and middle-income countries, where access to EVT is limited or health resources are scarce.

### Stability of alteplase for ultrasound-facilitated catheter-directed thrombolysis [^114kS23Q]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. This was a single-center study. Practices and devices are likely to vary at other interventional centers. The catheter is commercially available in lengths of 106 and 135 cm with ultrasound (treatment) zones of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 40, and 50 cm. Because we tested only one size of catheter, we did not evaluate ultrasound exposure duration as a factor in alteplase degradation. The alteplase flow rate and longer exposure to the ultrasound treatment zone may have had an impact on alteplase degradation. We did not measure enzymatic bioactivity of alteplase by using a clot lysis assay. Therefore, we cannot be certain whether the remaining alteplase retained its thrombolytic characteristics. Future studies should link alteplase stability to the timing of administration and to therapeutic outcomes.

Our study also has many strengths. We evaluated preparations with alteplase 2-mg vials, which is the most likely formulation to be used in USCDT, rather than alteplase 50-mg or 100-mg vials used in previous studies. We also performed our assays to correspond to the administration durations in the OPTALYSE PE trial, extending to 2, 4, and 6 hours rather than limiting the analysis to 0, 6, or 60 minutes.

Our study has operational and clinical implications. Other investigators have shown that alteplase mixed in a diluent is stable for 24 hours and should not raise concerns with solutions compounded by pharmacists. However, once a compounded alteplase solution begins to be administered via USCDT, the delivered alteplase dose may be dependent on infusion rate, ultrasound treatment zone exposure, and solution concentration. For example, the alteplase dose delivered to a thrombus with a compounded concentration of 0.04 mg/mL over a treatment zone of 6 cm for 12 hours may differ from a compounded concentration of 0.08 mg/mL over a treatment zone of 50 cm for 24 hours. Thermal effects, localized shear forces, and aggregation may have an impact on the intact alteplase delivered locally. The extent to which intact (nondegraded) alteplase contributes to efficacy is unknown, and this may have contributed to the challenges of identifying an optimum dose. A conservative strategy in the setting of USCDT would be to administer a compounded alteplase solution over a 2-hour interval.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue. Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke. Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas. While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. The practical advantages of bolus administration and having a single thrombolytic on formulary for all relevant indications have positioned tenecteplase as the leading thrombolytic agent in current practice. This review discusses the current evidence and treatment guidelines in this rapidly evolving field.

### Treatment with intravenous alteplase in ischaemic stroke patients with onset time between 4.5 and 24 hours (HOPE): protocol for a randomised, controlled, multicentre study [^113TjJQk]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While intravenous thrombolysis is recommended for patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, there are few randomised trials investigating the benefits of thrombolysis beyond this therapeutic window.

Aim

To determine whether patients who had an AIS selected with the presence of potentially salvageable tissue on CT perfusion at 4.5–24 hours after stroke onset (for stroke with unknown onset time, the midpoint of the time last known to be well and symptom recognition time; for wake-up stroke, the midpoint of the time last known to be well or sleep onset and wake up time) will benefit from intravenous thrombolysis.

Design

HOPE is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label blinded endpoint trial with the stage of phase III. The treatment allocation employs 1:1 randomisation. The treatment arm under investigation is alteplase with standard therapy, the control arm is standard therapy. Eligibility imaging criteria include ischaemic core volume ≤ 70 mL, penumbra ≥ 10 mL and mismatch ≥ 20%.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome is non-disabled functional outcome (assessed as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days).

Discussion

HOPE is the first trial to investigate whether intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase offers benefits in patients who had an AIS presenting within 4.5–24 hours, which has the potential to extend time window and expand eligible population for thrombolysis therapy.

### Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for large vessel ischemic stroke-is there still a role? [^112wCBqs]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

While the efficacy of Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is well established, its impact on large vessel occlusion (LVO) is controversial. Whether IV tPA should be bypassed in favor of endovascular thrombectomy (MT) will be addressed. Compelling evidence exists to suggest tPA administration might be bypassed in tPA eligible patients in favor of MT for LVO. A trial of MT with patients randomized for IV tPA within the 4.5-h time window should conducted at comprehensive stroke centers demonstrating equipoise between time to tPA or MT with time to treatment from ED arrival of 45 min. We may do well to consider the systems pathway taken by interventional cardiologists 15 years ago.

### A matters arising: discussion on urokinase dosing and individualized treatment strategies in the TRUST trial [^112QB2Qz]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Emerging therapies like Tenecteplase are likely to influence urokinase's positioning by potentially replacing it in high-income countries due to efficacy and ease of use. However, in low- and middle-income countries, urokinase's cost-effectiveness ensures its continued preference, particularly in resource-limited regions where newer agents are unaffordable or unavailable. Future research on urokinase should prioritize optimizing its dosing and administration to improve efficacy and safety, particularly in resource-limited settings. Comparative trials in low- and middle-income countries are essential to assess its cost-effectiveness compared to newer drugs like Tenecteplase. Additionally, exploring combination therapies and promoting local production could enhance urokinase's affordability and accessibility, ensuring its role in global stroke care.

### Alteplase (cathflo Activase) [^1113329B]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trials 1 and 2

The data described for Trials 1 and 2 reflect exposure to Cathflo Activase in 1122 patients, of whom 880 received a single dose and 242 received two sequential doses of Cathflo Activase.

In the Cathflo Activase Trials 1 and 2, only limited, focused types of serious adverse events were recorded, including death, major hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary or arterial emboli, and other serious adverse events not thought to be attributed to underlying disease or concurrent illness. Major hemorrhage was defined as severe blood loss (> 5 mL/kg), blood loss requiring transfusion, or blood loss causing hypotension. Non‑serious adverse events and serious events thought to be due to underlying disease or concurrent illness were not recorded. Patients were observed for serious adverse events until catheter function was deemed to be restored or for a maximum of 4 or 6 hours depending on study. For most patients the observation period was 30 minutes to 2 hours. Spontaneously reported deaths and serious adverse events that were not thought to be related to the patient's underlying disease were also recorded during the 30 days following treatment.

Four catheter-related sepsis events occurred from 15 minutes to 1 day after treatment with Alteplase, and a fifth sepsis event occurred on Day 3 after Alteplase treatment. All 5 patients had positive catheter or peripheral blood cultures within 24 hours after symptom onset.

Three patients had a major hemorrhage from a gastrointestinal source from 2 to 3 days after Alteplase treatment. One case of injection site hemorrhage was observed at 4 hours after treatment in a patient with pre-existing thrombocytopenia. These events may have been related to underlying disease and treatments for malignancy, but a contribution to occurrence of the events from Alteplase cannot be ruled out. There were no reports of intracranial hemorrhage.

Three cases of subclavian and upper extremity deep venous thrombosis were reported 3 to 7 days after treatment. These events may have been related to underlying disease or to the long-term presence of an indwelling catheter, but a contribution to occurrence of the events from Alteplase treatment cannot be ruled out. There were no reports of pulmonary emboli.

There were no gender-related differences observed in the rates of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions profiles were similar across all age subgroups.

### Local ultrasound-facilitated thrombolysis in high-risk pulmonary embolism: first Dutch experience [^115Ev96s]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Intervention

According to guidelines, ST is administered in high-risk PE patients without major contraindications (abovementioned major risk factors). USAT is considered in patients with high-risk PE and contraindications for ST whose condition is otherwise stable enough to be transported to the catheterization laboratory. Local practice varies regarding combination with other therapies, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), thrombus aspiration and ST.

USAT was performed by interventional cardiologists (Utrecht) or radiologists (Nieuwegein, Rotterdam, Amsterdam). Venous access was obtained via the femoral or internal jugular vein. The catheters are placed under fluoroscopic guidance according to CTPA images. Before inserting the EKOS-catheters, a pulmonary angiogram was performed. In case of bilateral PE, two EKOS-catheters were placed through the thrombus in the pulmonary artery under fluoroscopy, one on each side, and 12 mg of Alteplase was administered per catheter for 12 h. In case of unilateral PE, one EKOS-catheter was placed, and 24 mg of Alteplase was locally administered for 24 h. Echocardiography is frequently performed after catheter removal to assess the effect of USAT on RV dysfunction. Moreover, the patient's clinical condition is monitored closely. In case of insufficient clinical and echocardiographic improvement, repeat CTPA is often performed to aid further clinical decisions regarding additional therapies. Heparin was administered according to predefined protocols. In one hospital (Utrecht), an intravenous bolus of heparin of 5000 IE or 80 IE per kilogram body weight is administered before USAT, and continuous infusion is started after USAT with a target activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) of 2–2.5. In the other hospitals (Nieuwegein, Rotterdam, Amsterdam) heparin is administered concomitantly, based on a target level of 2.5–3, and continued afterwards. If no bleeding had occurred within 24–48 h after thrombolysis, standard anticoagulation therapy consisting of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was started.

### Infusion techniques for peripheral arterial thrombolysis [^114hFt4R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute limb ischaemia usually is caused by a blood clot blocking an artery or a bypass graft. Severe acute ischaemia will lead to irreversible damage to muscles and nerves if blood flow is not restored in a few hours. Once irreversible damage occurs, amputation will be necessary and the condition can be life-threatening. Infusion of clot-busting drugs (thrombolysis) is a useful tool in the management of acute limb ischaemia. Fibrinolytic drugs are used to disperse blood clots (thrombi) to clear arterial occlusion and restore blood flow. Thrombolysis is less invasive than surgery. A variety of techniques are used to deliver fibrinolytic agents. This is an update of a review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To compare the effects of infusion techniques during peripheral arterial thrombolysis for treatment of patients with acute limb ischaemia.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 20 October 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing infusion techniques for fibrinolytic agents in the treatment of acute limb ischaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We were not able to carry out meta-analyses due to clinical heterogeneity, so we have reported the results and performed the comparisons narratively. The main outcomes of interest were amputation-free survival or limb salvage, amputation, mortality, vessel patency, duration of thrombolysis, and complications such as cerebrovascular accident and major and minor bleeding.

Main Results

Nine studies with a total of 671 participants are included in this update. Trials covered a variety of infusion techniques, dosage regimens, and adjunctive agents. We grouped trials according to types of techniques assessed (e.g. intravenous and intra-arterial delivery of the agent, 'high-' and 'low-dose' regimens of the agent, continuous infusion and 'forced infusion' of the agent, use of adjunctive antiplatelet agents). We assessed the certainty of evidence as very low to low due to the limited power of individual studies to deliver clinically relevant results, small and heterogeneous study populations, use of different inclusion criteria by each study in terms of severity and duration of ischaemia, considerably different outcome measures between trials, and use of different fibrinolytic agents. This heterogeneity prevented pooling of data in meta-analyses. No regimen has been shown to confer benefit in terms of amputation-free survival (at 30 days), amputation, or death. For vessel patency, complete success was more likely with intra-arterial (IA) than with intravenous (IV) infusion (odds ratio (OR) 13.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79 to 62.67; 1 study, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence); radiological failure may be more likely with IV infusion (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38; 1 study, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence). Due to the small numbers involved in each arm and design differences between arms, it is not possible to conclude whether any technique offered any advantage over another. None of the treatment strategies clearly affected complications such as cerebrovascular accident or major bleeding requiring surgery or blood transfusion. Minor bleeding complications were more frequent in systemic (intravenous) therapy compared to intra-arterial infusion (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.56; 1 study, 40 participants), and in high-dose compared to low-dose therapy (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.96; 1 study, 63 participants). Limited evidence from individual trials appears to indicate that high-dose and forced-infusion regimens reduce the duration of thrombolysis. In one trial, the median duration of infusion was 4 hours (range 0.25 to 46) for the high-dose group and 20 hours (range 2 to 46) for the low-dose group. In a second trial, treatment using pulse spray was continued for a median of 120 minutes (range 40 to 310) compared with low-dose infusion for a median of 25 hours (range 2 to 60). In a third trial, the median duration of therapy was reduced with pulse spray at 195 minutes (range 90 to 1260 minutes) compared to continuous infusion at 1390 minutes (range 300 to 2400 minutes). However, none of the studies individually showed improvement in limb salvage at 30 days nor benefit for the amputation rate related to the technique of drug delivery. Similarly, no studies reported a clear difference in occurrence of cerebrovascular accident or major bleeding. Although 'high-dose' and 'forced-infusion' techniques achieved vessel patency in less time than 'low-dose' infusion, more minor bleeding complications may be associated (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.96; 1 study, 72 participants; and OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.32; 1 study, 121 participants, respectively). Use of adjunctive platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists did not improve outcomes, and results were limited by inclusion of participants with non-limb-threatening ischaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to show that any thrombolytic regimen provides a benefit over any other in terms of amputation-free survival, amputation, or 30-day mortality. The rate of CVA or major bleeding requiring surgery or blood transfusion did not clearly differ between regimens but may occur more frequently in high dose and IV regimens. This evidence was limited and of very low certainty. Minor bleeding may be more common with high-dose and IV regimens. In this context, thrombolysis may be an acceptable therapy for patients with marginally threatened limbs (Rutherford grade IIa) compared with surgery. Caution is advised for patients who do not have limb-threatening ischaemia (Rutherford grade I) because of risks of major haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, and death from thrombolysis.

To review the new bolus fibrinolytic drugs derived from tPA: reteplase, lanoteplase, and tenecteplase.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents databases were searched for articles from 1983 to 2001, using the index terms pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, plasminogen activator, reteplase, lanoteplase, and tenecteplase. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Content, inquiry of experts and pharmaceutical companies, and preliminary data presented at recent national and international cardiology conferences.

Study Selection

We selected for review studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of reteplase, lanoteplase, and tenecteplase, and assessed the effects of these bolus fibrinolytic drugs on the angiographic and immediate and long-term outcomes of patients. Of 138 articles identified, 38 were analyzed.

Data Extraction

Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature or presentation at an official cardiology society-sponsored meeting.

Data Synthesis

Tenecteplase and reteplase are comparable with accelerated infusion recombinant tPA in terms of efficacy and safety but more convenient because they are administered by bolus injection. Lanoteplase and heparin bolus plus infusion is as effective as tPA with regard to mortality, but the rate of intracranial hemorrhage is significantly higher.

Conclusion

Given the ease of administration and the similar outcomes compared with accelerated infusion recombinant tPA, it is likely that a key component of contemporary reperfusion will include a bolus fibrinolytic.

### Eptifibatide [^117H35uU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The lower-infusion-rate arm was stopped after the first interim analysis when the 2 active-treatment arms appeared to have the same incidence of bleeding.

Patient age ranged from 20 to 94 (mean 63) years, and 65% were male. The patients were 89% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, and 5% Black, recruited in the United States and Canada (40%), Western Europe (39%), Eastern Europe (16%), and Latin America (5%).

This was a "real world" study; each patient was managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of angiography, PCI, and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. Of the patients in PURSUIT, 13% were managed with PCI during drug infusion, of whom 50% received intracoronary stents; 87% were managed medically (without PCI during drug infusion).

The majority of patients received aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). Heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously, at the physician's discretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5000 units followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units/h. For patients weighing less than 70 kg, the recommended heparin bolus dose was 60 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 12 units/kg/h. A target aPTT of 50 to 70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours after randomization, in which case they received intravenous heparin to maintain an ACT of 300 to 350 seconds.

### Reperfusion rates following intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke: the influence of the method for alteplase delivery [^1137nCdy]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Because alteplase does not penetrate thrombus effectively, this study examined whether a method thought to maximize surface distribution of alteplase on the offending thrombus during IATT would result in greater reperfusion rates in acute ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods

Clinical information, arteriograms, and CT scans following treatment from 85 consecutive patients who underwent IATT by using alteplase within 6 hours of stroke symptom onset were reviewed. Alteplase was delivered through a microcatheter embedded within the thrombus at 1 mg per minute in all cases, and the delivery never exceeded 100 mg of alteplase. Patients who underwent microcatheter contrast injections confirming that alteplase surrounded the thrombus were compared with patients who did not.

Results

Greater than 50% vascular territory reperfusion occurred in 82.2% of patients who underwent IATT with the intention of optimizing alteplase delivery versus 30.0% in patients without this intention (P < .0001, Pearson correlation) with an odds ratio of 15.8 based on nominal regression analysis. Hemorrhagic complication rates between methods were similar. The mRS at 1–3 months, infarct volume, change in NIHSS score by 24 hours, and hospital discharge were positively affected by optimizing alteplase delivery.

Conclusions

A method that intends to evenly distribute alteplase around a thrombus resulted in better reperfusion rates and clinical outcomes compared with methods without this intention. Other predictors positively influencing reperfusion included the presence of slow antegrade flow distal to the clot, earlier time to treatment, lower presenting NIHSS score, and proximal occlusion site.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^113HQLtH]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to intravenous heparin, BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend to consider administering continuous infusion UFH in patients with perceived coexisting high risk of bleeding. Consider administering weight adjusted doses (such as 10 mcg/kg/hour) without the intention of prolonging the aPTT ratio 1.5–2.5 times the control. Observe clinical signs of bleeding because monitoring the aPTT in these patients may be complicated.

### Thrombolysis (different doses, routes of administration and agents) for acute ischaemic stroke [^114PAtjh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability world wide. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is licensed for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in the early hours after symptom onset. It has been shown in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the 2009 Cochrane review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke to reduce dependency but at the increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Methods to reduce the risk of haemorrhage while retaining or enhancing the benefit could increase the use of thrombolytic treatment. While most available information comes from RCTs of intravenous rt-PA at 0.9 mg/kg, it is possible that other doses, drugs and other routes of administration might increase benefit and reduce the hazard.

Objectives

To assess the risks and benefits of different thrombolytic agents, doses and routes of administration for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2012). We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, searched ongoing trials registers and contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Unconfounded randomised and quasi-randomised trials of different doses of a thrombolytic agent, or different agents, or the same agent given by different routes, in people with confirmed acute ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted the data using a structured proforma. We cross-checked and resolved discrepancies by discussion to reach consensus. We obtained translations and additional information from study authors where required.

Main Results

We included 20 trials involving 2527 patients. Concealment of allocation was poorly described. Different doses (of tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, desmoteplase or tenecteplase) were compared in 13 trials (N = 1433 patients). Different agents (tissue plasminogen activator versus urokinase, tissue-cultured urokinase versus conventional urokinase, tenecteplase versus tissue plasminogen activator) were compared in five trials (N = 875 patients). Five trials (N = 485) compared different routes of administration. As some trials compared different agents and different doses, some patients contributed to two analyses. There was an approximately three-fold increase in fatal intracranial haemorrhages in patients allocated to higher than to lower doses of the same thrombolytic drug (odds ratio (OR) 2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 6.04). There was no difference in the number of patients who were dead or dependent at the end of follow-up between those allocated higher or lower doses of thrombolytic drug (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19). Higher versus lower doses of desmoteplase were associated with more deaths at the end of follow-up (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.23 to 8.39). There was no evidence of any benefit for intra-arterial over intravenous treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

These limited data suggest that higher doses of thrombolytic agents may lead to higher rates of bleeding. However, the evidence is inadequate to conclude whether lower doses of thrombolytic agents are more effective than higher doses, or whether one agent is better than another, or which route of administration is the best, for acute ischaemic stroke. At present, intravenous rt-PA at 0.9mg/kg as licensed in many countries appears to represent best practice and other drugs, doses or routes of administration should only be used in randomised controlled trials.

### Effect of time delay on reperfusion after tenecteplase in an extended time window: analysis from the CHABLIS-T trials [^113zADsZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths and important clinical implications. As a post hoc analysis of the CHABLIS‐T randomized clinical trials, which included 199 patients thrombolyzed within the extended time window, it provides robust, high‐quality evidence for the time–benefit association observed. Furthermore, the study used 4 time intervals, analyzed as both continuous and categorical variables in logistic regression models with confirmed linearity, enhancing the persuasiveness of the results. The time–benefit association highlights that, even for selected "slow progressors" within the extended time window, rapid hospital arrival and prompt tenecteplase administration are crucial for achieving major reperfusion post‐thrombolysis. This is especially significant for patients admitted to primary stroke centers lacking endovascular treatment capabilities. For those admitted to or transferred to comprehensive stroke centers, timely treatment and reperfusion are also essential for achieving functional independence. Additionally, rapid reperfusion facilitated by tenecteplase can lead to reduced economic costs by potentially averting the need for endovascular therapy.

### Prolonged use of tissue plasminogen activator for bilateral lower limb arterial occlusion in a neonate [^11721j3Z]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The authors report the case of a 29-week-gestation twin with very severe vascular compromise of both lower limbs secondary to premature twin-twin transfusion. A tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion was used locally for 13 days with complete recovery of perfusion to both legs, demonstrated by serial angiograms, thereby avoiding bilateral amputation. There were no side effects as a result of the continuous administration of tPA. The authors therefore suggest that the benefits of thrombolysis from a local infusion of tPA in neonates may outweigh the potential risks. This case report thus supports the view that under certain circumstances infusion of tPA in neonates may offer significant benefits. J Pediatr Surg 36:654–656.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^1159hm1Z]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION

The Guidelines recommend intermittent infusion as the preferred method of administration. Others advocate continuous infusion. 77 Several observational studies and two RCTs assessed the nephrotoxicity of continuous infusion vs. intermittent infusion. An earlier meta‐analysis of one RCT and five observational studies found a relative risk of 0.6 (95% CI 0.4–0.9, P = 0.02) for nephrotoxicity with continuous infusion. 78 Subsequently, an observational study of 1,430 ICU patients by Hanrahan et al. found an adjusted OR for nephrotoxicity of 8.2 (P ≤ 0.001) with intermittent infusion, although nephrotoxicity was higher with continuous infusion in unadjusted analyses. 76 A 2014 meta‐analysis added this study, as well as another small trial of 55 patients, to the prior studies and found a trend for reduced nephrotoxicity with continuous infusion (risk ratio 0.8, P = 0.3), although only the unadjusted analysis of the Hanrahan et al. study was used for consistency. 79 There was no mortality benefit to continuous infusion. A more recent meta‐analysis did not include the Hanrahan et al. study but did include five additional studies and found a risk ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.47–0.80, P < 0.001) with continuous infusion, with no difference in treatment failure or mortality. 80 The optimal method of administration remains uncertain, and the guideline endorsed approach of intermittent infusion remains the clinical standard.

### Thrombolysis: a critical first-line therapy with an unfulfilled potential [^112uZCoa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A blood clot or thrombus triggers the onset of most vascular diseases, like stroke or heart attack. Thrombolysis is the only treatment that can restore blood flow rapidly and easily. Unfortunately, the standard thrombolytic, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has proven inadequate and is being replaced by invasive endovascular procedures, which are time consuming and limited in their availability in relation to the scope of the problem. Historically, when tPA clinical trials began, it was not recognized sufficiently that without the other natural plasminogen activator, prourokinase (proUK), thrombolysis by tPA was seriously compromised. The reason is that the 2 activators have complementary mechanisms of action in fibrinolysis, making their combination a requirement for optimal efficacy and synergy. Biological fibrinolysis also uses both activators, explaining why such low endogenous concentrations are sufficient. A low-dose sequential combination of tPA and proUK was tested in acute myocardial infarction, where it was exceptionally effective and safe. Because native proUK at pharmacological doses was vulnerable to spontaneous conversion to urokinase, jeopardizing safety, a site-directed mutant was developed that improved proUK's plasma stability fivefold without interfering with its mode of action. Mini-bolus tPA followed by low-dose proUK infusion is a simple, safe, effective, and promising first-line treatment of acute thrombotic disorders.

### Is there a rationale for the continuous infusion of cefepime? A multidisciplinary approach [^116UwxJ8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

This review is the fruit of multidisciplinary discussions concerning the continuous administration of beta-lactams, with a special focus on cefepime. Pooling of the analyses and viewpoints of all members of the group, based on a review of the literature on this subject, has made it possible to test the hypothesis concerning the applicability of this method of administering cefepime. Cefepime is a cephalosporin for injection which exhibits a broader spectrum of activity than that of older, third-generation cephalosporins for injection (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime). The specific activity of cefepime is based on its more rapid penetration (probably due to its zwitterionic structure, this molecule being both positively and negatively charged) through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, its greater affinity for penicillin-binding proteins, its weak affinity for beta-lactamases, and its stability versus certain beta-lactamases, particularly derepressed cephalosporinases. The stability of cefepime in various solutions intended for parenteral administration has been studied, and the results obtained demonstrated the good compatibility of cefepime with these different solutions. These results thus permit the administration of cefepime in a continuous infusion over a 24-h period, using two consecutive syringes.

### Update on the effects of treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute ischemic stroke [^1131191J]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) represents a major cause of death and disability all over the world. The recommended therapy aims at dissolving the clot to re-establish quickly the blood flow to the brain and reduce neuronal injury. Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is clinically used with this goal.

Areas Covered

A description of beneficial and detrimental effects of rt-PA treatment is addressed. An overview of new therapies against AIS, such as new thrombolytics, sonolysis and sonothrombolysis, endovascular procedures, and association therapies is provided. Updates on the pathophysiological process leading to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is also discussed.

Expert Opinion

rt-PA treatment in AIS patients is beneficial to recovery outcomes. To weaken risks and improve benefits, it might be relevant to consider: i) a definitive identification of risk factors for symptomatic ICH; ii). a better organization of the health care system to reduce time-to-treatment and enhance discharge management. The pharmacological improvement of new thrombolytic drugs (such as tenecteplase and desmoteplase) targeting harmful and maximally exploiting beneficial effects might further reduce mortality and disability in AIS.

### Advances in intravenous thrombolytic therapy for treatment of acute stroke [^115ZEiHw]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an effective therapy for treatment of acute ischemic stroke when administered within 3 hours of symptom onset. Three large randomized clinical trials that have attempted to extend the time window for tPA treatment beyond 3 hours have failed to demonstrate convincing evidence of efficacy. A recently published prospective, monitored, multicenter study of 389 patients, who were treated with tPA for ischemic stroke at 57 medical centers (24 academic, 33 community) across the United States, demonstrated favorable outcomes and low rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent advances in neuroimaging, including diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), have the potential to differentiate salvageable ischemic brain tissue from irreversibly injured tissue. Preliminary data suggest that acute stroke patients who present with a PWI lesion that is considerably larger than the initial DWI lesion may be good candidates for intravenous thrombolysis, even beyond 3 hours after symptom onset. Additional research is required to clarify the optimal use of these diagnostic techniques and their cost-effectiveness.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^111jGCUs]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — transition to continuous infusion outlines next steps after failure of bolus therapy: At this stage after attempts to control the SE with bolus intermittent therapy fails, treatment recommendations are to use continuous infusion AEDs to suppress seizures. However, the use of valproate sodium, levetiracetam, and phenytoin/fosphenytoin in intermittent boluses may also be considered if they have not previously been administered, particularly for patients with NCSE who are hemodynamically stable and have not required intubation. Bolus doses of the AED chosen for continuous infusion should be given and can be repeated for breakthrough SE, in addition to starting the continuous infusion. If the first continuous infusion or AED chosen for RSE fails, then switching to a different continuous infusor or starting another agent from the list above is recommended. The AEDs most often recommended for use as a continuous infusion are midazolam, propofol, and pen- tobarbital; in some countries, thiopental will also be used.

### Current indications and results of thrombolysis by intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [^111wr3n1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

A number of landmark trials have proven the efficacy of thrombolysis by intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the acute phase of the ischemic stroke. Despite the recently extended time window of 4.5 hours, the number of people who are being treated in most centers is low. Several reasons seem to account for this, including poor recognition of symptoms, delays in emergency transport, low levels of public awareness, or age limits originally imposed by drug regulatory rules. Trials are ongoing to possibly extend the indications to the treatment. A major effort is to extend the time window by bridging the treatment with neuroprotective approaches, or by identifying subgroups that may particularly benefit from recanalization and reperfusion. Procedures using ultrasounds or alternative intravenous compounds are also being investigated with promising results.

### Role of N-acetylcysteine in non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review [^111nx244]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management of patients with acute liver failure remains a challenge. In view of the limited number of organs available, aggressive and early medical optimization remains key. Medical options mostly include supportive care.

Previous studies and meta-analyses suggested that NAC could play a supportive role in patients with non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure. This article presents an updated meta-analysis, with a total of 7 studies being included. The last meta-analysis was conducted in 2015 by Hu et al and included 4 studies. Our results were different from those of Hu et al and showed significant improvement in overall survival in patients with non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure treated with NAC.

The route of delivery of NAC was intravenous in all the studies included in our analysis, except for that of Mumtaz et al, who administered NAC orally. NAC was administered as a continuous infusion in 3 studies, while in the other 3 studies a loading dose was given prior to the continuous infusion. A systematic review comparing oral with intravenous NAC administration showed similar levels of hepatotoxicity in rats with acetaminophen overdose, and the route of dosing did not make much difference. NAC is a well-tolerated drug and has a low adverse effect profile. The adverse effects that have been reported include allergic reactions (bronchospasm, rash), cardiac pathologies (arrhythmias) and other generalized symptoms (dizziness, peripheral edema).

### A matters arising: discussion on urokinase dosing and individualized treatment strategies in the TRUST trial [^114EPzj8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of the INTRECIS registry, a recent intravenous thrombolysis registry for Chinese ischemic stroke patients treated within 4.5 h of onset. This analysis stratified patients into low (10,000–16,700 IU/kg), moderate (16,800–23,300 IU/kg), and high-dose (23,400–30,000 IU/kg) urokinase groups. Compared to the low-dose group, the high-dose group demonstrated significantly improved 90-day functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale 0–1: 79.07% vs. 67.03%, P = 0.007) with comparable safety (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage: 1.16% vs. 2.00%, P = 0.648). However, as an observational registry, potential confounders such as selection bias and unmeasured variables may influence these findings, underscoring validation through randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of weight-based urokinase dosing strategies. While extensive Chinese studies have explored urokinase applications across extended time windows, varied dosing regimens, and diverse patient populations, much of this evidence remains within the Chinese literature. Although our recent systematic review comprehensively synthesized these findings, the TRUST trial contributes valuable data to the international literature through its rigorous, randomized controlled trial design.

### The infusion illusion [^111TapmX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Currently, the standard of care for high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding involves the use of a continuous intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion over 72 h. However, the article by Andruilli et al. details the results of a randomized controlled trial indicating that a less intensive regimen consisting of a once-daily bolus of PPI injection may lead to similar outcomes when compared to standard therapy. We will discuss these findings as well as comment on their validity, generalizability, and adaptability to clinical practice.
