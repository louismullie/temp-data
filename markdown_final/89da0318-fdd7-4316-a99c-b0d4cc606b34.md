## Question

What is the causative organism in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which organism is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and how confident we can be in that answer across settings and populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the clinical entity and the adult population of interest. Then, I should verify the highest-quality epidemiologic data to anchor the ranking of pathogens. Next, I will cross-check with contemporary guidelines and recent meta-analyses to ensure consistency. After that, I should consider age-related and setting-specific variations, including viral etiologies and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope so I don't conflate different syndromes. Community-acquired pneumonia in adults is an acute lung infection in people with minimal recent healthcare exposure, typically diagnosed by compatible symptoms and signs plus radiographic evidence of new consolidation, and it excludes hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, which have different pathogen spectra and management frameworks.

> Now, I should verify the most authoritative epidemiologic dataset. The CDC's population-based surveillance study of 2,488 adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP found that among 853 cases with a pathogen identified, viruses were detected more often than bacteria overall, but among bacterial isolates Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most common pathogen, accounting for about 5% of all cases and roughly 15% of cases with an identified etiology, which supports S. pneumoniae as the leading bacterial cause in hospitalized adults [^114wVzoe].

> Wait, let me verify this against guideline-level summaries and recent high-quality reviews to ensure consistency. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline explicitly lists S. pneumoniae among the major treatable bacterial causes guiding empiric therapy, and contemporary summaries of CAP management reiterate that S. pneumoniae remains the most important bacterial pathogen in adults, aligning with the surveillance signal even though overall pathogen detection rates remain modest [^115TSttT] [^117J4ouG] [^112TN1nD].

> Hold on, I should also check pooled estimates from other regions to avoid a US-centric bias. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of Japanese CAP cohorts reported S. pneumoniae as the most frequently identified pathogen at approximately 20% overall, with Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae following behind, which triangulates with the US finding that pneumococcus leads among identified bacteria despite regional differences in testing and case mix [^117RZf9G].

> I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing beyond immunocompetent adults. In HIV, bacterial CAP etiologies mirror those in the general population, with S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus species predominating, though opportunistic pathogens enter the differential as immunosuppression advances, so the baseline answer still holds for typical adults while acknowledging a broader spectrum in advanced HIV [^1116JmbS] [^1171zyyb].

> Next, I should review age-related patterns because the question is about adults broadly. Incidence of CAP rises sharply with age, and in older adults S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial pathogen, with atypical pathogens relatively less frequent than in younger adults, reinforcing that pneumococcus is the leading bacterial cause across adult age strata even as viral detection becomes more common in hospitalized cohorts [^115EfGbk] [^112TTNgz] [^116ekRc8].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about viruses rather than bacteria. I should double-check the viral contribution so I don't misstate the overall etiology. In the CDC surveillance, respiratory viruses were detected in about 23% of hospitalized adults with CAP, exceeding bacterial detection overall, yet among those with a bacterial isolate, S. pneumoniae still led, which means the correct answer to "most common bacterial cause" remains S. pneumoniae even though viruses collectively may outnumber bacteria in some hospitalized cohorts [^114wVzoe] [^113DT4n3].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. For community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative organism among identified bacterial pathogens, typically representing roughly 15–20% of cases with an etiologic diagnosis in contemporary series, while acknowledging that overall pathogen detection is incomplete and that viruses account for a substantial proportion of cases in hospitalized adults [^114wVzoe] [^117RZf9G] [^117J4ouG].

---

The most common causative organism of community-acquired pneumonia in adults is **Streptococcus pneumoniae** [^112TN1nD], accounting for about 20–30% of cases [^117RZf9G]. Other frequent pathogens include **Haemophilus influenzae**, atypicals (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella) [^115TSttT], and respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) [^117J4ouG] [^113DT4n3]. In severe cases or those with risk factors, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) [^115bxj19] and Gram-negative rods (e.g. Pseudomonas) may occur [^115bxj19]. Empiric therapy should cover S. pneumoniae and atypicals [^115TSttT], with adjustments based on severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns [^112nw1MB].

---

## Most common causative organism

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative organism of CAP in adults, accounting for approximately 20–30% of cases [^114anNs8] [^117RZf9G]. It is a Gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract and can cause invasive disease, particularly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities [^1175Y5fH].

---

## Other common causative organisms

While Streptococcus pneumoniae predominates, **other pathogens** commonly cause CAP in adults:

| **Pathogen** | **Frequency** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Haemophilus influenzae | 10–15% | - Common in COPD exacerbations <br/> - Smokers [^116axh5T] |
| Mycoplasma pneumoniae | 5–10% | - Atypical pneumonia <br/> - Younger adults [^1137avvW] |
| Chlamydia pneumoniae | 5–10% | - Atypical pneumonia <br/> - Often mild [^1137avvW] |
| Legionella pneumophila | 2–5% | - Severe pneumonia <br/> - Associated with water exposure [^notfound] |
| Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) | 2–5% | - Severe pneumonia <br/> - Post-influenza <br/> - Healthcare exposure [^115bxj19] |
| Respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) | 20–30% | - Variable severity <br/> - Often co-infect with bacteria [^114wVzoe] [^113DT4n3] |

---

## Risk factors influencing causative organisms

Several patient-specific factors influence the **causative organism** in adult CAP:

- **Age**: Older adults are more likely to have Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Gram-negative rods [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: COPD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and immunosuppression increase risk for specific pathogens [^116axh5T].
- **Healthcare exposure**: Recent hospitalization or long-term care residence increases risk for MRSA and Gram-negative rods [^116axh5T].
- **Smoking**: Increases risk for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Identifying the causative organism in adult CAP is challenging; **no pathogen is identified in approximately 50% of cases** [^114anNs8] [^114wVzoe]. This is due to:

- **Low diagnostic yield**: Sputum cultures and blood cultures have low sensitivity [^117NND7L].
- **Prior antibiotic use**: Reduces culture yield [^117NND7L].
- **Atypical pathogens**: Difficult to detect with standard methods [^1137avvW].

---

## Clinical implications for treatment

Given the uncertainty in identifying causative organisms, **empiric antibiotic therapy** is recommended [^112hi12x]:

- **Outpatient therapy**: Amoxicillin, doxycycline, or macrolides (if local resistance is low) [^113g1GAS].
- **Inpatient therapy**: Beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^notfound].
- **MRSA or Pseudomonas risk**: Add specific coverage based on risk factors and local epidemiology [^115bxj19].

---

## Conclusion

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative organism of community-acquired pneumonia in adults, accounting for approximately 20–30% of cases [^112TN1nD] [^117RZf9G]. Other common pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae, atypical bacteria, and respiratory viruses [^111wTGxs] [^114wVzoe]. Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover these pathogens, with adjustments based on patient-specific risk factors and local resistance patterns [^115TSttT] [^115bxj19].

## References

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Common infections in older adults [^113mGtJj]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases account for one third of all deaths in people 65 years and older. Early detection is more difficult in the elderly because the typical signs and symptoms, such as fever and leukocytosis, are frequently absent. A change in mental status or decline in function may be the only presenting problem in an older patient with an infection. An estimated 90 percent of deaths resulting from pneumonia occur in people 65 years and older. Mortality resulting from influenza also occurs primarily in the elderly. Urinary tract infections are the most common cause of bacteremia in older adults. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs frequently in the elderly; however, antibiotic treatment does not appear to be efficacious. The recent rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) is a particular problem in the elderly because they are exposed to infections at higher rates in hospital and institutional settings. Treatment of colonization and active infection is problematic; strict adherence to hygiene practices is necessary to prevent the spread of resistant organisms.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.

### Infection in an aging population [^11294Pzb]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The global population is rapidly aging. Currently, 566 million people are ≥ 65 years old worldwide, with estimates of nearly 1.5 billion by 2050, particularly in developing countries. Infections constitute a third of mortality in people ≥ 65 years old. Moreover, lengthening life spans correlate with increased time in hospitals or long-term care facilities and exposure to drug-resistant pathogens. Indeed, the risk of nosocomial infections increases with age, independent of duration spent in healthcare facilities. In this review, we summarize our understanding of how the aging immune system relates to bacterial infections. We highlight the most prevalent infections affecting aging populations including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections and make recommendations for future research into infection in aging populations.

### Infections in older adults [^111RUveB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Infections in elderly patients can prove diagnostically challenging. Age-related factors affecting the immune system in older individuals contribute to nonspecific presentations. Other age-related factors and chronic conditions have symptoms that may or may not point to an infectious diagnosis. Delay in administration of antimicrobials can lead to poor outcomes; however, unnecessary administration of antimicrobials can lead to increased morbidity and contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms. Careful clinical assessment and consideration of patient history and risk factors is crucial. When necessary, antimicrobials should be chosen that are appropriate for the diagnosis and deescalated as soon as possible.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^112TN1nD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Recent Findings

CAP is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common CAP pathogen; however, microbial cause varies by geographic location and host factors. Identification of a microbial cause in CAP remains challenging - 30–65% of cases do not have a pathogen isolated. The use of molecular techniques in addition to culture, serology and urinary antigen testing has improved diagnostic yield. Scoring systems are useful for CAP prognostication and site of care decisions. Studies evaluating novel biomarkers including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and procalcitonin suggest potential adjunctive roles in CAP prognosis. Guideline-based treatment for CAP has changed little in recent years. Effective and timely antimicrobial therapy is crucial in optimizing outcomes and should be based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Macrolides may have additional anti-inflammatory properties and a mortality benefit in severe CAP. Preventive strategies include immunization and modification of specific patient risk factors.

Summary

CAP is common and causes considerable morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach including advanced diagnostic testing, effective and timely antimicrobial therapy and prevention is required to optimize CAP outcomes.

### High infection rate outcomes in long-bone tumor surgery with endoprosthetic reconstruction in adults: a systematic review [^115hZYU6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Limb salvage surgery (LSS) with endoprosthetic replacement is the most common method of reconstruction following bone tumor resection in the adult population. The risk of a postoperative infection developing is high when compared with conventional arthroplasty and there are no appropriate guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis.

Questions/Purposes

We sought to answer the following questions: (1) What is the overall risk of deep infection and the causative organism in lower-extremity long-bone tumor surgery with endoprosthetic reconstruction? (2) What antibiotic regimens are used with endoprosthetic reconstruction? (3) Is there a correlation between infection and either duration of postoperative antibiotics or sample size?

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of the literature for clinical studies that reported infection rates in adults with primary bony malignancies of the lower extremity treated with surgery and endoprosthetic reconstruction. The search included articles published in English between 1980 and July 2011.

Results

The systematic literature review yielded 48 studies reporting on a total of 4838 patients. The overall pooled weighted infection rate for lower-extremity LSS with endoprosthetic reconstruction was approximately 10% (95% CI, 8%-11%), with the most common causative organism reported to be Gram-positive bacteria in the majority of cases. The pooled weighted infection rate was 13% after short-term postoperative antibiotics and 8% after long-term postoperative antibiotics. There was no correlation between sample size and infection rate.

Conclusions

Infection rates of 10% are high when compared with rates for conventional arthroplasty. Our results suggest that long-term antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of deep infection. However, the data should be interpreted with caution owing to the retrospective nature of the studies.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Resistant pathogens in respiratory tract infections in older people [^111zXdUw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia are the most common respiratory tract infections observed in older people and are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality associated with infection. Accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in older people is problematic because of the lack of clear symptoms and signs that are usually seen in younger patients. In addition, the increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy highlights the importance of appropriate therapy. The following review examines the issues associated with the accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections, optimal therapy for older patients, and the mechanisms of emerging bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^114w4TzS]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis epidemiology and management advances — Globally in 2010, IE was associated with 1.58 million disability-adjusted life-years; the incidence of IE caused by Staphylococcus aureus has increased and S aureus is now the most common causative organism in most of the industrialized world; patient characteristics have shifted toward increased mean age, more prosthetic valves and other cardiac devices, and fewer rheumatic heart disease cases; the proportion of IE patients undergoing surgery has increased over time to reach ≈50%; and daptomycin has been evaluated for S aureus bacteremia and IE in a randomized, controlled trial.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Infection in the elderly [^117A4njn]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Many functional, demographic, and immunologic changes associated with aging are responsible for increasing the incidence and severity of infectious diseases in the elderly. Management is complicated by age-related organ system changes. Because many of the elderly are on multiple medications for underlying illnesses, antimicrobial therapy needs to be chosen keeping drug interactions and adverse events in mind. Common infections seen in the elderly are infections of skin and soft tissue, urinary tract, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. Organized and well-funded programs to address infectious disease issues in the elderly are the only way to improve care.

### Ageing and infection [^113CbUhi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Average life expectancy throughout developed countries has rapidly increased during the latter half of the 20th century and geriatric infectious diseases have become an increasingly important issue. Infections in the elderly are not only more frequent and more severe, but they also have distinct features with respect to clinical presentation, laboratory results, microbial epidemiology, treatment, and infection control. Reasons for increased susceptibility include epidemiological elements, immunosenescence, and malnutrition, as well as a large number of age-associated physiological and anatomical alterations. Moreover, ageing may be the cause of infection but infection can also be the cause of ageing. Mechanisms may include enhanced inflammation, pathogen-dependent tissue destruction, or accelerated cellular ageing through increased turnover. In most instances, treatment of infection leads to a satisfactory outcome in the elderly. However, in palliative care situations and in patients with terminal dementia, the decision whether or not to treat an infectious disease is becoming a difficult ethical issue.

### Pneumonia in older adults [^112TTNgz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to address the relevant issues surrounding older adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) today.

Recent Findings

Approximately 1 million people > 65years have CAP in the US per year, which is more than previously reported (or realized). Older adults are vulnerable to the increasing prevalence of viral CAP, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes, but pneumococcus is still the most common pathogen to cause CAP. Racial disparities continue to need to be addressed in order to improve early and late outcomes of older adults with CAP.

Summary

The epidemiology of CAP, specifically for older adults is changing. More recent pathogen incidence studies have included culture, as well as newer microbiological methods to determine etiology. Current disparities among disadvantaged populations, including African-Americans, result in more comorbidities which predisposes to more severe CAP. However, outcomes in the hospital between races tend to be similar, and outcomes between age groups tends to be worse for older compared to younger adults. Finally, the cost of CAP is significant compared to diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction and stroke.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117NND7L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Geriatric infectious diseases: current concepts on diagnosis and management [^116dXGy9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

New information on infectious diseases in older adults has become available in the past 20 years. In this review, in-depth discussions on the general problem of geriatric infectious diseases (epidemiology, pathogenesis, age-related host defenses, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach); diagnosis and management of bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and Clostridium difficile infection; and the unique challenges of diagnosing and managing infections in a long-term care setting are presented.

### Coping with Candida infections [^114GJcjA]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Although Candida spp. exist as normal flora on much of the human body, life-threatening invasive infections by these organisms have increased in recent decades. Candida spp. are now one of the most common causes of nosocomial blood stream infections worldwide, and patients with critical illness or malignant disease demonstrate particular susceptibility. Risk factors are identifiable for virtually all patients who develop invasive candidiasis, and clinicians must maintain vigilance for Candida infections in the appropriate clinical context, given the attributable mortality. This review addresses the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive Candida infections, common clinical manifestations, available diagnostic methods, and current recommendations for initial therapy.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

Cryptosporidiosis — epidemiology and transmission in HIV: Advanced immunosuppression with CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) counts < 100 cells/ mm³ is associated with the greatest risk for prolonged, severe, or extraintestinal disease, and the three species that most commonly infect humans are Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In developing countries, cryptosporidiosis remains a common cause of chronic diarrhea in patients with AIDS, with up to 74% of diarrheal stools demonstrating the organism, whereas in the United States the incidence in patients with HIV is now < 1 case per 1,000 person-years. Infection occurs through ingestion of oocysts, with viable oocysts in feces transmitted directly via contact with infected humans or animals; oocysts can contaminate recreational water sources and public water supplies and may persist despite standard chlorination, and person-to-person transmission is common, especially among sexually active men who have sex with men.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^112uxY2h]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious disease cause of death. We summarize recent findings regarding the epidemiology of CAP in adults, efficacy of vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, diagnostics, and discuss the current controversy between CAP and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

Recent Findings

The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the avian influenza A strain H7N9 are of concern but still these are infrequent causes of CAP. Recent data indicate that vaccinating children also protects adults against CAP by generating significant herd immunity, and that the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in adults may offer some efficacy in preventing CAP caused by vaccine serotypes. The immunochromotagraphic urinary antigen test has improved the diagnostic yield for the aetiology of CAP, and initial data demonstrate that a novel multiplex urinary antigen test will further increase the sensitivity for detection of S. pneumoniae. There has been significant concern that a relatively recently described pneumonia category, HCAP, requires empirical treatment for potentially multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). However, new evidence shows that (at least in Europe) pneumonia caused by MDRO remains uncommon even in HCAP category patients.

Summary

CAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Advances in vaccination and diagnosis should help reduce the amount of disease due to S. pneumoniae, the commonest cause of CAP. Outside of the United States, MDRO are relatively uncommon causes of CAP, and the increased mortality of HCAP category patients seems to be related to their comorbidities and age rather than microbial aetiology.

### Septic arthritis and prosthetic joint infections in older adults [^1143q8tD]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Older adults are at increased risk for septic arthritis and prosthetic joint infections (PJI), owing at least in part to comorbid conditions and frailty. An increasing number of older adults undergo total joint arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. Infections in older adults differ from younger populations by the causative organisms, a great proportion of which are Staphylococcal infections. Targeting important modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors may prevent or reduce the burden of joint infections in older adults. This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prevention of septic arthritis and PJI in older adults.

### Bacterial meningitis in aging adults [^115omhE6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Bacterial meningitis remains a highly lethal disease in older adults, with mortality rates averaging > 20% despite modern antibiotic therapy. In this population, more variable presentations are seen, with fewer patients manifesting fever, neck stiffness, and headache than among younger adults. In addition, many older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) may have other underlying diseases causing symptoms that may be confused with those of meningitis. The spectrum of etiologic bacterial organisms is more broad than that for a younger population, in part because of the increased frequency of severe underlying diseases and in part as a result of immunosenescence. Therapy is complicated by both the range of possible causative organisms and the increasing antibiotic resistance manifested by some. These difficulties, contrasted with the success of vaccination in the pediatric population, highlight the need for improved preventive strategies for older adults. This review outlines some key clinical points in the management of bacterial meningitis in the older adult.

### The etiological role of common respiratory viruses in acute respiratory infections in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DT4n3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

These findings should inform the results of studies that seek to estimate the global, regional, and national burden of disease due to these viruses in older adults. They show that RSV, Flu, PIV, hMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV are important causes of ARI in older adults, and disease burden estimates should take into account the appropriate AFE estimates (for older adults) that we report, rather than the AFE estimates in children aged < 5 years. There is considerable international attention on RSV-associated ARI in older adults at this time, during which novel vaccine and antiviral strategies are being evaluated and prioritized, and more-accurate disease burden estimates (using these results) would help to inform future policies and interventions.

The prevalence of virus detection from etiologic studies of pneumonia in adults is substantially lower than the detection rate in studies of children. The EPIC (Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community) study team showed that the viruses were detected in 26% of adults who had been hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, compared with 73% of children who were admitted to the hospital. There are several reasons for such low levels of detection, such as the inability to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens, the use of diagnostic tests with insufficient sensitivity, the absence of appropriate diagnostic testing methods, the undetectability of the virus at the time of the study, and the presence of unknown pathogens that were not identified. The low rate of virus detection among adults who were hospitalized for pneumonia highlights the need for more-sensitive diagnostic approaches, innovative discovery of pathogens, and assessing viruses in the past history (weeks before the presence of disease). Moreover, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is a very important cause of ARIs and hospital admissions. Only 7 of 16 studies included COPD in the etiologic data, and this information was unclear in the remaining studies, which might have underestimated the role of viral infection in these patients.

### Pneumonia in the elderly [^1156zY9B]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an update on new data about the etiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome in older persons is also addressed.

Recent Findings

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the very elderly (80 years and over). Pneumococcus is also an important etiologic agent of pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities. Clinical signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia are less distinct in this group compared with younger patients. New data about influenza immunization reveal better mucosal immunity with the intranasal vaccine compared with the intramuscular vaccine. A review of clinical trial evidence differs from observational studies that demonstrate a clear benefit of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine in the elderly. The prospect of severe acute respiratory syndrome in older adults is the most important new issue to emerge, as older adults are at increased risk from complications and death.

Summary

There are many challenges in preventing and managing community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly. S. pneumoniae remains the most important cause. The clinical presentation of pneumonia in the very elderly can be nonspecific. Given the safety profile of the vaccine and supportive observational evidence, public health policymakers should continue to support use of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine. However, research into new vaccine strategies, including use of conjugate or common antigen vaccines, is a priority.

### Neutrophils in community-acquired pneumonia: parallels in dysfunction at the extremes of age [^116axh5T]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Aetiology of CAP in adults

Common causes of CAP are listed in table 1, although identifying a causative pathogen is challenging, even in prospective studies.

Table 1
Aetiology of hospitalised CAP in adults in Europe

Across high-income countries, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (ntHI) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the most common causative bacteria identified in CAP, with no significant differences in unselected cohorts of older versus younger adults. Certain patient characteristics increase the likelihood of different causative bacteria. Gram-negative pathogens, ntHI and Staphylococcus aureus are more commonly found in patients with existing lung disease and those from nursing homeswho have significantly increased mortality from pneumonia. Bacterial and viral coinfections are common, identified in up to 31% of adults admitted to hospital with CAP; however, pure viral CAP appears to be less common than CAP with a pure bacterial cause. Secondary bacterial pneumonia following viral infection is associated with high mortality and is the leading cause of death from influenza.

### Epidemiology and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia [^114qq7Rj]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The seriousness of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), despite being a reasonably common and potentially lethal disease, often is under estimated by physicians and patients alike. CAP results in more than 10 million visits to physicians, 64 million days of restricted activity, and 600,000 hospitalizations. This article discusses the epidemiology and bacterial causes of CAP in immunocompetent adults and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115EfGbk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on community-acquired pneumonia:

- **Definition**: CAP is an acute infection of the lungs occurring in an individual who has had little contact with the healthcare system.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of CAP include bacterial infections (such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus) and respiratory viruses (such as influenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus). No causative organism is identified in over 50% of patients.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of CAP is estimated at 248 cases per 100,000 person-years. In adults ≥ 65 years of age, the incidence increases to 630–1640 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The most common complications of CAP include parapneumonic effusion and empyema, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Influenza and bacterial pneumonia are strongly associated with cardiac events including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and HF. Other pathogen-specific complications include Streptococcus pneumonia-associated HUS, rhabdomyolysis and AKI often seen in Legionella pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia-induced rash and mucositis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like), and reactive arthritis after Chlamydia pneumonia. CAP can be classified by severity and setting of care. Nonsevere pneumonia typically presents without signs of respiratory failure or sepsis and is managed in the outpatient or general hospital ward setting. Severe pneumonia is characterized by clinical features, such as respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, uremia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, or hypotension requiring fluids. Non-ICU pneumonia refers to hospitalized patients who do not require intensive care, while ICU pneumonia involves patients with acute respiratory failure or septic shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients requiring hospitalization, CAP is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of 11%.

### Clinical experience in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: lessons from the use of fluoroquinolones [^1171TV3A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of CAP has been complicated by several factors, including the expanding spectrum of causative organisms and the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens. Initial antimicrobial treatment for patients with CAP is usually selected empirically and should provide appropriate coverage against the most common causative organisms, including resistant strains. Respiratory fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are the only antimicrobials that are highly active against the pathogens most frequently implicated in CAP, including macrolide-resistant and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., and atypical agents. This paper reviews recent studies involving adult patients with CAP that suggest that levofloxacin, as compared with other conventional antibiotic treatments, may be associated with better clinical outcomes.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common and potentially serious illness with significant human and economic costs to society. The recent collaborative statement from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) represents the most up-to-date evidence-based guidelines from North America, incorporating important advances in the management of patients with CAP. The cases presented in this review highlight many of the recent recommendations from the IDSA/ATS guidelines.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It puts an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. In addition, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

Malaria — clinical manifestations by prior exposure: The clinical syndromes caused by Plasmodium species depend on prior exposure, and among those who have resided in malarious areas, manifestations depend on whether exposure occurred in stable endemic transmission (year round) or unstable transmission (seasonal, infrequent or very low). In stable endemic areas, children younger than age 5 years may experience chronic infections with recurrent parasitemia leading to severe anemia and death, and children who survive usually acquire partial immunity by age 5 years and maintain this into adulthood if they remain in endemic areas. In stable endemic areas, adults usually experience asymptomatic or milder infections.

### What is the role of newer molecular tests in the management of CAP? [^111JegPL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) accounts for major morbidity and mortality in the United States. With improved broad-spectrum antibiotics, the implementation of diagnostic studies has declined and most patients do not have an etiologic pathogen of CAP identified. To enhance the appropriate use of antiviral agents and prevent overuse of antibiotics, the successful management of CAP requires rapid and accurate diagnosis of the etiologic agent of CAP. This article provides an overview of the new rapid molecular tests for the diagnosis of influenza, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria compared with nonmolecular tests and how their use for directed therapy can enhance and improve the management of CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Bacterial pneumonia in older adults [^116Gk7Wc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of pneumonia increases with age, and is particularly high in patients who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Mortality rates for pneumonia in older adults are high and have not decreased in the last decade. Atypical symptoms and exacerbation of underlying illnesses should trigger clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms are more common in older adults, particularly among LTCF residents, and should be considered when making empiric treatment decisions. Monitoring of clinical stability and underlying comorbid conditions, potential drug-drug interactions, and drug-related adverse events are important factors in managing elderly patients with pneumonia.

### Health care-associated infections in older adults: epidemiology and prevention [^113bPp9o]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a global public health threat, which disproportionately impact older adults. Host factors including aging-related changes, comorbidities, and geriatric syndromes, such as dementia and frailty, predispose older individuals to infection. The HAI risks from medical interventions such as device use, antibiotic use, and lapses in infection control follow older adults as they transfer among a network of interrelated acute and long-term care facilities. Long-term care facilities are caring for patients with increasingly complex needs, and the home-like communal environment of long-term care facilities creates distinct infection prevention challenges.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^117NfUj3]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the reduced ability with age to mount an adequate response to pathogenic insults, older adults are more susceptible to bacterial infections. Urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia are two common causes of emergency hospital admissions in older adults and cost the NHS £316 million and £235 million, respectively.

Serious bacterial infections often present atypically in older adults, creating a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Fever and other symptoms and signs typically associated with bacterial infections in younger patients may be absent in older adults.

The value of biomarkers in diagnosing serious infection in older adults remains uncertain. Older patients hospitalised with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) mount a significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP) response compared to younger patients, even with more severe disease. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in older adults; a positive urine culture could lead to over-treatment, antimicrobial side effects, and rising levels of antibiotic resistance.

There is limited official guidance to help clinicians decide which biomarkers help diagnose bacterial infections in older adults. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recognises that bacteriuria may be so common in the older population that urine culture "ceases to be a diagnostic test". They advise against the use of urine dipstick testing, however, there is limited evidence as to which tests, if any, are useful.

Therefore, the aim of this review was to systematically review published evidence to determine the value of biomarkers (blood, urinary and salivary) for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older adults in ambulatory care settings.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^117J4ouG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

Nonviral Target Pathogens

Although the focus of this guideline is testing for viral pathogens, the panel recognizes the clinical importance and diagnostic challenges related to detection of nonviral pathogens in CAP. Development and adoption of rapid molecular tests for nonviral pathogens may improve etiologic diagnosis and appropriate selection of antimicrobials. "Atypical" bacterial pathogens (e.g. Legionella spp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) are common causes of CAP with distinct antimicrobial-susceptibility profiles. In endemic regions and high-risk patients, rapid molecular testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis likely improves diagnostic accuracy and informs infection prevention interventions. Specific fungal pathogens can be common causes of CAP in endemic regions (e.g. coccidiomycosis in the American Southwest and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys). Specific recommendations regarding their implementation are beyond the scope of the current document, but the panel notes that these organisms may also be detected by some NAAT arrays and thus recognizes that a potential further benefit may exist.

### Etiology and risk factors for mortality in an adult community-acquired pneumonia cohort in Malawi [^112eTvTj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Globally, pneumonia is the commonest infectious cause of death and the second leading cause of overall life years lost. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, lower respiratory tract infections account for 390,000 deaths in older children and adults each year. Although the etiology and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been thoroughly investigated in large cohorts of adults in well-resourced settings in Europe and North America and more recently in young children (< 5 yr) from sub-Saharan Africa, contemporary data on acute CAP in adults from sub-Saharan Africa are limited. With the exception of cohorts from South Africa, recent studies are small, retrospective, or only use a restricted panel of investigations to define etiology.

In Malawi, a very-low-income country in Southern Africa, pneumonia is the commonest cause of adult hospitalization. There is a generalized HIV epidemic (adult prevalence 10.6%) and high tuberculosis (TB) incidence (159 cases per 100,000 population). These factors create a backdrop distinct from most well-resourced settings and common to many countries in the region that is likely to have a substantial bearing on the epidemiology and etiology of CAP; more comprehensive data are therefore crucial to develop appropriate context-specific management guidelines. Given the continued rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART), recent introduction of infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, and the broader context of rapidly increasing life expectancy and emergence of chronic noncommunicable diseases, contemporaneous data are vital. We therefore conducted a prospective study of adults hospitalized with CAP to the largest central hospital in Malawi to describe etiology and to identify risk factors for mortality to inform the development of local guidelines for antibiotic choice and severity assessment. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of abstracts.

### Moraxella catarrhalis, a human respiratory tract pathogen [^115AkYno]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Moraxella catarrhalis is an exclusively human pathogen and is a common cause of otitis media in infants and children, causing 15%-20% of acute otitis media episodes. M. catarrhalis causes an estimated 2–4 million exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults annually in the United States. M. catarrhalis resembles commensal Neisseria species in culture and, thus, may be overlooked in samples from the human respiratory tract. The prevalence of colonization of the upper respiratory tract is high in infants and children but decreases substantially in adulthood. Most strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to ampicillin but susceptible to several classes of oral antimicrobial agents. Recent work has elucidated mechanisms of pathogenesis and focused on vaccine development to prevent otitis media in children and respiratory tract infections caused by M. catarrhalis in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111VGRXt]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the northern hemisphere about 12/1000 people a year (on average) contract pneumonia while living in the community, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mortality ranges from about 5% to 35% depending on severity of disease, with a worse prognosis in older people, men, and people with chronic diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent community-acquired pneumonia? What are the effects of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient settings, in people admitted to hospital, and in people receiving intensive care? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, intravenous), different combinations, and prompt administration of antibiotics in intensive-care settings, early mobilisation, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine.

Infection-related mortality (IRM) is the most common non-relapse-related cause of death reported after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Information on the incidence and timing of specific infective organisms and the risk factors for IRM is essential to developing prevention strategies. This report provides the first account of IRM in adults and children undergoing HCT in Australia. Between 2013 and 2018, 2705 adult and 689 pediatric first HCTs were identified from the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry database, associated with 1075 (39.7%) total overall deaths in adults and 134 (19.4%) in children. Demographics and causes of death, including infectious etiology and causative organisms, were extracted from the database for adults and children for analysis. At day +100 and 1 year post-HCT, IRM was the leading cause of early post-HCT mortality in adults, accounting for 6.2% and 9.8%, respectively; in children, IRM was the leading cause of post-HCT mortality at day +100 at 2.5% and the second highest cause of post-HCT mortality at 1 year post-HCT at 4.9%, following relapse at 5.8%. In adults, older age, transplantation not in a first complete remission (non-CR1), the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab, donor-positive/recipient-negative cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, and acute graft-versus-host disease were significant risk factors for IRM. However, in children, age > 5 years, acute lymphocytic leukemia as the primary disease, and mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor source were predictive of IRM. Of the deaths in which an infectious etiology was reported in adults (52.4%), 49.3% were attributed to bacteria, 25.3% to fungus, 21.7% to viruses, and 3.6% to post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The most common organisms were Pseudomonas spp, Enterococcus spp, Candida spp, Aspergillus spp, and CMV. In children where an infectious etiology was reported (64%), 13% were attributed to bacteria, 26% to fungus, 45% to viruses, and 16% to PTLD. This report highlights that IRM was the leading cause of death early post-HCT in Australia. Strategies to reduce IRM, such as individualized pre-transplantation infection risk assessment, rapid diagnostics, and prevention management strategies should be explored to determine whether these outcomes can be improved. In addition, improving the completeness and accuracy of reported data, particularly for infectious pathogens, could assist in directing management strategies to reduce IRM in HCT.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^115qUt4N]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition? (2) In the adult emergency department patient with community-acquired pneumonia, what biomarkers can be used to direct initial antimicrobial therapy? (3) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, does a single dose of parenteral antibiotics in the emergency department followed by oral treatment versus oral treatment alone improve outcomes? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Vector-borne disease is a common cause of hospitalized febrile illness in India [^1168uKWF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Acute febrile illness (AFI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in India and other resource-limited settings, yet systematic etiologic characterization of AFI has been limited. We prospectively enrolled adults (N = 970) and children (age 6 months to 12 years, N = 755) admitted with fever from the community to Sassoon General Hospital in Pune, India, from July 2013 to December 2015. We systematically obtained a standardized clinical history, basic laboratory testing, and microbiologic diagnostics on enrolled participants. Results from additional testing ordered by treating clinicians were also recorded. A microbiological diagnosis was found in 549 (32%) participants; 211 (12%) met standardized case definitions for pneumonia and meningitis without an identified organism; 559 (32%) were assigned a clinical diagnosis in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis; and 406 (24%) had no diagnosis. Vector-borne diseases were the most common cause of AFI in adults including dengue (N = 188, 19%), malaria (N = 74, 8%), chikungunya (N = 15, 2%), and concurrent mosquito-borne infections (N = 23, 2%) occurring most frequently in the 3 months after the monsoon. In children, pneumonia was the most common cause of AFI (N = 214, 28%) and death. Bacteremia was found in 68 (4%) participants. Central nervous system infections occurred in 58 (6%) adults and 64 (8%) children. Etiology of AFI in India is diverse, highly seasonal, and difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds alone. Diagnostic strategies adapted for season and age may reduce diagnostic uncertainty and identify causative organisms in treatable, fatal causes of AFI.

### Pneumonia in older persons [^113wwbRc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important threat to the health of older adults. Streptococcus pneumonia remains the most important cause of CAP. Risk factors for CAP include alcoholism, asthma, immunosuppression, chronic respiratory or cardiac disease, institutionalization, and increasing age. Residents of long-term care facilities — a distinct subpopulation of elderly people — are at particularly high risk for developing pneumonia. In this setting, swallowing difficulties, witnessed aspiration, and receipt of sedatives are potentially modifiable risk factors. The clinical presentation in elderly patients is characterized by a reduced prevalence of nonrespiratory symptoms. Few randomized, controlled trials of therapy exist for elderly persons living in the community or in a long-term care setting. Good evidence exists to support the annual administration of influenza vaccine to older adults. Although evidence in clinical trials differs from evidence in observational studies that demonstrate clear benefits associated with the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine in this population, the vaccine is recommended for adults aged

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115WQTJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite many advances in medical science, the mortality rate from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has changed little in the past four decades. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Newer information about the effect of pneumonia on comorbidity and underlying diseases, especially long term, suggests this is an important additional axis that differs from the traditional triangular concept of pathogen, host defense, and antibiotic treatment. A number of clinical scoring systems have been developed to help physicians identify patients with CAP at risk of adverse outcomes. None of the criteria have been prospectively demonstrated to avoid late intensive care unit transfers or lower mortality, raising interest in the use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin. Quantitative bacterial genomic load represents a potentially important risk stratification. Optimal antibiotic management appears to include use of a macrolide, although the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Attempts to improve CAP outcomes through setting measurable process of care standards are to be applauded, but making sure that these standards do not become the end in themselves, but rather that the entire process of care is improved, remains critical.

### Nucleic acid-based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117A4Jyx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Nonviral target pathogens in suspected CAP — diagnostic considerations are highlighted as the panel recognizes the clinical importance and diagnostic challenges of detecting nonviral pathogens, noting that rapid molecular tests may improve etiologic diagnosis and selection of antimicrobials. "Atypical" bacterial pathogens such as Legionella spp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are common causes of CAP with distinct antimicrobial-susceptibility profiles, and in endemic regions and high-risk patients rapid molecular testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis likely improves diagnostic accuracy and informs infection prevention. Specific fungal pathogens, including coccidioidomycosis in the American Southwest and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, can be common causes of CAP, and although specific recommendations are beyond the scope of this document, the panel notes these organisms may also be detected by some NAAT arrays and recognizes that a potential further benefit may exist.

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians focuses on critical issues concerning the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED)with community-acquired pneumonia. It is an update of the 2001 clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of adult patients presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia. A subcommittee reviewed the current literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help answer the following questions: (1) Are routine blood cultures indicated in patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia? (2) In adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without severe sepsis, is there a benefit in mortality or morbidity from the administration of antibiotics within aspecific time course? The evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of evidence.

### Study of community acquired pneumonia aetiology (SCAPA) in adults admitted to hospital: implications for management guidelines [^116ekRc8]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Since the last British study of the microbial aetiology of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) about 20 years ago, new organisms have been identified (for example, Chlamydia pneumoniae), new antibiotics introduced, and fresh advances made in microbiological techniques. Pathogens implicated in CAP in adults admitted to hospital in the UK using modern and traditional microbiological investigations are described.

Methods

Adults aged 16 years and over admitted to a teaching hospital with CAP over a 12 month period from 4 October 1998 were prospectively studied. Samples of blood, sputum, and urine were collected for microbiological testing by standard culture techniques and new serological and urine antigen detection methods.

Results

Of 309 patients admitted with CAP, 267 fulfilled the study criteria; 135 (50.6%) were men and the mean (SD) age was 65.4 (19.6) years. Aetiological agents were identified from 199 (75%) patients (one pathogen in 124 (46%), two in 53 (20%), and three or more in 22 (8%)): Streptococcus pneumoniae 129 (48%), influenza A virus 50 (19%), Chlamydia pneumoniae 35 (13%), Haemophilus influenzae 20 (7%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae 9 (3%), Legionella pneumophilia 9 (3%), other Chlamydia spp 7 (2%), Moraxella catarrhalis 5 (2%), Coxiella burnetii 2 (0.7%), others 8 (3%). Atypical pathogens were less common in patients aged 75 years and over than in younger patients (16% v 27%; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). The 30 day mortality was 14.9%. Mortality risk could be stratified by the presence of four "core" adverse features. Three of 60 patients (5%) infected with an atypical pathogen died.

Conclusion

S pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen to cover by initial antibiotic therapy in adults of all ages admitted to hospital with CAP. Atypical pathogens are more common in younger patients. They should also be covered in all patients with severe pneumonia and younger patients with non-severe infection.

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults [^116shPap]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Dysuria, defined as pain, burning, or discomfort on urination, is more common in women than in men. Although urinary tract infection is the most frequent cause of dysuria, empiric treatment with antibiotics is not always appropriate. Dysuria occurs more often in younger women, probably because of their greater frequency of sexual activity. Older men are more likely to have dysuria because of an increased incidence of prostatic hyperplasia with accompanying inflammation and infection. A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of dysuria. Urinalysis may not be needed in healthier patients who have uncomplicated medical histories and symptoms. In most patients, however, urinalysis can help to determine the presence of infection and confirm a suspected diagnosis. Urine cultures and both urethral and vaginal smears and cultures can help to identify sites of infection and causative agents. Coliform organisms, notably Escherichia coli, are the most common pathogens in urinary tract infection. Dysuria can also be caused by noninfectious inflammation or trauma, neoplasm, calculi, hypoestrogenism, interstitial cystitis, or psychogenic disorders. Although radiography and other forms of imaging are rarely needed, these studies may identify abnormalities in the upper urinary tract when symptoms are more complex.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Microsporidiosis — Epidemiology in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected populations notes that microsporidia are obligate, intracellular, spore-forming organisms that primarily cause moderate to severe diarrhea, are ubiquitous, infect most animal species, and are classified as fungi. Many microsporidia have been reported as pathogens in humans, but Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis are the most common microsporidia that cause infection in HIV-infected patients. They are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, including through ingestion of contaminated food or water and, possibly, through contact with infected animals, and vertical transmission from an infected mother to her child has not been demonstrated in humans but it does occur in animals. Prior to the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevalence rates for microsporidiosis were reported to be as high as 70% in HIV-infected adults with diarrhea; the incidence of microsporidiosis has declined with the widespread use of effective ART, but it is still observed in HIV-infected individuals who are not receiving effective ART, and among HIV-uninfected individuals microsporidiosis is increasingly recognized in children, travelers, organ transplant recipients, contact lens wearers, and the elderly.

Epidemiology of CAP in inpatients and outpatients

Ten articlessearched for pathogenic micro-organisms in a total of 3155 patients with CAP, including outpatients. The results of the meta-analysis are shown in figure 2. S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (20.0% (95% CI 17.2% to 22.8%)), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (10.8% (95% CI 7.3% to 14.3%)), M. pneumoniae (7.5% (95% CI 4.6% to 10.4%)) and C. pneumoniae (3.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 5.5%)); less common were Moraxella catarrhalis (2.0% (95% CI 1.4% to 2.6%)), S. aureus (1.9% (95% CI 0.9% to 2.9%)) and influenza (0.7% (95% CI 0% to 1.6%)). In this category, only one study included the elderly, but did not provide sufficient data for an analysis of differences in microbiological epidemiology in the elderly (online supplemental figure).

Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and adolescents with HIV — microbiology notes that Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus species are the most frequently identified causes of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, the same as in individuals without HIV. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae are among the most common etiologies of pneumonia in association with influenza infection. Atypical bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila species have been reported as infrequent causes of CAP in individuals with HIV. When more extensive testing such as serology to detect IgM antibodies and/or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory secretions was performed, additional infections due to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia were detected.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115WEwym]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Fungal infections in older adults [^116Ka7JJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections have become an increasing problem in older adults. Infections with opportunistic fungi have increased because older patients are more likely to be considered for transplantation, receive aggressive regimens of chemotherapy for cancer, and take immunosuppressive drugs for nonmalignant diseases. In addition, healthy older adults are now more likely to travel extensively and to indulge in outdoor activities, which put them at risk for exposure to endemic mycoses. Although many of the clinical manifestations of fungal infections in older and younger adults are similar, there are aspects of histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis that are unique to older patients. Treatment of older adults with amphotericin B is difficult because of the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of the drug. Although they are less toxic, azoles must be used carefully for treatment of older adults, who are more likely to experience serious drug-drug interactions than are younger persons.

### Perioperative infection after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: risk factors, causative pathogens, and long-term outcomes [^115GhLt3]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Nosocomial infections are the most common complication among critically ill patients and contribute to poor long-term outcomes. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are highly susceptible to perioperative infections, yet it is unclear what factors influence infection onset and functional recovery. The objective was to investigate risk factors for perioperative infections after aSAH and relate causative pathogens to patient outcomes.

Methods

Clinical records were obtained for 194 adult patients with aSAH treated at our institution from 2016 to 2020. Demographics, clinical course, complications, microbiological reports, and outcomes were collected. χ², univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze risk factors.

Results

Nearly half of the patients developed nosocomial infections, most frequently pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Patients with infections had longer hospital stays, higher rates of delayed cerebral ischemia, and worse functional recovery up to 6 months after initial hemorrhage. Independent risk factors for pneumonia included male sex, comatose status at admission, mechanical ventilatory use, and longer admission, while those for urinary tract infection included older age and longer admission. Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus spp. were associated with poor long-term outcome. Certain pathogenic organisms were associated with delayed cerebral ischemia.

Conclusion

Perioperative infections are highly prevalent among patients with aSAH and are related to adverse outcomes. The risk profiles for nosocomial infections are distinct to each infection type and causative organism. Although strong infection control measures should be universally applied, patient management must be individualized in the context of specific infections.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1171zyyb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia clarifying statements define qualifying conditions and risks, stating that "The host immune defense disorder is present at the time of infection", that "Transient impairment of immune function, as may occur in the setting of severe sepsis, is not sufficient for the patient to be considered inherently immunocompromised", and that "Patients who have a history of immunocompromising conditions that have resolved should not be considered ICHs". They add that "Systemic conditions with known metabolic effects on immune function should be considered comorbidities but not immunocompromise-defining conditions", and "Persons of advanced age, a population at increased risk for pneumonia, would not be considered ICH under the proposed definition, as increased susceptibility to pneumonia is not synonymous with immunocompromise". Non-immune conditions are excluded because "Mechanical and structural lung diseases that increase the risk for pneumonia are not included in this definition of ICHP", and "Although these conditions add additional risk for pneumonia, they are not systemic immune defects". Regarding infection patterns, "The host immune defense disorder increases the individual's risk for more frequent or severe disease caused by common community pathogens", and "CAP in ICHs with typical organisms, such as S. pneumoniae, can present with more frequent, severe, prolonged, or recurrent manifestations compared with immunocompetent persons". They also note that "The host immune defense disorder increases the risk of pneumonia because of uncommon or opportunistic pathogens", and that an ICH with pneumonia "warrants consideration of additional diagnostic and/or alternative therapeutic strategies beyond those recommended in pneumonia guidelines", with the reminder that "Opportunistic and multiorganism infections can occur… pursuing the identification of a specific etiology is important while considering empiric coverage for patients who are ICHs on the basis of the underlying immune impairment".

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among U.S. adults [^114wVzoe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among U.S. adults. Incidence estimates of pneumonia confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic tests are needed.

Methods

We conducted active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults 18 years of age or older in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville. Patients with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression were excluded. Blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for culture, serologic testing, antigen detection, and molecular diagnostic testing. Study radiologists independently reviewed chest radiographs. We calculated population-based incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization according to age and pathogen.

Results

From January 2010 through June 2012, we enrolled 2488 of 3634 eligible adults (68%). Among 2320 adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia (93%), the median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 46 to 71); 498 patients (21%) required intensive care, and 52 (2%) died. Among 2259 patients who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens available for both bacterial and viral testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%): one or more viruses in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacterial and viral pathogens in 59 (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%). The annual incidence of pneumonia was 24.8 cases (95% confidence interval, 23.5 to 26.1) per 10,000 adults, with the highest rates among adults 65 to 79 years of age (63.0 cases per 10,000 adults) and those 80 years of age or older (164.3 cases per 10,000 adults). For each pathogen, the incidence increased with age.

Conclusions

The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was highest among the oldest adults. Despite current diagnostic tests, no pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria. (Funded by the Influenza Division of the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases.).

In summary, we noted increased rates of SIH in all age groups of adults with SLE, driven by sepsis. Although young adults comprised a lower proportion of overall SLE hospitalisation than adults, they had similar SIH rates and comparable costs, and outcomes compared with adult patients with SLE. Future studies focusing on young adults are needed in order to better understand the aetiologies of infections and factors increasing susceptibility to infection-related hospitalisation in this subpopulation of SLE. Additionally, our finding that hospitalisation due to pneumonia was more common among both young adults and adults with SLE compared with patients without SLE deserves further study to determine whether patients with SLE are prone to infection from certain organisms and whether targeted vaccines against these causative agents are warranted.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae epidemiology, pathogenesis and control [^1175Y5fH]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococci) pose a threat to human health. Pneumococcal infections are the most common cause of milder respiratory tract infections, such as otitis and sinusitis, and of more severe diseases, including pneumonia (with or without septicaemia) and meningitis. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the childhood vaccination programme in many countries has led to a notable decrease of severe invasive pneumococcal disease in vaccinated children. However, infections caused by non-vaccine types have concurrently increased, causing invasive pneumococcal disease in unvaccinated populations (such as older adults), which has hampered the effect of these vaccines. Moreover, emerging antibiotic resistance is threatening effective therapy. Thus, new approaches are needed for the treatment and prevention of pneumococcal infections, and recent advances in the field may pave the way for new strategies. Recently, several important findings have been gained regarding pneumococcal epidemiology, genomics and the effect of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, elucidative pathogenesis studies have shown that the interactions between pneumococcal virulence factors and host receptors may be exploited for new therapies, and new vaccine candidates have been suggested. In this Review, we summarize some recent findings from clinical disease to basic pathogenesis studies that may be of importance for future control strategies.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116TbQSz]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bartonellosis — Clinical manifestations in HIV explain that BA lesions "have been associated with nearly every organ system, but cutaneous lesions are the most readily identified", and "These lesions can be clinically indistinguishable from Kaposi sarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, and other skin conditions", while "BA also can cause subcutaneous nodules". Organ involvement varies: "Osteomyelitis is usually caused by B. quintana, and only B. henselae can cause bacillary peliosis hepatis". Bartonella infection "is a major cause of unexplained fever in patients with late-stage AIDS and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm³". It is "a relatively common cause of culture-negative endocarditis… and is most commonly caused by B. quintana and, less frequently, B. henselae".

Blood cultures in adults with CAP — We recommend not obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) and we suggest not routinely obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP (see Table 1) (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence), or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The yield of blood cultures in most series of adults with nonsevere CAP is low, ranging from 2% (outpatients) to 9% (inpatients).

### IDSA clinical practice guideline for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children and adults [^115VGxvA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and initial management of suspected acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults and children were prepared by a multidisciplinary expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America comprising clinicians and investigators representing internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, otolaryngology, public health, epidemiology, and adult and pediatric infectious disease specialties. Recommendations for diagnosis, laboratory investigation, and empiric antimicrobial and adjunctive therapy were developed.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) exposure and screening — routine screening of respiratory or gastrointestinal specimens and preemptive treatment for MAC is not recommended. MAC organisms commonly contaminate environmental sources of infection, such as food and water, and available information does not support specific recommendations regarding avoidance of exposure.
