## Question

Management of Hashimoto

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging thyroid function. Then, I should verify indications for treatment across overt, subclinical, and euthyroid states. Next, I will review levothyroxine dosing strategies, monitoring, and special populations. After that, I need to examine non-levothyroxine options, including selenium, combination therapy, and surgery. Finally, I should consider nodules, malignancy risk, and long-term surveillance, and close with a concise decision algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and staging, because management hinges on accurate classification. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is typically diagnosed by elevated anti-TPO antibodies with supportive ultrasound features and biochemical hypothyroidism, though histology shows lymphocytic infiltration when available, and I should double-check that TSH is the primary screening test and that free T4 is used to distinguish subclinical from overt disease, with anti-TPO helping confirm autoimmunity and prognosticate progression risk [^113v8a1g] [^1135wrtC] [^112s547R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment in all cases. I need to ensure I align indications with guideline strength. For overt hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine is mandatory even if asymptomatic, with the goal of normalizing TSH and relieving symptoms, and I should confirm that this is a strong, evidence-based recommendation across AACE/ATA guidance and contemporary reviews [^1135wrtC] [^112JDJwk].

> Next, I should review subclinical hypothyroidism, where controversy persists. Let me think about TSH thresholds and risk modifiers. AACE/ATA supports treatment when TSH is above 10 mIU/L due to increased risks of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, and suggests individualized consideration when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L, especially with symptoms, positive anti-TPO, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease, whereas the BMJ 2019 guideline advises against routine treatment in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, so I need to frame this as a shared decision incorporating patient preference and comorbidity profile [^115Bv8GQ] [^115fCCwd] [^116jZuEB] [^117KaLMs].

> Wait, let me verify the euthyroid state with positive antibodies. I initially thought treatment might reduce goiter size or prevent progression, but I should correct that. Current guidelines do not recommend levothyroxine solely for euthyroid Hashimoto's without biochemical hypothyroidism, so observation with periodic TSH monitoring is appropriate unless pregnancy is planned or other special circumstances arise [^112JWB2T] [^1135wrtC].

> I will now examine levothyroxine dosing strategy, and I need to ensure I tailor to age and cardiac status. In young, healthy adults with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose of about 1.6 mcg/kg/day can be started, whereas in patients over 50–60 years or with coronary disease, I should start low at 25–50 mcg/day and titrate cautiously to avoid ischemia, and I should confirm that dose adjustments are guided by TSH measured 4–6 weeks after initiation or changes [^114eccCb] [^116unGat] [^1135wrtC].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy, because thresholds and monitoring change. In women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, I should target TSH less than 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, less than 3.0 in the second, and less than 3.5 in the third, and I should double-check that dose often needs to increase by about 30% immediately upon recognition of pregnancy, with TSH checked every 4 weeks through 20 weeks and again postpartum when dose should be returned to pre-pregnancy levels and TSH rechecked at 6 weeks [^116RbwEB] [^1137XPaG] [^114FL39f].

> But wait, what if the patient has persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH on levothyroxine. I should review alternatives. Combination LT4/LT3 therapy may be considered in select patients with persistent symptoms after excluding adherence, absorption, and comorbidity issues, using shared decision-making given mixed RCT results, whereas desiccated thyroid or T3 monotherapy is not recommended by guidelines due to variability and supraphysiologic T3 exposure, so I need to ensure careful selection and monitoring if combination is tried [^112JDJwk] [^114Zoh6v].

> Next, I should review selenium, and I need to be precise about the evidence. Multiple meta-analyses show that selenium supplementation reduces TPOAb and may modestly lower TSH in untreated patients, but guidelines still advise against routine selenium for prevention or treatment of hypothyroidism, so if considered, it should be framed as optional, not standard, and avoided in pregnancy where it is not recommended [^114x3p7j] [^113CzUDT] [^113H1MLV] [^11733xnJ].

> I will now examine surgical indications, and I should confirm they are reserved for select scenarios. Surgery is reasonable for compressive symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or cosmetic concern, for suspicion of malignancy, or for painful Hashimoto's refractory to medical therapy, and emerging randomized and observational data suggest thyroidectomy can improve quality of life and fatigue in carefully selected euthyroid patients with high anti-TPO and persistent symptoms, though benefits must be balanced against operative risks and the need for lifelong levothyroxine [^112Nn1Sc] [^115nEyvJ] [^1136oQvK].

> Let me consider thyroid nodules and cancer risk, and I should double-check that Hashimoto's nodules are managed like other nodules. Nodules in Hashimoto's follow standard ultrasound risk stratification and, if indicated, fine-needle aspiration, with the caveat that cytology may show lymphocytic infiltration and that some guidelines allow benign classification even with suboptimal cellularity when lymphocytes predominate in the right clinical-ultrasound context, and although Hashimoto's coexists with papillary thyroid cancer in a meaningful minority, most data suggest either no adverse effect or a protective association with less aggressive disease, so I should avoid over-calling malignancy risk solely due to thyroiditis [^111RkEuJ] [^115GkPXW] [^113VtYRC].

> Next, I should review long-term monitoring and surveillance, and I need to ensure intervals are evidence-aligned. Once stable on levothyroxine, TSH should be checked every 6–12 months, with closer follow-up after dose changes, in older adults, or with interacting medications, and I should confirm that free T4 is added when TSH is atypical or when central hypothyroidism is suspected, with annual monitoring reasonable in many stable patients though some data question the necessity of strict annual testing for all [^1135wrtC] [^114dMbif] [^113qjYko].

> Hold on, I should verify medication interactions and adherence pitfalls that commonly derail control. Levothyroxine should be taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, separated from calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, and some foods, and patients should be counseled to avoid over-the-counter "thyroid support" supplements that may be adulterated or contain iodine or sympathomimetics, with dose reassessment if new interacting drugs are started [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I should double-check it aligns with the evidence. If TSH is elevated with low free T4, treat overt hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and titrate to normalize TSH. If TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L with normal free T4, individualize treatment based on symptoms, anti-TPO positivity, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular risk, recognizing the BMJ recommendation against routine treatment. If TSH is normal with positive antibodies, observe and monitor TSH annually. If symptoms persist despite normalized TSH, reassess adherence, absorption, and comorbidities, consider combination LT4/LT3 in shared decision-making, and in highly selected euthyroid patients with high anti-TPO and persistent symptoms, discuss thyroidectomy as a potential quality-of-life intervention after multidisciplinary review [^1135wrtC] [^116jZuEB] [^115nEyvJ].

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is managed with **levothyroxine for hypothyroidism** [^112JDJwk] and **regular TSH monitoring** to titrate dose and maintain euthyroidism [^117E3haQ]. Treat subclinical hypothyroidism if TSH > 10 mIU/L or if symptoms, positive anti-TPO, or cardiovascular risk factors are present [^115Bv8GQ] [^115fCCwd]; otherwise, monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^1135wrtC]. Selenium is **not recommended** for routine use [^113H1MLV] [^11733xnJ]. Surgery is reserved for compressive symptoms, suspicion of malignancy, or refractory cases [^112Nn1Sc]. In pregnancy, target TSH trimester-specific limits and increase levothyroxine by 30% immediately upon confirmation [^116RbwEB] [^1137XPaG].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **TSH measurement**: Initial screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction [^112s547R].
- **Free T4**: Assess severity; low in overt, normal in subclinical hypothyroidism [^notfound].
- **Anti-TPO antibodies**: Confirm autoimmune etiology; positive in ~90% of cases [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: Not routine; consider if goiter, nodules, or atypical features [^notfound].

---

## Medical management

### Levothyroxine therapy

- **Indications**: Overt hypothyroidism (low free T4) [^notfound]; subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH > 10 mIU/L or symptoms, positive anti-TPO, or cardiovascular risk [^115Bv8GQ] [^115fCCwd].
- **Initial dosing**: 1.6 mcg/kg/day for healthy adults; lower in elderly or cardiac disease [^114eccCb] [^116unGat].
- **Monitoring**: TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^1135wrtC].
- **Adjustments**: Titrate by 12.5–25 mcg to normalize TSH [^1135wrtC].

---

### Subclinical hypothyroidism

In subclinical hypothyroidism, **treat if TSH > 10 mIU/L** or if TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L with symptoms, positive anti-TPO, or cardiovascular risk; otherwise, monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^115Bv8GQ] [^115fCCwd] [^1135wrtC].

---

### Selenium supplementation

Routine selenium is **not recommended**; evidence is limited and inconsistent [^113H1MLV] [^111oTNGP].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is **indicated** for compressive symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea), suspicion of malignancy, or refractory cases despite optimal medical therapy [^112Nn1Sc]. Procedures include total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy, selected based on gland size, nodules, and patient factors.

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

- **Preconception**: Target TSH < 2.5 mIU/L; adjust dose pre-pregnancy [^116RbwEB].
- **During pregnancy**: Increase levothyroxine by 30% immediately; monitor TSH every 4 weeks [^1137XPaG] [^116RTm1g].
- **Postpartum**: Return to pre-pregnancy dose; check TSH at 6 weeks [^114FL39f].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **levothyroxine is dosed by weight and age**, with close growth and developmental monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Stable patients should have **annual TSH checks**, whereas unstable patients or those with dose changes should be monitored every 6–8 weeks until stable [^1135wrtC]. Patient education should cover adherence, drug interactions, and when to seek care [^112zipRA].

---

## Potential complications and comorbidities

Complications and comorbidities include **progression to overt hypothyroidism** [^117KaLMs], increased cardiovascular risk, and associations with other autoimmune diseases (celiac, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo) [^notfound]. A rare complication is thyroid lymphoma, which warrants vigilance for rapidly enlarging goiters [^112VPuum].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Overt hypothyroidism | Levothyroxine therapy [^112JDJwk] |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/L) | Levothyroxine therapy [^115Bv8GQ] |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L) | Treat if symptomatic, positive anti-TPO, or cardiovascular risk; otherwise monitor [^115fCCwd] |
| Euthyroid with positive anti-TPO | Monitor TSH annually [^notfound] |
| Pregnancy | Increase levothyroxine by 30%; monitor TSH every 4 weeks [^1137XPaG] [^116RTm1g] |
| Compressive symptoms or suspicion of malignancy | Surgical intervention [^112Nn1Sc] |

---

Effective management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis centers on **levothyroxine therapy** with TSH-guided dosing, selective treatment of subclinical disease, and surgery for specific indications, with tailored care in pregnancy and pediatrics.

### Thyroiditis: differential diagnosis and management… [^113WwDsp]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Although Hashimoto's thyroiditis is usually asymptomatic, some patients may complain of a feeling of tightness or fullness in the neck; however, neck pain and tenderness are rare. 6 When hypothyroidism is present, treatment with thyroxine is indicated. 7 Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is also indicated in patients with a TSH level in the normal range, to reduce goiter size and prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism in high-risk patients. 7 Lifetime replacement of levothyroxine is indicated in hypothyroid patients, at a starting dosage of 25 to 50 μg per day, with gradual titration to an average daily dosage of 75 to 150 μg. 5 Therefore, it is recommended that treatment be initiated in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism, in patients with a serum TSH level greater than 10 mU per mL and in patients with a high risk of progression to hypothyroidism.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT Acute symptoms of hyperthyroidism are managed primarily with beta blockers. 3, 6, 7, 9 Antithyroid drugs, which inhibit the production of new T 4, are not indicated in the management of patients with hyperthyroidism because symptoms are caused by the release of preformed T 3 and T 4 from the damaged gland. 6, 9 Replacement of thyroid hormone in the hypothyroid phase is indicated if the patient's symptoms are severe or of long duration. 7 If the hypothyroid phase lasts longer than six months, permanent hypothyroidism is likely.
11. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT The natural history of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis involves four phases that generally unfold over four to six months. The acute phase of thyroid pain and thyrotoxicosis may last three to six weeks or longer. Transient asymptomatic euthyroidism follows. Hypothyroidism often ensues and may last weeks to months or may be permanent. 3 and T 4.

6, 7 Therapy with beta blockers may be indicated for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally effective in reducing thyroid pain in patients with mild cases. Patients with more severe disease require a tapering dosage of prednisone given over two to four weeks.

- infant and pediatric patients

- female patient planning conception

- pregnant patients

- patients difficult to render and maintain in a euthyroid state

- cardiac disease

- presence of goiter, nodule, or other structural changes in the thyroid gland

- presence of other endocrine diseases, such as adrenal or pituitary disorders

- unusual constellation of thyroid function test results

- unusual causes of hypothyroidism, such as induced by agents interfering with the absorption of levothyroxine, impacting thyroid gland hormone production or secretion, affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (directly or indirectly), increasing clearance, or peripherally impacting metabolism.

### Thyroidectomy versus medical management for euthyroid patients with hashimoto disease and persisting symptoms: a randomized trial [^115nEyvJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hashimoto disease is a chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Despite adequate hormone substitution, some patients have persistent symptoms that may be the result of immunologic pathophysiology.

Objective

To determine whether thyroidectomy improves symptoms in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis who still have symptoms despite having normal thyroid gland function while receiving medical therapy.

Design

Randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02319538).

Setting

Secondary care hospital in Norway.

Patients

150 patients aged 18 to 79 years with persistent Hashimoto-related symptoms despite euthyroid status while receiving hormone replacement therapy and with serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody titers greater than 1000 IU/mL.

Intervention

Total thyroidectomy or medical management with hormone substitution to secure euthyroid status in both groups.

Measurements

The primary outcome was general health score on the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) at 18 months. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects of surgery, the other 7 SF-36 subscores, fatigue questionnaire scores, and serum anti-TPO antibody titers at 6, 12, and 18 months.

Results

During follow-up, only the surgical group demonstrated improvement: Mean general health score increased from 38 to 64 points, for a between-group difference of 29 points (95% CI, 22 to 35 points) at 18 months. Fatigue score decreased from 23 to 14 points, for a between-group difference of 9.3 points (CI, 7.4 to 11.2 points). Chronic fatigue frequency decreased from 82% to 35%, for a between-group difference of 39 percentage points (CI, 23 to 53 percentage points). Median serum anti-TPO antibody titers decreased from 2232 to 152 IU/mL, for a between-group difference of 1148 IU/mL (CI, 1080 to 1304 IU/mL). In multivariable regression analyses, the adjusted treatment effects remained similar to the unadjusted effects.

Limitation

Results are applicable only to a subgroup of patients with Hashimoto disease, and follow-up was limited to 18 months.

Conclusion

Total thyroidectomy improved health-related quality of life and fatigue, whereas medical therapy did not. This improvement, along with concomitant elimination of serum anti-TPO antibodies, may elucidate disease mechanisms.

### Quality of life after thyroidectomy in patients with Hashimoto's disease: a systematic review [^113VSVFa]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the leading cause of hypothyroidism in the United States, treated primarily with thyroid hormone replacement. However, some patients experience physiologic or compressive symptoms despite normalization of thyroid hormone levels, and thyroidectomy may provide relief. This systematic review evaluates the impact on quality of life (QoL) after thyroidectomy in HT patients.

Methods

Search strategies were developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The search was from 2003 to 2024. Relevant terms included the following: HT, hypothyroidism, QoL, thyroidectomy/surgery. Studies were screened by title and abstract by two blinded, independent reviewers, and repeated for full-text articles. Patient characteristics were noted. The primary outcome was change in QoL, either through validated questionnaires or changes in symptoms as a proxy for QoL; symptoms were considered either "compressive" or "physiologic".

Results

A total of 2604 abstracts were screened, and 7 (0.3%) studies met inclusion criteria. Briefly, 645 HT patients with persistent symptoms underwent surgery. The majority of patients were female, with an average age of 46–56 y. All had preoperative scores or symptoms indicating poor QoL. Four studies assessed outcomes using the Short Form-36 Health Survey and one study utilized the Thyroid Patient-Reported Outcome questionnaire. The remaining studies did not use validated survey tools to assess QoL, instead assessing symptom improvement during postoperative visits. All studies reported evidence that thyroidectomy has a positive impact on QoL.

Conclusions

There are clear improvements in QoL after thyroidectomy in patients with HT. Patients should be informed that this is a viable treatment option if symptoms persist despite optimized medical management.

### Hashimoto's thyroiditis: an update on pathogenic mechanisms, diagnostic protocols, therapeutic strategies, and potential malignant transformation [^113v8a1g]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis, characterized by thyroid-specific autoantibodies, is one of the commonest autoimmune disorders. Although the exact etiology has not been fully elucidated, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is related to an interaction among genetic elements, environmental factors and epigenetic influences. Cellular and humoral immunity play a key role in the development of the disease; thus, a T and B cells inflammatory infiltration is frequently found. Histopathologic features of the disease include lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, lymphoid follicle formation with germinal centers, and parenchymal atrophy. Moreover, the occurrence of large follicular cells and oxyphilic or Askanazy cells is frequently associated to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Clinically, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized mainly by systemic manifestations due to the damage of the thyroid gland, developing a primary hypothyroidism. Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is clinical and based on clinical characteristics, positivity to serum antibodies against thyroid antigens (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin), and lymphocytic infiltration on cytological examination. The mainstream of treatment is based on the management of the hypothyroidism with a substitution therapy. A relationship between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a possible malignant transformation has been proposed in several studies and involves immunological/hormonal pathogenic links although specific correlation is still debated and needs to be further investigated with prospective studies.

Although most patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are managed medically, surgery is occasionally necessary in hypothyroid patients with significant compressive symptoms, progressive enlargement, or suspicion of malignancy. Commonly, progressive enlargement of a nontoxic goiter may prompt consideration of resection to prevent future development of symptoms, and some asymptomatic patients may request thyroidectomy because their goiter is cosmetically unappealing.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary? [^113qjYko]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism is usually due to primary thyroid failure secondary to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) or destructive therapy (radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy). In the United Kingdom the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism in women is at least 1.4 to 1.9% compared to less than 1% in men, and increases with age. Levothyroxine is the standard replacement therapy and treatment is life long, with the aim of restoring patients to a euthyroid state and normalising thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. Though the treatment of hypothyroidism is straightforward, data from several studies show that only around 60% of patients on thyroxine replacement have normal TSH levels. Thyroxine over replacement is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation and reduction in bone mass in postmenopausal women. In addition a raised TSH level is associated with an unfavourable lipid profile.

Hence periodic monitoring of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is essential in the management of patients to judge the response to therapy, patient compliance, and to adjust doses in relation to advancing age. Annual TFT surveillance is widely recommended. In the UK, the General Practitioner (GP) contract effective from April 2004, which financially rewards primary care practices, recommends that patients with hypothyroidism on thyroxine, should have thyroid function tests recorded at least every 15 months. The recommended frequency of testing is based largely on consensus, and there is limited evidence to support this. The majority of patients currently followed up in our hospital based thyroid register are on 18 monthly follow-up. We undertook a retrospective study to see if there is evidence to support more frequent testing.

### Selenium supplementation in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114x3p7j]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Selenium is an essential trace element required for thyroid hormone synthesis and exerts antioxidant effects. Therefore, it may be of relevance in the management of HT.

Methods:

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of selenium supplementation on thyroid function (thyrotropin [TSH], free and total thyroxine [fT4, T4], free and total triiodothyronine [fT3, T3]), thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibodies [TPOAb], thyroglobulin antibodies [TGAb], thyrotropin receptor antibody [TRAb]), ultrasound findings (echogenicity, thyroid volume), immune markers, patient-reported outcomes, and adverse events in HT. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022308377). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Trials from inception to January 2023 and searched citations of eligible studies. Two independent authors reviewed and coded the identified literature. The primary outcome was TSH in patients without thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT); the others were considered secondary outcomes. We synthesized the results as standardized mean differences (SMD) or odds ratio (OR), assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and rated the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results:

We screened 687 records and included 35 unique studies. Our meta-analysis found that selenium supplementation decreased TSH in patients without THRT (SMD −0.21 [confidence interval, CI −0.43 to −0.02]; 7 cohorts, 869 participants; I² = 0%). In addition, TPOAb (SMD −0.96 [CI −1.36 to −0.56]; 29 cohorts; 2358 participants; I² = 90%) and malondialdehyde (MDA; SMD −1.16 [CI −2.29 to −0.02]; 3 cohorts; 248 participants; I² = 85%) decreased in patients with and without THRT. Adverse effects were comparable between the intervention and control groups (OR 0.89 [CI 0.46 to 1.75]; 16 cohorts; 1339 participants; I² = 0%). No significant changes were observed in fT4, T4, fT3, T3, TGAb, thyroid volume, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-10. Overall, certainty of evidence was moderate.

Conclusions:

In people with HT without THRT, selenium was effective and safe in lowering TSH, TPOAb, and MDA levels. Indications for lowering TPOAb were found independent of THRT.

### Commonly forgotten complication of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^112VPuum]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a frequently encountered condition in clinical practice and management is generally uncomplicated with patients on a stable dose of thyroxine supplementation. However, complications of thyroid lymphoma can develop, though it is rare and hence commonly forgotten by physicians. We present a case of a patient with HT who developed thyroid lymphoma. A 61-year-old woman presented with an enlarged goitre complicated by compressive symptoms and was diagnosed with HT. She was treated with stable dose of thyroxine but her constitutional symptoms of weight loss prompted further investigations and diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was eventually made. She underwent chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy and is currently in remission 1year post-treatment. There should be an increased index of suspicion of primary thyroid lymphoma in patients with HT for early diagnosis and treatment for better outcomes.

### Selenium supplementation in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111oTNGP]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), also referred to as chronic autoimmune or lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most prevalent cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. It affects ∼160 million people globally, with women being 4–10 times more susceptible than men. HT is characterized by chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland, elevated serum antibodies against thyroid antigens, and typical appearance on thyroid ultrasound. Once hypothyroidism develops, the current standard of care is lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT) with levothyroxine (LT4).

Since several trace elements are essential for normal thyroid function, there is increasing interest in their supplementation for the management of HT, in particular the prevention of hypothyroidism. Besides iodine, one of the most discussed candidates is selenium. Selenium intake levels vary by region and are influenced by soil selenium content and selenium availability in the food chain, among other factors. Organ meats and seafoods are common sources of selenium, followed by muscle meats, cereals, and grains. The recommended daily allowance of selenium ranges between 55 and 70 μg for nonpregnant adults, which is often not reached, especially in Europe and some parts of China.

Many thyroid enzymes are selenoproteins, such as the deiodinases that metabolize thyroid hormones and the glutathione peroxidases (GPX) that help to manage oxidative stress in the thyrocyte. Reduced selenium levels have been observed in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, including HT. As a result, supplementing selenium in patients with HT has attracted much attention in recent decades.

So far, it has been suggested that selenium deficiency can exacerbate HT and the development of hypothyroidism. Therefore, preventing selenium deficiencies could be a promising approach to prevent or modify HT-associated hypothyroidism. However, findings from previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effect of selenium supplementation in HT remain inconclusivedue to factors such as a relatively small number of included studies, the inclusion of small and clinical heterogeneous populations (i.e. with and without THRT), and outdated data due to the publication of new trials. In addition, the differences across studies in patient characteristics, outcome definitions, inclusion criteria, and supplementation regimens may result in considerable heterogeneity (I ≥ 75%) and obscure the effect when results are statistically pooled. As a result, selenium supplementation is not currently considered in the guidelines for hypothyroidism or thyroid diseases of the American, European, and South American thyroid associations.

Postpartum levothyroxine adjustment — general and Hashimoto's-specific considerations with directive: The increased LT4 dose requirements during gestation are a function of pregnancy itself; therefore, following delivery, maternal LT4 dosing should be reduced to prepregnancy levels with serum TSH assessed 6 weeks thereafter, though a study demonstrated that more than 50% of women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis required an increase in the pregestational dose postpartum. Following delivery, LT4 should be reduced to the patient's preconception dose and thyroid function testing performed at approximately 6 weeks post partum. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment… [^1135wrtC]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT All patients with HT and hypothyroidism require treatment, even if they are asymptomatic. The goals of treatment include normalizing the TSH level and ameliorating symptoms of hypothyroidism. When deciding on the initial replacement dose of levothyroxine, the patient's age and cardiac status should be considered. A healthy, young patient without coexisting heart disease can be started on a full replacement dosage of levothyroxine. 3 is not routinely recommended. The patient's TSH level should be remeasured four to six weeks after initiation and the dose of levothyroxine adjusted to achieve a value in the normal reference range. Clinicians may try to achieve slightly higher TSH levels in older patients. It is reasonable to make dosage adjustments of 12. 5 to 25 mcg of levothyroxine per day at four- to six-week intervals until the intended TSH level is reached.

In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated TPO antibodies, especially those with a serum TSH level of at least 10 mIU per L or with symptoms, treatment with low-dose levothyroxine should be considered. An initial dosage of 25 to 50 mcg per day can be established and titrated in these patients similarly to patients who have overt hypothyroidism. If therapy with levothyroxine is not initiated, patients should be monitored annually for the development of overt hypothyroidism. 15, 19. TREATMENT Treatment with beta blockers, titrated to a dosage that provides symptomatic relief, is recommended for patients who are symptomatic during the thyrotoxic phase. 12 Prednisone in dosages of 15 to 40 mg per day has been proposed for one to six weeks, followed by tapering dosages of 5 mg every two weeks.

12, 13, 23 During the transient hypothyroid phase, thyroid hormone supplementation is used for patients with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism or in patients of reproductive age who wish to become pregnant. Levothyroxine should be used for 12 months and may then be discontinued because subacute thyroiditis is generally self-limited. 12.

Over the last century, much has been learned about the pathogenesis, manifestations, and management of Graves' disease leading to the establishment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists give recommendations on both the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism. A survey of clinicians performed that same year, however, revealed that current practices diverge from these recently published guidelines in multiple areas. These differences will need to be assessed serially to determine the impact of the guidelines on future clinical practice and perhaps vice versa.

### Quality of life after thyroidectomy for hashimoto disease in patients with persistent symptoms [^116B8VFv]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether thyroidectomy improves quality of life in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis with persistent symptoms despite biochemical euthyroidism.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients undergoing thyroidectomy for Hashimoto thyroiditis at our institution between 2014 and 2018. The following variables were collected: age, race, body mass index, preoperative symptoms, preoperative thyroid peroxidase antibody titer, thyroglobulin antibody titer, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, specimen weight, and histologic presence of thyroiditis. Outcomes included general health score on the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health and responses to a questionnaire addressing postoperative disease management.

Results

A total of 19 patients were included in the study, 18 of whom were female with a mean age of 48 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian. There were no significant differences between the postoperative general health scores of the patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and scores from a healthy control population (66.9 vs 74.1; 95% CI: -16.9 to +2.5, P = 0.16). There were also no differences between groups within the 7 SF-36 subscores. Elevation in preoperative thyroperoxidase antibody correlated with lower reported postoperative energy levels (r = -0.63, P = 0.016) and emotional well-being (r = -.55, P = 0.041); 87.5% of respondents reported being moderately or extremely happy with their decision to proceed with surgery.

Conclusions

Quality of life in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis who undergo thyroidectomy is equivalent to the general population, and the majority are satisfied with surgery. Thyroidectomy is a consideration for patients with persistent symptoms despite optimization on medical therapy.

### Exploring the link between thyroid disorders and obesity: mechanisms, impacts, and clinical implications [^114Yc8Gg]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Obesity and thyroid dysfunction are among the most significant challenges in endocrinology, frequently overlapping to create complexities in weight management. Even after achieving euthyroidism, weight variations persist, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. This review explores the mechanisms linking hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism to weight fluctuations, emphasizing their impact on basal metabolic rate, appetite regulation, glucose and lipid metabolism, and thermogenesis.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive review using PubMed and Google Scholar, applying the search criteria: (obesity OR overweight) AND (Hashimoto's thyroiditis OR hyperthyroidism OR hypothyroidism OR Thyroid Cancer). From this search, we reviewed 500 publications and finally included 71 publications, focusing on broad clinical questions regarding the role of thyroid hormones in weight regulation and metabolism, the impact of thyroid disorders and their treatments on obesity, and approaches for managing obesity in the context of thyroid dysfunction.

Results

In hypothyroidism, the impact of levothyroxine therapy on weight changes is discussed, along with the potential role of T3 supplementation. For hyperthyroid patients, the effects of antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine therapy, and thyroidectomy on weight regulation are explored. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies for managing obesity in thyroid disorders are reviewed. Lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapies are evaluated for their efficacy and potential effects on thyroid function. Lastly, the implications of bariatric surgery are explored, including its effects on thyroid function, medication absorption, and postsurgical management of thyroid disorders.

Conclusion

This review underscores the importance of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to managing obesity in the context of thyroid dysfunction to optimize patient outcomes.

### Surgical management of neck pain and headache associated with pediatric Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^113hh4dG]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Case reports of a painful variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis exist in the literature; however, these cases have only been documented in adult patients and there are no standard treatment guidelines. The aim of this study was to describe an alternative management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis associated with medically intractable head and neck pain in the pediatric population.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Methods

The study was conducted in the Section of Pediatric Otolaryngology at the Cleveland Clinic. We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients (ages 0–18 years) with painful thyroiditis and/or headache who underwent total thyroidectomy from 2005 to 2014 with a clinical diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A thorough chart review was performed, including medical and family history, presenting symptoms, laboratory values, medical and surgical treatment strategies, operative reports, and surgical pathology.

Results

There were 0.02% of patients (5 of 305) who met the criteria of intractable head and or neck pain. All five underwent total thyroidectomy with confirmation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis on surgical pathology. Surgical treatment resulted in complete cervical pain relief and improved headaches with a minimum follow-up of 36 months.

Conclusions

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a relatively common form of autoimmune thyroiditis in pediatric patients that uncommonly results in intractable neck pain or headache. In this case series, thyroidectomy was an effective alternative treatment in the pediatric population for medical failures in chronic painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

### Assessment and treatment of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111Wytoy]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid disorders are prevalent in pregnant women. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has a critical role in fetal development and thyroid dysfunction can adversely affect obstetric outcomes. Thus, the appropriate management of hyperthyroidism, most commonly caused by Graves disease, and hypothyroidism, which in iodine sufficient regions is most commonly caused by Hashimoto thyroiditis, in pregnancy is important for the health of both pregnant women and their offspring. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis can also occur during pregnancy and should be differentiated from Graves disease. Effects of thyroid autoimmunity and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy remain controversial. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. Despite global efforts to eradicate iodine deficiency disorders, pregnant women remain at risk of iodine deficiency due to increased iodine requirements during gestation. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide, including in young adults. As such, the diagnosis of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer during pregnancy is becoming more frequent. The evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in pregnancy pose a particular challenge. Postpartum thyroiditis can occur up to 1 year after delivery and must be differentiated from other forms of thyroid dysfunction, as treatment differs. This Review provides current evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

### Prevalence of hashimoto thyroiditis in adults with papillary thyroid cancer and its association with cancer recurrence and outcomes [^113VtYRC]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for more than 90% of all thyroid neoplasms. Most PTCs are associated with an indolent disease course and have a favorable prognosis even after low-intensity treatment. Therefore, disease management includes a wide range of options, from active surveillance to radical surgery and subsequent radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation. Consequently, the major clinical challenge is to stratify patients by risk of mortality or recurrence. At present, several clinicopathologic characteristics have been recognized as being associated with an unfavorable prognosis, including older age, large primary tumor size, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and distant metastasis. Patients with these risk factors thus require aggressive treatment, whereas low-intensity treatment may be sufficient for patients who do not have these risk factors.

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is the most common human autoimmune disease, and its prevalence has also increased in recent years. Epidemiologic studies have reported a mean coexistence rate between HT and PTC of approximately 23% (range, 5%-85%). Moreover, HT has been considered to be potentially associated with PTC development and progression since it was first described in 1955. Most studies suggest that HT may be a protective factor for PTC because it is associated with less invasive disease at presentation and a lower recurrence rate. This association is appealing and rational because the mechanism may be related to lymphocyte infiltration caused by HT and facilitating antitumor immunity. However, relevant evidence is lacking because no association was found in most multivariate analyses. These conflicting findings may, in part, be attributable to different diagnostic criteria used for HT, low PTC recurrence rates or PTC-related mortality rates, and insufficient study sample size. In addition, few results of the aforementioned studies regarding the association of HT with PTC-related mortality were found. We undertook the present study to assess the association of HT with the progression and prognosis of PTC by examining the association of aggressive characteristics at presentation, structural recurrence, and disease-related mortality of PTC with the presence of coexistent HT.

### Long-term outcome of thyrotoxicosis in childhood and adolescence in the west of scotland: the case for long-term antithyroid treatment and the importance of initial counselling [^111FTPqv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Thyrotoxicosis is rarer and more severe in children and adolescents than in adults, with lower remission rates after antithyroid drug treatment.
Management of paediatric thyrotoxicosis is controversial, particularly concerning the length of time that antithyroid drugs should be administered.

What this study adds?

Thyrotoxicosis caused by the hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto's thyroiditis must be carefully distinguished from Graves' disease since the former carries a better prognosis for spontaneous remission.
Time taken for Graves' disease to remit is too variable for a standard interval (eg, 2–3 years) for stopping antithyroid treatment to be set.
Adherence difficulties are common not only before but also after second-line treatment when long-term thyroxine replacement is required. This has implications for management, including the initial education and counselling of families.

### Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: assessment, management and monitoring [^116KRFxn]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid

The thyroid gland is the endocrine organ most commonly affected by ICI therapy. Determining the frequency of thyroid abnormalities from trials can be challenging due to a variety of definitions used. Several large retrospective reviews, however, have shown around 30% of patients with a variety of primary malignancies develop thyroid dysfunction following ICIs. – Thyroid dysfunction is most common following combination therapy with PD-1 and CTLA inhibitors, followed by PD-1/PDL-1 alone and least common with ipilimumab monotherapy.

Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are described, presumed due to an immune-mediated destructive thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurs earlier in therapy, and is usually transient with a high incidence of subsequent hypothyroidism, although this is not universal. Hypothyroidism can develop either after hyperthyroidism, or de novo, and usually occurs later. Most patients with frank hypothyroidism require thyroid hormone replacement and recovery seems a relatively rare occurrence once clinically overt hypothyroidism has developed, although it is described in those with subclinical hypothyroidism only.

Notably, despite the presumed immune mediated process, the proportion of patients with positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies is far lower than observed in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, ranging from 18% to 45% in more recent studies. Several studies, however, have reported an association between thyroid autoimmunity at baseline, as manifested by positive thyroid autoantibodies, and subsequent risk of ICI induced thyroid dysfunction, although results differ as to whether thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin antibodies show this association. Some studies report that a higher level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline also predicts subsequent thyroid dysfunction.

There are also cases of Graves' disease and thyroid eye disease occurring in combination or alone, mostly in patients treated with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab. – Amongst those cases reporting iodine or technetium uptake it was increased, although reports of TSH-receptor antibodies were inconsistent.

### Preconception management of hyperthyroidism and thyroid status in subsequent pregnancy: a population-based cohort study [^1111W44N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Given these challenges, many endocrinologists offer definitive treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery to women with hyperthyroidism who plan to get pregnant in the future. This reduces risks of Graves disease relapse or exposure to antithyroid drugs in the ensuing pregnancy. However, these women will usually require thyroid hormone replacement in the form of levothyroxine prior to pregnancy. We have previously shown using UK primary care data that most women with hypothyroidism established on levothyroxine prior to pregnancy have suboptimal control during pregnancy, which is associated with increased odds of fetal loss. While the majority of patients with treated hypothyroidism have autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis, this small proportion of patients with prior definitive treatment for hyperthyroidism may be particularly vulnerable to hypothyroidism in pregnancy due to extremely limited thyroid reserve and may therefore fail to meet the increased thyroid demands of pregnancy.

However, there are limited data on the impact of these various preconception strategies on thyroid status in subsequent pregnancy, and it is unclear how much this matter is discussed when counseling women who are offered definitive treatment. We therefore sought to determine trends in the management of hyperthyroidism before and during pregnancy and to explore the impact of different management strategies in women with pre-existing hyperthyroidism on maintaining optimal thyroid status during pregnancy using a national UK clinical research database.

### Deep learning to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis from sonographic images [^116XcbWC]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the main cause of hypothyroidism. We develop a deep learning model called HTNet for diagnosis of HT by training on 106,513 thyroid ultrasound images from 17,934 patients and test its performance on 5051 patients from 2 datasets of static images and 1 dataset of video data. HTNet achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.894 to 0.915), 0.888 (0.836–0.939) and 0.895 (0.862–0.927). HTNet exceeds radiologists' performance on accuracy (83.2% versus 79.8%; binomial test, p < 0.001) and sensitivity (82.6% versus 68.1%; p < 0.001). By integrating serologic markers with imaging data, the performance of HTNet was significantly and marginally improved on the video (AUC, 0.949 versus 0.888; DeLong's test, p = 0.004) and static-image (AUC, 0.914 versus 0.901; p = 0.08) testing sets, respectively. HTNet may be helpful as a tool for the management of HT.

Thyroid events

Background on thyroid events

There is a spectrum of autoimmune thyroid disorders ranging from Hashimoto's disease, in which damage to the thyroid gland may result in permanent hypothyroidism, to Graves' disease, in which antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor stimulate excessive function of the gland, resulting in hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is the most common form of hyperthyroidism [thyrotoxicosis: excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)] (Fig. 1 a), and usually requires treatment with anti-thyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery. A transient, and less common, cause of hyperthyroidism due to autoimmunity is "painless thyroiditis", in which inflammation damages the thyroid, resulting in unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone into the circulation (Fig. 1 b). Only symptomatic treatment is required, and when these stores are depleted, the hyperthyroidism usually resolves. However, in some cases, chronic thyroiditis and hypothyroidism may result, which can become permanent and necessitate thyroid hormone replacement. Notably, TSH-receptor antibodies are not involved in the development of painless thyroiditis, so this test can be used to differentiate painless thyroiditis from Graves' hyperthyroidism.

Hypothyroidism (a state of low circulating thyroid hormone) is routinely managed in primary care. It can be associated with a number of conditions including destruction of the thyroid gland (surgical removal, irradiation, autoimmune disease, idiopathic atrophy, or infiltrative process), inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis/release (iodine deficiency, excess iodide, certain medications [IFN-alpha, lithium], inherited enzyme defects), and transient conditions (therapeutic radioiodine, postpartum, or thyroiditis) (Fig. 1 c). These conditions can result in thyrocyte death and lead to hypothyroidism, which can be treated with thyroid replacement. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), which is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaThyroid disease [^115rhQZQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Successful outcome after surgical management in two cases of the "painful variant" of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^117S4HWv]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe two cases of the rare "painful variant" of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) that were refractory to medical management and in which surgical intervention provided the definitive treatment.

Methods

We thoroughly review the clinical history as well as the laboratory, imaging, and surgical pathology data in these cases, and follow-up of the clinical response over time is provided. The relevant literature is also discussed.

Results

A 56-year-old woman, who had remotely undergone a left hemithyroidectomy and had been diagnosed with HT, sought further assessment because of neck pain and edema. Treatment with corticosteroids was partially successful but led to the development of Cushing's syndrome. A 32-year-old man had pain and swelling of the thyroid and was diagnosed with HT shortly thereafter. Levothyroxine treatment was unsuccessful. Both patients underwent thyroidectomy. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (HT) with a variable degree of fibrosis was found on assessment of pathology specimens. The patients remained asymptomatic after the surgical procedure and did not require any further anti-inflammatory therapy.

Conclusion

In selected cases, surgical treatment may become necessary for effective and permanent control of symptoms and local signs in painful HT. Access to experienced endocrine surgeons is important in order to avoid postoperative complications because the thyroid gland may be small or fibrosed in this rare variant of HT.

### Conservative management of pregnancy in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^111ReRu1]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare thyroid disorder characterized by elevated free thyroid hormones with non-suppressed thyrotropin (TSH). Guidelines for the management of pregnancy in patients with RTH are not well defined. Chorionic villus biopsy is sometimes proposed to manage treatment based on the genotype of the fetus.

Patient Findings

A woman with RTH (c1243C > T, pR320C mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor β (THRB gene)) associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) had three successful pregnancies. During the pregnancies, the mother was treated with levothyroxine (LT4). She never underwent chorionic villus sampling. The babies had normal birth weights. The first child harbored the THRB mutation.

Summary and Conclusions

The management of pregnancies in patients with RTH and the indication for chorionic villus sampling are discussed in these cases. In RTH patients, pregnancies must be planned and closely followed. There is no need for prenatal diagnosis of RTH if the patient, due to limited thyroidal reserve, cannot produce excess of thyroid hormones to harm a normal fetus. The more common challenge in RTH remains how to best manage high maternal thyroid hormone levels, and whether or not to lower thyroid hormone levels based on the genotype of the fetus.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis does not worsen early surgical outcomes in papillary thyroid cancer [^114G7v8v]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The annual incidence of thyroid cancer is rising, and this increase is almost exclusively due to papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). PTC is the most common endocrine malignancy in the United States and it is associated with excellent long‐term survival, often exceeding 97% at 20 years. However, tumor characteristics associated with worsened outcomes include tumor size > 4 cm, age, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), aggressive features on histopathology, and regional or distant disease. Current guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy and regional lymphadenectomy for high‐risk PTC with or without radioactive iodine ablation (RAI) treatment and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression. In contrast, there are several management strategies for low‐risk PTC, which include thyroid lobectomy, active surveillance, and more recently, radiofrequency ablation.

Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT), also termed Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism affecting 22 per 100,000 individuals in the United States. The hallmark of CLT is autoimmune‐mediated failure of thyroid function with possible development of thyroid nodular disease. CLT can be managed conservatively with thyroid hormone replacement in most cases; however, thyroidectomy may be indicated for persistent extrathyroidal symptoms, obstructive symptoms, and concurrent malignancy. CLT and PTC are found to coexist in 8%–36% of cases. A relationship between CLT and PTC was originally described by Dailey et al. in 1955. Since then, no consensus has been reached on whether a causal association exists between CLT and the development of PTC or whether the coexistence of these diagnoses affects surgical and oncologic outcomes. Although some studies suggest that CLT secondary to chronic inflammation confers a higher risk of PTC development, other studies suggest that thyroiditis may decrease tumor aggressiveness by stimulating antitumor immunity.

Despite the frequency with which PTC and CLT coexist, the literature describing a different approach to surgical treatment for patients with PTC and concurrent CLT compared to patients with PTC alone remains scarce. Some factors contributing to a lack of consensus on management for PTC and concomitant CLT include the multiple criteria used to make the diagnosis of CLT, the varied guidelines available for low‐risk PTC, and small sample sizes and heterogeneous patient populations in previous studies. This study examines tumor characteristics and surgical treatment outcomes for patients suffering from PTC with and without CLT at a high‐volume tertiary medical center.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^115D7mfr]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Overt thyroid dysfunction and infertility — associations and treatment rationale are described. In hyperthyroidism, menstrual irregularities were present in 22% of patients versus 8% of age- and weight-matched euthyroid controls, and among hypothyroid women with TSH concentrations > 15 mIU/L, 68% reported irregular menses compared with 12% of euthyroid controls. In infertile populations, 5% had serum TSH levels > 4.5 mIU/L in one cross-sectional study, and among women aged 18–50 years the prevalence of infertility was 5.2% in women with GD and 4% among women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid dysfunction is also reversible, and treatment is generally safe and may exert a positive effect on fertility; therefore, it is reasonable to treat overt thyroid dysfunction in infertile women, with the goal of normalizing thyroid function.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Successful treatment for recurrent painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis by total thyroidectomy [^1136oQvK]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an atypical variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis characterized by thyroid pain and fever. In patients with this condition, anti-inflammatory agents are not always effective as in those with subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, long-term pain management is an important issue. We report herein four cases of painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis requiring total thyroidectomy to relieve thyroid pain and histologic findings of the thyroid gland. All patients had high titers of anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin antibodies. Three were hypothyroid, and the other was euthyroid. During the first visit, four patients had fever and/or thyroid pain with elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and they were treated with oral corticosteroids given continuously or intermittently for 9 to 48 months. Because a reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroids caused recurrent painful attacks, the decision was made to perform surgery. After total thyroidectomy, their symptoms disappeared. The histopathologic characteristics of these hypothyroid cases were advanced fibrosis and destructive thyroid architecture. One euthyroid case showed a mild fibrous change and the presence of foreign body type giant cells. In conclusion, total thyroidectomy is the effective and reliable treatment for patients with recurrent painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Pathologic characteristics include advanced fibrosis and destructive thyroid architecture.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^114Zoh6v]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

### Lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^115N78KC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of thyroid cancer has continued to rise for decades. As of 2018, thyroid cancer ranked ninth among all cancers in the world. The most common pathologic subtype is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which is always associated with favorable overall survival rate. However, Lim et al. have found that the incidence-based mortality of PTC actually increased. The causes for rising mortality are unknown, but may be similar to the causes of the rising incidence — environmental factors. In addition, the recurrence rate of PTC ranges from 20 to 40%, affecting patients' disease-free survival. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is associated with recurrence, and approximately 14–64% of PTC patients have regional LNM. Therefore, analysing potential risk factors for LNM is beneficial to manage the risk stratification of PTC recurrence.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a major thyroid autoimmune disease. The human immune response of HT is destructive, eventually leading to thyroid failure, though the microenvironment surrounding PTC is immunosuppressed and promotes tumor growth. Whether HT may affect the aggressiveness of PTC when the two diseases coexist is an intriguing topic. Some consider positive thyroid autoantibodies to be risk factors for cervical LNM in PTC. Others believe that HT PTCs have a low LNM rate and a better prognosis. However, some studies have suggested that HT has no protective effect on PTC. Overall, the association between HT and LNM in PTC remains controversial. In addition, some PTC patients are found to have lymphocytic infiltration on postoperatively histopathologic examination, even though thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) or ultrasound signs are negative. The diagnosis of HT in these patients may not be prudent.

Through strict diagnostic criteria of HT — preoperative positive serum TPO-Ab and postoperative histopathology of Hashimoto's disease — we conducted detailed stratified analysis and established predictive models to reveal the connection between HT and LNM in PTC.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: a consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^115sRG3z]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) management overview — Despite progress in recent decades, the management of TED remains a challenge (except in the mildest cases). Because of clinical disease heterogeneity and insufficient published evidence on this topic (i.e., scarcity of rigorous RCTs), robust recommendations regarding first-line and second-line treatments are challenging. An individualized approach to the management of TED, based on disease activity, severity, duration, trend across time, impact of the disease on daily living, treatment goals, patient age, and comorbidities, as well as the availability and local costs of such therapies, is advised. Treatment options during both the active phase (generally, immunomodulatory drugs) and the inactive phase (generally, corrective surgical procedures) should be carefully discussed with patients. Finally, regional and even local health care system differences impact the availability of current therapies, and these factors become critical in the individualization of care. Research gaps are listed as the focus for further clinical research.

### American Thyroid Association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^1112NUum]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement of clinical problem — For the purposes of this statement article, goiter will be defined as benign enlargement of the thyroid gland; toxic nodular goiter and thyroid carcinoma are beyond the purview of this article and will not be addressed, and substernal goiter will be defined as thyroid extension past the sternal notch with the patient in the supine position, detected either radiologically or clinically. Patients with goiters may be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid, and the goiter may be simple or a diffuse enlargement without nodules, or may have a uninodular or multinodular pattern. There are various causes for goiter development, which include genetic factors, smoking, natural goitrogens (cassava, etc.), autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves' or Hashimoto's disease), iodine deficiency, malignancy, dyshormonogenesis, and infiltrative disease, and very rare causes of thyroid enlargement are thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary tumors and thyroid hormone resistance. The medical options for treatment of goiter consist primarily of iodine replacement, thyroid hormone replacement, thyroid hormone suppressive therapy, and radioactive iodine.

9. OVERVIEW OF THE MANAGEMENT OF TED

Figure 5 shows an overview of the suggested management of TED. Despite great progress in recent decades, the management of TED remains a challenge (except in the mildest cases). Because of clinical disease heterogeneity and insufficient published evidence on this topic (i.e. scarcity of rigorous RCTs), robust recommendations regarding first-line and second-line treatments are challenging. An individualized approach to the management of TED, based on disease activity, severity, duration, trend across time, impact of the disease on daily living, treatment goals, patient age, and comorbidities, as well as the availability and relative costs of such therapies, is advised.

Treatment options during both the active phase (generally, immunomodulatory drugs) and the inactive phase (generally, corrective surgical procedures) should be carefully discussed with patients. Finally, regional and even local health care system differences impact the availability of current therapies, and these factors become critical in the individualization of care.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: a consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^1168PAWv]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) treatment categorization schema: Because many therapies have not been compared head-to-head or against placebo, the task force "categorized treatments as (1) preferable, (2) acceptable, or (3) may be considered". A therapy is "listed as 'preferred' if more than or equal to two RCTs have shown efficacy against standard of care or placebo with concordant results; 'acceptable' when there exist more than or equal to two RCTs with discordant results… or only a single RCT is available and shows efficacy", and "most included RCTs were not placebo-controlled". Therapies "may be considered" when "benefit is not clear", with evidence possibly from "more than or equal to two RCTs with discordant results… or from single RCTs with small efficacy effects, and from larger well-performed observational studies", and are "utilized in clinical practice only when both 'preferred' and 'acceptable' therapies have already been considered, or the patient is intolerant and/or refuses". The task force also recognizes that "availability, cost, and patient acceptability are paramount" when selecting therapy.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^116KYNbP]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) — prevalence and risk groups: "The prevalence of PPT is approximately 5%, although it has varied markedly in different studies, with frequencies reported from 1.1% to 16.7%". Risk is higher with autoimmunity, including "3–4 times higher in women with diabetes mellitus type 1", and frequencies of "25% in women with chronic viral hepatitis", "14% in women with systemic lupus erythematosus", "44% in women with a prior history of GD", and "27% in patients with antipituitary antibodies". Recurrence is common, as "Individuals who have recovered fully from PPT have a 70% chance of developing PPT in each subsequent pregnancy". Additional notes include that "Women on LT4 therapy secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop PPT if their thyroid gland is not completely atrophic", and that after pregnancy loss, "the prevalence of PPT… is unknown".

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Cancer risk in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a nationwide cohort study [^117N565d]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

This study provides valuable information. This is the first large-scale nationwide cohort study of cancer and HT conducted in an Asian population. Patients with HT, particularly older patients, are at higher risk of developing thyroid and colorectal cancer compared with the general population. In addition, HT patients have an increased relative risk of developing thyroid and colorectal cancer within 3 years and after 3 years, respectively. Clinicians managing HT patients, especially older patients, must be aware of the possible increased risk of thyroid and colorectal cancer within 3 years and after 3 years, respectively. Therefore, strategies to facilitate the prevention of thyroid and colorectal cancer are recommended for these patients.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) ultrasound variants — The follicular variant of PTC may exhibit a non-suspicious US appearance, with an oval shape, well-defined and regular margins, and an absence of microcalcifications, and the follicular variant of PTC is usually larger than the classic PTC. The tall-cell variant of PTC usually shows the traditional US signs of malignancy; these tumors frequently appear as deeply hypoechoic nodules with lobulated margins and microcalcifications, and extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases may also be evident at US examination. The diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC poses a diagnostic challenge at US examination because the gland may appear enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic, as in Hashimoto thyroiditis, and multiple fine and scattered hyperechoic microcalcifications may confer a "starry night" appearance to wide portions of the thyroid.

Hyperthyroidism — antibody testing and radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake interpretation indicate that thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin and thyrotropin receptor antibodies are indicative of GD, whereas antithyroid peroxidase or antithyroglobulin antibodies indicate Hashimoto or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis; biotin ingestion may interfere with certain thyroid immunoassays and should be discontinued if thyroid function results do not match the clinical scenario; in a hyperthyroid patient, a RAI uptake test establishes the functional status of the gland and any nodules which may be present, but does not predict cancer risk; and normal RAI uptake is generally 5% and 25% with uptake usually increased in GD and TMNG and decreased or absent in thyroiditis.
