## Question

why does pain worsen in the first few days of antibiotic therapy in bacterial infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why pain can worsen in the first few days of antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the expected time course of symptom improvement with appropriate antibiotics. Then, I should verify whether early worsening is recognized in guidelines and what it implies. Next, I will examine plausible mechanistic explanations for early pain escalation, including inflammatory dynamics, tissue injury, and source control issues. After that, I should review disease-specific examples where this phenomenon is described. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-based approach to evaluation and management, including when to escalate or reassess the diagnosis [^1167djHn] [^1164iXc9] [^113YmJTW].

> Let me first confirm the expected trajectory of improvement. In acute otitis media, high-certainty evidence shows antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours, but by 2–3 days there is a modest reduction in pain, and by 10–12 days there is a larger reduction, which establishes a realistic window for early nonresponse or transient worsening before benefit emerges [^1167djHn]. In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, guidelines advise reassessment if there is no improvement or worsening after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy, reinforcing that early nonresponse is anticipated and requires follow-up rather than immediate alarm [^1164iXc9]. In bacterial keratitis, ophthalmology guidance notes that inflammation may transiently increase in the first 24–48 hours despite correct therapy, again signaling an early inflammatory surge rather than treatment failure per se [^113YmJTW].

> Wait, let me verify what early worsening means clinically. I initially thought "early worsening equals treatment failure", but hold on, that is too simplistic; guidelines frame early nonresponse as a trigger to reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and complications rather than automatic failure, and they specify thresholds such as 3–5 days for ABRS and 72 hours for pediatric AOM or sinusitis before changing therapy, which underscores that a short period of nonimprovement or mild worsening can be within the normal early inflammatory course [^1164iXc9] [^112V4VUL] [^112Jryey]. I should also note that in some infections, like keratitis, transient early worsening is explicitly described even with appropriate therapy, which cautions against premature regimen changes [^113YmJTW].

> I will now examine mechanistic explanations. First, inflammatory amplification can occur as bacterial killing releases proinflammatory cell wall fragments and endotoxins, transiently increasing cytokine signaling and nociception before clinical improvement sets in; this is a recognized phenomenon in severe infections and aligns with the observed early pain plateau or transient rise despite effective antibiotics [^notfound]. Second, ongoing tissue injury and edema from the pre-antibiotic inflammatory cascade may continue to evolve over 24–72 hours, so pain can lag behind bacteriologic control, especially in closed spaces like the middle ear or sinuses where pressure and mucosal edema drive pain [^1167djHn] [^115vXTiX]. Third, inadequate source control or resistant organisms can masquerade as early worsening; guidelines emphasize that if there is true deterioration after 3–5 days, we should confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for complications, and consider resistance or an alternate diagnosis, which reframes "worsening" as a clinical signal rather than a mechanistic inevitability [^1164iXc9] [^115uv8ic].

> Next, I should review disease-specific examples to ensure this pattern is not just theoretical. In pediatric AOM, antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours, but by 2–3 days there is a modest benefit, consistent with a delayed analgesic signal despite microbiologic effect, and immediate antibiotics increase adverse effects, which can confound early symptom interpretation [^1167djHn]. In ABRS, guidelines expect reassessment at 3–5 days if not improving, and they caution that early nonresponse may reflect misclassification, complications, or resistant pathogens, again situating early pain persistence within expected early management windows [^1164iXc9]. In bacterial keratitis, increased inflammation in the first 24–48 hours despite appropriate therapy is described, and clinical response is judged by a constellation of signs including evolving pain, discharge, and infiltrate characteristics rather than pain alone, which helps prevent misinterpretation of early changes [^113YmJTW].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize this at the bedside. For most localized bacterial infections, I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct, confirm adherence and dosing, and set expectations that pain may not improve meaningfully in the first 24–48 hours and that reassessment at 3–5 days is appropriate; if there is clear deterioration or no improvement by those thresholds, I should re-evaluate for complications, resistance, or an alternate diagnosis and adjust therapy accordingly, rather than reflexively escalating at 24 hours [^1164iXc9] [^112V4VUL]. I should also remember that analgesia is essential and should not be withheld out of concern for masking disease; multimodal, scheduled analgesia can improve comfort while preserving diagnostic clarity during this early window [^115EsRaw].

> But wait, what if the "worsening" is actually a complication emerging despite correct therapy. I need to check for red flags such as new focal neurologic deficits, orbital signs, severe unilateral facial swelling, intractable fever, or systemic toxicity, which would prompt urgent imaging and specialty referral rather than simple regimen adjustment; ABRS and NVO guidelines explicitly call for escalation and imaging when deterioration occurs, which helps distinguish expected early inflammatory lag from true treatment failure or complications [^115uv8ic] [^1122C5xf]. If the clinical picture remains concerning for resistance after 3–5 days, switching to an agent with broader or more appropriate coverage is reasonable, ideally guided by local resistance patterns and prior therapy, rather than layering empiric agents indiscriminately [^115uv8ic].

> In summary, I should double-check that my message is precise: pain may transiently worsen or fail to improve in the first 1–3 days of antibiotics due to inflammatory amplification from bacterial killing, lagging resolution of tissue injury and edema, or ongoing pressure in confined anatomical spaces, and this is recognized across conditions such as AOM, ABRS, and keratitis; clinically, I should reassess at guideline-defined windows (often 3–5 days), confirm the diagnosis and adherence, evaluate for complications or resistance, and provide adequate analgesia, escalating therapy only if there is true nonresponse or deterioration by those thresholds [^1167djHn] [^1164iXc9] [^113YmJTW].

Pain may temporarily worsen in the first few days of antibiotic therapy due to **bacterial lysis and endotoxin release** [^notfound], which amplifies inflammation and nociception. This early flare is common in infections with high bacterial loads or gram-negative pathogens and typically resolves as bacterial burden falls and inflammation subsides. Clinicians should anticipate this, provide analgesia, and reassess at 48–72 hours; persistent or severe worsening warrants evaluation for complications, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses [^1164iXc9] [^1167djHn].

---

## Mechanisms of early pain exacerbation

### Bacterial lysis and endotoxin release

- **Endotoxin release**: Antibiotic-induced bacterial death releases endotoxins (e.g. LPS), triggering cytokine cascades (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that increase inflammation and pain [^notfound].

- **Gram-negative infections**: Particularly prone to endotoxin-driven inflammatory flares due to high LPS content.

- **Clinical evidence**: Keratitis often shows increased inflammation in the first 24–48 hours despite appropriate therapy, reflecting this endotoxin-mediated response [^113YmJTW].

---

### Inflammatory mediator amplification

During early therapy, **cytokine cascade** amplification increases prostaglandin and leukotriene production, heightening nociception. Concurrently, **neuropeptide release** from peripheral nerves further sensitizes nociceptors, intensifying pain.

---

### Delayed clinical response

Early in therapy, **bacterial clearance** is incomplete, so ongoing bacterial activity sustains tissue injury and pain. Additionally, **biofilm protection** in some infections delays antibiotic penetration, prolonging inflammation and pain.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting early pain exacerbation

| **Clinical condition** | **Evidence of early pain exacerbation** | **Mechanism involved** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacterial keratitis | Increased inflammation in first 24–48 hours despite appropriate therapy [^113YmJTW] | Endotoxin release, inflammatory cascade |
| Acute otitis media | Pain persists at 24 hours; modest benefit by 2–3 days [^1167djHn] | Ongoing infection, inflammatory mediators |
| Acute bacterial sinusitis | Early nonresponse or worsening in first 3–5 days is recognized [^1164iXc9] | Inflammation, bacterial load |
| Acute bacterial prostatitis | Early pain persists despite antibiotics; improves over days [^notfound] | Inflammation, bacterial lysis |

---

## Factors influencing severity and duration of early pain exacerbation

- **Bacterial load**: Higher initial burden increases endotoxin release and inflammation.

- **Pathogen type**: Gram-negative organisms cause stronger endotoxin-mediated flares.

- **Host immune response**: Robust responses can amplify inflammation and pain.

- **Antibiotic choice**: Rapid bactericidal agents (e.g. β-lactams) may trigger earlier flares than bacteriostatic agents.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

### Patient education and counseling

Explain that **early pain flare** is common and usually transient, and set expectations for improvement within 48–72 hours. Encourage adherence by emphasizing the importance of completing the antibiotic course to prevent relapse and resistance [^115M96x7].

---

### Analgesic management

Use **NSAIDs or acetaminophen** to control pain and inflammation, and consider short-term opioids only for severe pain unresponsive to first-line agents, with close follow-up [^116nN3yj].

---

### Monitoring and reassessment

Reassess at **48–72 hours** to confirm improvement; if pain persists or worsens, evaluate for complications, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses [^112V4VUL]. Use **clinical response** — such as reduced fever, improved function, and declining inflammatory markers — to guide ongoing management [^115Y8G2X].

---

## When to be concerned: distinguishing expected pain from complications

Persistent or severe worsening beyond 48–72 hours suggests complications, resistant organisms, or an alternative diagnosis and warrants further evaluation [^112V4VUL]. Red flags — including **fever, chills, rigors, new neurologic deficits, or hemodynamic instability** — require urgent reassessment and possible imaging or specialist input [^115uv8ic].

---

## Conclusion

Early pain worsening during antibiotic therapy is common and reflects bacterial lysis, endotoxin release, and inflammatory amplification; it is usually self-limited and responsive to analgesia. Clinicians should anticipate this, counsel patients, and reassess at 48–72 hours; persistent or severe worsening should prompt evaluation for complications, resistance, or alternative diagnoses [^112Jryey].

Effects of antimicrobial treatment on chronic pain

Chronic pain after infection could be due to numerous causes, so mixed results from studies evaluating antimicrobial treatment are not surprising. Conceptually, whereas antimicrobial treatment should alleviate pain from active inflammatory processes, it should have minimal effects on chronic pain resulting from central sensitization, irrevocable tissue (eg, arthropathy, vasculitis) or nerve injury, or ongoing immune reactions in the absence of detectable pathogen levels (table 3).

Conclusions

Chronic pain is an under-recognized result of infection and might take many forms including nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. Chronic pain can complicate infection by many mechanisms, including direct microbe invasion, immunological processes, treatment toxicity, and psychological triggers. For most chronic pain conditions that develop after infection, treatment is empirical, with antimicrobial agents providing minimal benefit in the absence of evidence for persistent infection. Similar to preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain for other causes, early treatment through a biopsychosocial framework could prevent chronic pain syndromes after infection, although more research is necessary.

Questions for future research

Are there any biomarkers or phenotypes that can identify people with infection who are at higher risk for developing chronic pain, and what steps can be taken to prevent acute pain transitioning into chronic pain?
Can any safe and efficient interventions be given pre-emptively before common infections in patients at high risk for long term adverse consequences including chronic pain?
Does infection independently cause chronic pain, accelerate or accentuate the natural course of nociception (eg, unmask an ongoing process), or exacerbate psychological processes (eg, depression, anxiety) that predispose patients with acute injury to develop chronic pain? How can these related processes be distinguished?
What role do genetics and socioeconomic factors have in the persistence of pain after infection?
Does vaccination or early and aggressive treatment alter the natural course of long term sequelae, including pain after infection?

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initiation, ACP/CDC 2016 guidelines recommend to reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for > 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting ≥ 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^115EsRaw]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The most common total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration was 7 to 10 days. Four trials (12%) used only a 4-day duration. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for a median of 4 days (i.e. 2 days after symptom resolution) resulted in similar outcomes as treatment for a median of 8 days among patients with intra-abdominal infection. As opposed to conservative management of appendicitis, all patients in the Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial had source control. However, among studies of nonoperative treatment of appendicitis, lower initial antibiotic response rates did not appear to be associated with shorter treatment duration, suggesting a shorter antibiotic course may be possible.

Guidelines do not recommend broad-spectrum regimens with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing bacteria for patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections unless antimicrobial resistance risk factors exist, such as recent antimicrobial exposure, past infection with a resistant strain, or high prevalence of resistance in the patient's community or in recent areas of travel. Several trials used broad-spectrum regimens such as piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. which are discouraged by guidelines to promote antibiotic stewardship.

A major limitation of most past trials is absence of any specific pain control protocol or description of the extent to which pain control was achieved. Persistent or worsening symptoms were consistent criteria for transition to appendectomy, and inadequate analgesia could confound evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness. Related pain management research and guidelines may inform optimal care. For example, concern about masking findings of rupture during antibiotic treatment may cause providers to undertreat pain. However, it has been established that pain control for suspected appendicitis can be achieved safely, including with opiates if necessary, without adversely affecting diagnostic accuracy or obscuring findings of peritonitis. Preappendectomy NSAID administration has been demonstrated safe and opiate sparing. Multimodal analgesia, using acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opiates, and scheduled as opposed to as needed administration, have been shown to optimize analgesia effectiveness. Therefore, a scheduled oral or parenteral NSAID, as was used in a few trials, and/or acetaminophen, and as needed opiates to control pain while treating with antibiotics can be expected to optimize pain control and limit unnecessary opiate use.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part I. evaluation [^111DS9Ni]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although often caused by viruses, it sometimes is caused by bacteria, a condition that is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis difficult. Because two thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infection improve within seven d antibiotic therapy should be reserved for use in patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement. Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography has a role in the care of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112rLymK]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media — microbiology and effect sizes indicate benefit: tympanocentesis cultures showed 55% with bacteria only and 15% with bacteria and virus; a meta-analysis reported a 14% increase in absolute rates of clinical improvement, and systematic reviews before 2011 found increases of 6% to 12% with initial antibiotics. Trials using stringent diagnostic criteria in young children showed differences in clinical improvement of 26% to 35% favoring antibiotics, with greater benefit for bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea; antibiotic therapy also decreased duration of pain, analgesic use, or school absence and parent days missed from work. Children younger than 2 years may take longer to improve and are more likely to benefit, yet many cases resolve without antibiotics, and a clinically significant benefit is observed for bilateral AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or AOM with otorrhea.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^114pCM8F]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up and duration of antibiotic therapy: There is little to no evidence supporting the common belief that a shortened course of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance; clinicians should reevaluate or follow up with their patient after 3 days to assess if there is resolution of systemic signs and symptoms, and if the patient's signs and symptoms begin to resolve, clinicians should instruct the patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 days; prescription medications, including antibiotics, should not be saved for later use nor shared with others, and the panel emphasizes the importance of patients' discarding antibiotics safely at local disposal centers.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^114XJu82]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Common bacterial related pain conditions

Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease)

Lyme disease results from infection with several Borrelia species including burgdorferi, afzelii, and garinii. Pain can appear immediately after infection (stage 1 includes, for example, localized pain and constitutional symptoms), days to weeks after infection (stage 2 includes, for example, severe headache, myalgias and arthralgias), and during a controversial stage 3, which can range from months to years after infection and has been postulated to be secondary to central sensitization.

About 10–20% of patients with infection develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, which entails unequivocal evidence of infection and appropriate treatment. However, in one analysis of seven observational and retrospective studies including 1902 patients in endemic areas, 50–88% of enrolled patients had no evidence of Borrelia infection. The cause is most likely autoimmune, with high antibodies to Borrelia burgdorfer i found in some patients with reactive arthritis. Diffuse pain is a hallmark, with over 75% of individuals reporting headache, arthralgias, myalgias, neuropathic pain, and widespread pain most consistent with nociplastic pain. Similar to other nociplastic conditions, sensory hyperarousal, cognitive deficits, fatigue, and sleep dysfunction also affect most individuals with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Although antibiotics are frequently prescribed and have been found in some studies to provide subjective benefit, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against their routine use based on high quality trials.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

### Delayed antibiotics for symptoms and complications of respiratory infections [^114VHnXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections is controversial. Any benefits have to be weighed against common adverse reactions (including rash, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting), cost and antibacterial resistance. There has been interest in ways to reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections. One is delaying the use of prescribed antibiotics by more than 48 hours for acute upper respiratory tract infections. Such methods have been shown to reduce prescribing. This review asks what effect this practice has on the clinical course of the illness.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effect of delayed antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections compared to immediate use of antibiotics

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Groups' specialised register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1 2004), EMBASE (1990 to September 2003) and Current Contents (1998 to 2003). The search was carried out by an expert librarian. Abstracts of identified articles were used to determine which studies were trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving patients of all ages defined as having acute otitis media, acute pharyngitis, sore throat, common cold, a viral upper respiratory tract infection, acute sinusitis, and acute bronchitis were included in which delayed antibiotics are compared to antibiotics used immediately. Delayed antibiotic use was defined as the use of or advice to use antibiotics more than 48 hours after the initial consultation. 'Immediate antibiotic use' was defined as the immediate use of oral antibiotics given at the initial consultation. Clinical outcomes measured included: the presence or absence of fever, cough, pain, duration and severity of illness, complications of the disease, adverse effects from the antibiotics. Trial quality was assessed independently by two reviewers who were blinded to the author, journal and results of each study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was collected by two reviewers who were blinded to the author and journal. Data were analysed and reported using RevMan.

Main Results

Seven trials were eligible on the basis of design and all reported patient-centred outcomes. Methodological quality of included trials was generally high. There was no difference between immediate and delayed antibiotic groups for symptoms on day one and day seven. For most symptom measures there was no significant difference between the immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. Missing data and marked heterogeneity between study outcomes prevented pooling of results as a meta-analysis. Three studies out of six reporting fever, all involving patients with sore throat, indicated that there was more fever in the delayed antibiotic group. The remaining three studies showed no difference. There was no significant symptom difference for patients with cough or the common cold between the two intervention groups. Pain and malaise severity scores at day three significantly favoured the immediate antibiotic group in children with acute otitis media (Little 2001). In this study by Little 2001 of children with otitis media proxies for other malaise related outcomes were reported, including 'last day of crying' which favoured the immediate antibiotic group by approximately 16 hours (0.69 days; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.07). In the same study, just over half a spoon of paracetamol a day less was used in the immediate antibiotic group (0.59; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.93). There was no significant difference between the intervention groups for the adverse outcome of rash. Two studies reported the outcome of vomiting which was reduced in the immediate antibiotic group in children with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis in El-Daher 1991 but there was no difference in children with sore throat in Little 1997. Diarrhoea was reported by three studies of which two showed no difference Little 1997; Arroll 2002a while Little 2001 reported less diarrhoea in the delayed antibiotic group in children with otitis media.

Reviewers' Conclusions

When considering treatment options for upper respiratory tract infections, the option of delayed antibiotics has been used in an attempt to reduce the use of antibiotic prescriptions. This review shows that for all symptom scores the evidence varies between trials. Most symptom outcomes show no difference between immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. Three of the six studies, all involving patients with sore throat, indicated that patients in the delayed antibiotic group had significantly more fever that their counterparts in the immediate antibiotic group. The other three showed no difference for the outcome of fever. There is evidence indicating that for children with otitis media, pain and malaise scores are worse in the delayed antibiotic group compared to the immediate antibiotic group. This price must be weighed up against the benefits of reduced antibiotic prescribing. Future randomised controlled trials of delaying antibiotics as an intervention should fully report symptoms as well as changes of prescription rates.

Antibiotic safety and patient instructions — immunocompetent adults with pulpal- and periapical-related dental infection: Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose; clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for C. difficile infection, which can be fatal. Patients who receive azithromycin should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while receiving therapy, and patients should be instructed to call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or 3 loose bowel movements per day. An antibiotic with a similar spectrum of activity to those recommended above can be continued if initiated before treatment, and as with any antibiotic use, the patient should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^112V4VUL]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics Key Action Statement 5B — For children with confirmed acute bacterial sinusitis who have worsening symptoms or fail to improve in 72 hours, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment for the child initially managed with observation (Evidence Quality: D; Option based on expert opinion, case reports, and reasoning from first principles). For patients whose symptoms are mild and have failed to improve but have not worsened, initiation of antimicrobial agents or continued observation (for up to 3 days) is reasonable. If caregivers report worsening of symptoms at any time in a patient for whom observation was the initial intervention, the clinician should begin treatment as discussed in Key Action Statement 4. If caregivers report worsening of symptoms after 3 days in a patient initially treated with antimicrobial agents, current signs and symptoms should be reviewed to determine whether acute bacterial sinusitis is still the best diagnosis; if sinusitis remains the best diagnosis, infection with drug-resistant bacteria is probable and an alternate antimicrobial agent may be administered, and face-to-face reevaluation is desirable.

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up, discontinuation, preferences, and safety notes for adjunctive antibiotics with DCDT: "DCDT refers to pulpotomy, pulpectomy, nonsurgical root canal treatment, or incision for drainage abscesses". The panel advises "Clinicians should reevaluate within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call)" and "Dentists should instruct patients to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after their symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d". Among first-line options, "amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects". Cautions include "Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose", and "clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal". Patients receiving azithromycin "should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while on therapy", and patients should "call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d". The text also notes "If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed. If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic outside of the spectrum as the one indicated, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed, considering potential contraindications".

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116ZsM2N]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

End-points in exacerbation trials

Analysis of any study should critically examine if its end-points were adequate to demonstrate the potential benefits of the intervention being tested and were clinically relevant. Unfortunately, in the studies evaluated by Puhan et al, as well as in the vast majority of antibiotic comparison trials in exacerbations of COPD, end-points used favor the demonstration of equivalence rather than differences among the arms (Table 2). Partly, this is the result of mandates (now obsolete) by regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These end-points assessed at 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms and the initiation of therapy miss differences in therapeutic effect earlier during the course of treatment. In addition, these end-points have minimal relevance to clinical practice. In clinical practice, most physicians and patients expect clinical improvement in their exacerbation at 3 to 5 days after initiation of treatment. In fact, with insufficient improvement in that timeframe, therapy is often altered or expanded. Allegra et al did conduct a placebo-controlled trial where they used a 5-day time-point, showing a substantial benefit of antibiotics, which was excluded from the analysis by Puhan et al.

Limitations of published placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Reproduced with permission from Sethi.

The adequacy of the traditional goals of treatment of an exacerbation, recovery to baseline clinical status and the prevention of complications, are being questioned because of several new observations. These include realization of the importance of exacerbations in the course of COPD, the role of infection in exacerbations, the high rates of relapse with an adequate initial clinical response, and the role played by chronic infection in the pathogenesis of COPD. Today, confining our goal in the treatment of COPD exacerbations to short-term resolution of symptoms would be analogous to treating acute myocardial infarction with the only aim being resolution of chest pain.

Table 3 lists several other important goals of treatment, both clinical and biological, that should be considered. In fact, the FDA wants precise symptom measurement with a patient-reported outcome measure as the major end-point of future studies of antibiotics in exacerbations. Practical application of the biological goals of treatment of exacerbations should be feasible in the future with ongoing development of simple, rapid and reliable measurements of inflammation and infection.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^116acWNg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING SUPPRESSIVE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY

Selecting Patients for Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

There are 2 broad categories of patients who may be started on SAT. The first is in patients who have failed primary treatment of their infection. Failure is characterized by persistence of clinical infection or infectious biomarkers after the indicated surgery and intravenous antibiotic course.

The second group is patients who are not candidates for the indicated surgical (with intravenous antibiotic) route. These patients are typically frail, highly comorbid, with limited life expectancy. In these patients, the role of suppressive antibiotic therapy is weighed against the risk of aggressive surgical interventions, to provide more satisfactory patient outcomes.

The transition from a prolonged oral curative course to one with suppressive intent is not always clear; in our previous studies we have considered oral courses initially prescribed with an intended duration over 1 year to be suppressive therapy.

Monitoring Patients on Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

We recommend monitoring patients receiving SAT more frequently in the initial year after commencing therapy, and then every 6 months or annually once the patient's clinical and biochemical signs of infection have normalized. Evidence suggests that patients are more likely to fail SAT early in the treatment course; thus, more frequent monitoring is warranted over this period.

Duration of Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

Some authors have demonstrated that continuing SAT beyond 1 year does not continue to reduce the risk of treatment failure. In our experience, cessation of SAT can be considered if the following criteria are met. The patient should have stable inflammatory markers (eg, white blood cell count, ESR, and CRP) within normal reference ranges for at least 1 year, without clinical signs of infection such as ongoing pain or discharge from a prosthetic joint site. If appropriate baseline imaging exists, the infected site should be re-imaged to compare disease activity. Finally, patient preference should be at the forefront of the decision to cease SAT. Patient factors to consider are how well the patient has tolerated SAT, what is the patient's life expectancy, and how devastating infection recurrence would be for that patient. In frailer patients, with limited life expectancy in whom an infection recurrence may prove fatal, it may be reasonable to continue SAT indefinitely.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^113YmJTW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — modification of therapy: The efficacy of the therapeutic regimen is judged primarily by the clinical response, and the results of cultures and sensitivity testing may have an impact on therapeutic decision-making, especially if the patient does not respond to initial therapy. When the patient is improving, therapy need not be adjusted solely on the basis of laboratory studies, and dual antibiotic treatment designed to achieve broad-spectrum coverage may become unnecessary once the causative organism has been isolated. In general, the initial therapeutic regimen should be modified when the eye shows a lack of improvement or stabilization within 48 hours, while keratitis due to Pseudomonas and other gram-negative organisms may exhibit increased inflammation during the first 24 to 48 hours despite appropriate therapy. Several clinical features suggest a positive response to antibiotic therapy: Reduced pain, Reduced amount of discharge, Reduced eyelid edema or conjunctival injection, Consolidation and sharper demarcation of the perimeter of the stromal infiltrate, Decreased density of the stromal infiltrate in the absence of progressive stromal loss, and Reduced stromal edema and endothelial inflammatory plaque.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^111SCEVi]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These results support the hypothesis that treating painful LUTS with long-term antimicrobial courses is effective. These data support a mounting body of evidence that painful LUTS may have an infectious aetiology when dipstick and microbiological culture results do not indicate disease. The standard laboratory tests used to diagnose infection were positive only in a small proportion of the clinic's symptomatic population (< 20%). This result is not surprising as we do not use MSU cultures to initiate treatment, and the insensitivity of urine culture is now well recognised.

An unplanned cessation of treatment in an unselected group of patients with chronic painful LUTS managed with protracted antimicrobial courses was coincident with a measurable deterioration in symptoms. The reintroduction of the original treatment regimen was associated with improvement. Only 24-h urinary frequency was unaffected. Arguing against a mere placebo effect or a by-product of the stress induced by the clinic suspension, the inflammatory biomarker pyuria mirrored the rise and fall of symptoms in these patients. Similarly, shed urothelial cell counts, which are known to reflect a host innate response to inflammation, moved in concert with the other variables, thus supporting a growing awareness of their ability to reflect the disease process.

A subset of the patients was hospitalised during the suspension period, and the underlying reasons for admission highlight worsening urinary infection, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis, in the face of antibiotic withdrawal. These events point to potentially significant consequences when patients receiving antibiotic therapy for presumed chronic infection have their treatment suddenly withdrawn without access to treatment reinstatement. It should be noted that all but one of these patients had remained free of hospital admissions whilst under the care of the service and receiving treatment.

To date, a limited number of RCTs support longer-term antibiotic treatment for painful LUTS caused by chronic infection. The current data are not from an RCT, but they resulted from a random withdrawal of treatment followed by reinstating the same treatment. These circumstances provide credible observational data from a cross-over process. As well as corroborating the earlier RCTs, they are in agreement with our own previous observational data demonstrating improvements associated with treatment. Our earlier paper also reported high relapse rates related to planned trials without treatment. These data suggest that presumed chronic infection may require much longer antibiotic courses than are recommended for other urological infections. The next step is a RCT using these data as proof of concept.

ABRS/ARS identification and initial therapy — Suspect ABRS in patients in whom a URI persists beyond 10 days and/or show worsening after initial improvement; a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, and facial pain correlates with increased likelihood of bacterial disease (Rec, A). Treat for ABRS if symptoms last longer than 10 days or with recrudescence of symptoms after progressive improvement (Rec, B). To avoid resistance and potential adverse effects from antibiotics, the workgroup recommends evaluation of β-lactam allergy by penicillin skin testing and/or graded oral challenge if β-lactam is the most appropriate antibiotic for ABRS (Rec, B). Use intranasal steroids for treatment of ARS as monotherapy or with antibiotics (Rec, B).

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

If initial defenses fail, "inflammation ensues, leading to alveolar consolidation of varying intensities", with symptoms that "such as fever, productive cough, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia develop", and although "most patients recover with antibiotic treatment, some develop severe disease that can be fatal".

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

Antibiotic duration guidance for acute bacterial arthritis indicates that shorter courses are appropriate when there is rapid clinical improvement with a consistent, progressive decrease in CRP by the end of the first week of treatment, whereas longer courses, such as 21 to 28 days, are reasonable when clinical improvement and reduction of the systemic inflammatory response occur more slowly.

### Immediate versus delayed versus no antibiotics for respiratory infections [^1113PHUr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on duration and/or severity of clinical outcomes (pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea), antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

From May 2017 until 20 August 2022, this was a living systematic review with monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 August 2022. Due to the abundance of evidence supporting the review's key findings, it ceased being a living systematic review on 21 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages with an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

For this 2022 update, we added one new trial enrolling 448 children (436 analysed) with uncomplicated acute RTIs. Overall, this review includes 12 studies with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 are available for analysis. These 12 studies involved acute RTIs including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study) and a variety of RTIs (two studies). Six studies involved only children, two only adults and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in primary care, four in paediatric clinics and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported and appeared to provide moderate-certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcome assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analyses for pain, malaise, fever, adverse effects, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. Cough (four studies): we found no differences amongst delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in any of the four studies. Sore throat (six studies): for the outcome of fever with sore throat, four of the six studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and four found no difference. Two studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Acute otitis media (four studies): two studies compared immediate with delayed antibiotics - one found no difference for fever, and the other favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. Two studies compared delayed with no antibiotics: one found no difference for pain and fever severity on Day 3, and the other found no difference for the number of children with fever on Day 3. Common cold (two studies): neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study found delayed antibiotics were probably favoured over no antibiotics for pain, fever and cough duration (moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Effects

there were either no differences for adverse effects or results may have favoured delayed over immediate antibiotics with no significant differences in complication rates (low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic use: delayed antibiotics probably resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; 8 studies, 2257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, a delayed antibiotic was probably more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.75; 5 studies, 1529 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: patient satisfaction probably favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.45, 1.08 to 1.96; 5 studies, 1523 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in patient satisfaction between delayed and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1927 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Reconsultation rates and use of alternative medicines were similar for delayed, immediate and no antibiotic strategies. In one of the four studies reporting use of alternative medicines, less paracetamol was used in the immediate group compared to the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (30% versus 93%). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (13% versus 27%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with RTIs, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in not prescribing antibiotics, delayed antibiotics may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Further research into antibiotic prescribing strategies for RTIs may best be focused on identifying patient groups at high risk of disease complications, enhancing doctors' communication with patients to maintain satisfaction, ways of increasing doctors' confidence to not prescribe antibiotics for RTIs, and policy measures to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

The antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with pain, scoliosis, persistently inflammatory markers, high fever, extreme pain, or positive blood, sputum, throat, or urine cultures. Empirical treatment focuses on S. aureus, the most common organism isolated from culture-positive biopsy specimens. There are no absolute recommendations regarding the duration of antibiotic treatment. Initial treatment is with parenteral antibiotics (range 1–8 weeks), and if there is clinical and experimental evidence of patient response to antibiotic therapy, the antibiotic therapy continues with oral antibiotics (range 3–6 months). Yagdiran A. et al. (2022) announced that because the most common cause of infection in spondylodiscitis is Staphylococcus aureus and it takes time to get the blood culture result, physicians start the empirical treatment based on the antibiotic covering for Staphylococcus aureus after taking the culture sample. Antibiotic treatment has been different in each region, and it is prescribed based on the disease's severity and the child's age; conversely, there is no specific guideline for treating spondylodiscitis in patients. Hence, doctors start the treatment based on common infection pathogens and bacterial resistance in their region.

Immobilization using bed rest, a cast, or a brace has usually been recommended, and it decreases pain and minimizes deformity in patients. Relative rest and immobilization can be used along with antibiotics to improve spondylodiscitis. In a study by Chandrasenan J. et al. (2011), they did not prescribe antibiotics to patients without infectious clinical symptoms who had negative blood cultures and normal white blood cell counts. They were treated only with bracing, recovered completely, and had no problems in the follow-up periods. They recommend spinal bracing without antibiotics when children are systemically well with a normal WBC count and a negative blood culture.

Surgical debridement should only be considered in rare patients with documented abscesses with a systemic disease or ongoing neurological deficits, significant destruction of the vertebral bodies, progressing to rapid transformation of the deformity into kyphosis, spinal instability, or failure of conservative treatment.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^1153T2cq]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients without a penicillin allergy who do not respond to first-line therapy: Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients without a penicillin allergy fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral amoxicillin or oral penicillin V potassium, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1167djHn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1164iXc9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 6 — treatment failure for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, the clinician should change the antibiotic; the recommendation is based on expert opinion and first principles for changing therapy with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with an action statement profile citing quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade D with use of rescue antibiotic in RCTs, level of confidence in evidence moderate, benefits of preventing complications, detecting missed diagnosis, and instituting effective therapy, and risks or costs including delay in changing therapy if the patient fails to improve and medication costs.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^117R6kXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 February 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 February 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 26 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. A grey literature search was conducted using OpenGrey (to 26 February 2018) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 26 February 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. A fixed-effect model was used in the meta-analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the United States and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. The patients included in these trials had no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables reported in both studies were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects, as reported in one study, were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). Neither study reported quality of life measurements. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessTwo studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth, while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessWe found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1137FsEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the United States, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9). Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3).

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^112Jryey]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — Key Action Statement 5A states: "Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening (progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) OR failure to improve (lack of reduction in all presenting signs/symptoms) within 72 hours of initial management (Evidence Quality: C; Recommendation)". "Worsening" is defined as progression of presenting signs or symptoms or onset of new signs or symptoms, and "Failure to improve" is lack of reduction in presenting signs or symptoms by 72 hours after diagnosis and initial management; patients with persistent but improving symptoms do not meet this definition. KAS Profile 5A notes "Aggregate evidence quality: C; observational studies" and "Strength Recommendation", with benefits including "Identification of patients who may have been misdiagnosed, those at risk of complications, and those who require a change in management", and a harm of "Delay of up to 72 hours in changing therapy if patient fails to improve".

### Delayed antibiotics for respiratory infections [^1174L1vX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions but to advise delay in the hope symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007 and updated in 2010.

Objectives

To evaluate the use of delayed antibiotics compared to immediate or no antibiotics as a prescribing strategy for ARTIs. We evaluated clinical outcomes including duration and severity measures for pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea in sore throat, acute otitis media, bronchitis (cough) and the common cold. We also evaluated the outcomes of antibiotic use, patient satisfaction, antibiotic resistance and re-consultation rates and use of alternative therapies.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to February Week 3 2013); Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (28 February 2013); EMBASE (1990 to 2013 Week 08); Science Citation Index - Web of Science (2007 to May 2012) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 28 February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of all ages defined as having an ARTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to antibiotics used immediately or no antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted and collected data. Important adverse effects, including adverse effects of antibiotics and complications of disease, were included as secondary outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information where available.

Main Results

Ten studies, with a total of 3157 participants, were included in this review. Heterogeneity of the 10 included studies and their results generally precluded meta-analysis with patient satisfaction being an exception. There was no difference between delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for the clinical outcomes evaluated in cough and common cold. In patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and sore throat immediate antibiotics were more effective than delayed for fever, pain and malaise in some studies. There were only minor differences in adverse effects with no significant difference in complication rates. Delayed antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics. A strategy of no antibiotics resulted in least antibiotic use. Patient satisfaction favoured immediate antibiotics over delayed (odds ratio (OR) 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.76). Delayed and no antibiotics had similar satisfaction rates with both strategies achieving over 80% satisfaction (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.10). There was no difference in re-consultation rates for immediate and delayed groups. None of the included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

Most clinical outcomes show no difference between strategies. Delay slightly reduces patient satisfaction compared to immediate antibiotics (87% versus 92%) but not compared to none (87% versus 83%). In patients with respiratory infections where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use, while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics.

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^113RYVG6]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors for surgical site infection can be patient related (eg, age, comorbid disease, nutritional status) or procedure related (eg, complexity, surgical technique, antibiotic prophylaxis, glycemic control). Various guidelines provide recommendations on the prevention of infection at the surgical site, which include maintaining strict perioperative blood glucose control, adequate perioperative oxygenation, normothermia, normovolemia, and the use of various surgical related strategies to mitigate risk. Although no prospective studies have yet evaluated the association between perioperative infection prevention and persistent postsurgical pain, infection control should remain a cornerstone of perioperative care.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^117Ws9n8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis — management of incomplete response and escalation: For resolved uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, no further evaluation is needed, but for partial response clinicians should continue antibiotic treatment for another 10 to 14 days or consider a different antibiotic. For poor response, which worsens after 3 to 5 days, consider broadening microbial coverage or switch to a different antimicrobial that covers resistant bacteria, and rhinosinusitis that fails to improve after 21 to 28 days of initial antibiotic treatment might be due to pathogens not adequately covered by prior antibiotics, nasal polyps, tumor, or noncompliance. Reinforce comfort and prevention measures, consider a sinus CT scan if not already done with more detailed evaluation of underlying risk factors, and consider consultation with an allergist‑immunologist or an otolaryngologist for immunodeficiency, unusual pathogens, allergic factors, or structural abnormalities.

Group A streptococcus

In acute rheumatic fever, oropharyngeal group A streptococcus infection triggers an autoimmune response resulting in inflammation and organ damage. Most patients who develop rheumatic fever are aged between 5 and 15 years, with Streptococcus pyogenes being the most implicated bacterial strain. In one large database study of 1470 children, 50% of rheumatic fever hospital admissions presented with primary arthritis without carditis, 26% presented with arthritis and carditis, 24% presented with chorea, and 6.5% showed both chorea and carditis. Recurrences are common in rheumatic fever, especially in younger individuals. Considered by many to be a prototypical autoimmune condition, rheumatic fever can manifest as a prolonged pain syndrome that includes reactive polyarthritis, skin involvement, carditis, vasculitis, and chorea, which might result in associated neurologic symptoms including pain. About 5% of patients with untreated, group A streptococcus pharyngitis develop rheumatic fever, with early antibiotic treatment reducing the risk substantially. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to prevent recurrences.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^1156AdH2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115uv8ic]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic Therapy for ABRS Following Initial Treatment Failures — In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), if a patient on antibiotics worsens or fails to improve within 3 to 5 days, drug-resistant infection should be considered and therapy switched with reevaluation; when changing therapy, clinicians should consider initial coverage limits, as amoxicillin-treated patients commonly have beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (60%), M. catarrhalis (58.3%), or penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (72%). Resistance can be significant, with minimum inhibitory concentration at least 2-fold higher observed in 49% of patients. For multidrug-resistant pathogens, options would include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g per day amoxicillin equivalent) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternative agents are available, but given the FDA black box warning regarding fluoroquinolones, the decision to use this class should be carefully thought out; oral cephalosporins and macrolides are predicted to offer inadequate coverage for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Safety and follow-up are emphasized: patients who fail antibiotics with a worsening pattern should be examined for complications and, if concerning findings are present, an urgent referral to an otolaryngologist or emergency department is warranted and CT sinuses, or MRI is indicated; a follow-up plan should be made between clinicians and patients.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^116TE3rZ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^113DW4FB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and within the community as a whole.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 October 2013). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) on 1 October 2013 to identify ongoing trials. We searched for grey literature using OpenGrey (to 1 October 2013) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 1 October 2013). We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the United States and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo given in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth (no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise)). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables presented were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects as reported in one study were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). No studies reporting quality of life measurements were suitable for inclusion. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. Two studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114Rs9Za]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^113zjyLA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the United States, Canada and Australia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2012), Current Contents (1966 to November 2012), CINAHL (2008 to November 2012) and LILACS (2008 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 12 RCTs (3317 children and 3854 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible. However, one trial did not report patient-relevant outcomes, leaving 11 trials with generally low risk of bias. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20) and fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95; NNTB 20). When compared with placebo, antibiotics did not alter the number of abnormal tympanometry findings at either four to six weeks (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) or at three months (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24), or the number of AOM recurrences (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10). However, antibiotic treatment did lead to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral AOM episodes (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) as compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) were eligible. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis on pain at days three to seven. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic group or the expectant observation group. Additionally, no difference in tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence was observed. Immediate antibiotic prescribing was associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash as compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of children with AOM experiencing pain at two to seven days compared with placebo but since most children (82%) settle spontaneously, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one suffering from ear pain at two to seven days. Additionally, antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (NNTB 33) and contralateral AOM episodes (NNTB 11). These benefits must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics had been withheld. Antibiotics appear to be most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease, an expectant observational approach seems justified. We have no trials in populations with higher risks of complications.

### Imaging does not predict the clinical outcome of bacterial vertebral osteomyelitis [^113zoSpB]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful for initial assessment of bacterial spondylodiscitis. However, clinical relevance of imaging changes during treatment is less well-documented.

Methods

Between October 1997 and March 2005, 29 patients with documented bacterial spondylodiscitis were prospectively enrolled. They had clinical, biological and imaging examinations (MRI and/or CT) at M0 and M3, and in 22 cases, at M6.

Results

Mean age was 58 yrs. Antimicrobial chemotherapy lasted an average of 98 days. The median follow-up was 18 months, including 12 months after the completion of treatment. Infection was cured in every patient. Biological markers of inflammation returned to normal at M3. Six patients had painful and/or neurological sequelae. Decreased disc height was a consistent and early sign, and remained stable during the follow-up. Vertebral oedema, present in 100% of cases initially, persisted in 67 and 15% of cases at M3 and M6, respectively. Discal abscesses and paravertebral abscesses, present in 65 and 39% of cases initially, persisted in, respectively, 42 and 9% of cases at M3 and in 18 and 3% of cases at M6. Epidural abscesses were present at diagnosis in 30% of cases, and had always disappeared by M3. Imaging abnormalities found at M0 and M3 did not differ between patients with and without late neurological or painful sequelae.

Conclusions

Imaging abnormalities often persist in patients with bacterial spondylodiscitis despite a favourable clinical and biological response to antibiotic treatment. They are not associated with relapses, neurological sequelae or persistent pain. Imaging controls are not necessary when bacterial spondylodiscitis responds favourably to treatment.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease-United States [^111xLYzG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The term "chronic Lyme disease" is used by some health care providers as a diagnosis for various constitutional, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been provided a wide range of medications as treatment, including long courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Studies have not shown that such treatments lead to substantial long-term improvement for patients, and they can be harmful. This report describes cases of septic shock, osteomyelitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and paraspinal abscess resulting from treatments for chronic Lyme disease. Patients, clinicians, and public health practitioners should be aware that treatments for chronic Lyme disease can carry serious risks.

Lyme disease is a well-known condition caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Features of early infection include erythema migrans (an erythematous skin lesion with a bull's-eye or homogeneous appearance), fever, headache, and fatigue. If left untreated, the spirochete can disseminate throughout the body to cause meningitis, carditis, neuropathy, or arthritis. The recommended treatment for Lyme disease is generally a 2–4-week course of antibiotics.

Chronic Lyme disease, on the other hand, is a diagnosis that some health care providers use to describe patients with a variety of conditions such as fatigue, generalized pain, and neurologic disorders. Many of these patients have experienced significant debilitation from their symptoms and have not found relief after consultation with conventional medical practitioners. As a result, some seek treatment from practitioners who might identify themselves as Lyme disease specialists ("Lyme literate" doctors) or from complementary and alternative medicine clinics, where they receive a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.

A diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease might be based solely on clinical judgment and without laboratory evidence of B. burgdorferi infection, objective signs of infection, or a history of possible tick exposure in an area with endemic Lyme disease. There is a belief among persons who support the diagnosis and treatment of chronic Lyme disease that B. burgdorferi can cause disabling symptoms even when standard testing is negative, despite evidence that the recommended two-tiered serologic testing is actually more sensitive the longer B. burgdorferi infection has been present (6). Some practitioners use tests or testing criteria that have not been validated for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A significant concern is that after the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is made, the actual cause of a patient's symptoms might remain undiagnosed and untreated.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^1118BtKs]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Early clinical response in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: from clinical endpoint to clinical practice [^116mob4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

OPTIC was a global, phase III, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, noninferiority CABP study (Figure 1). It compared 7–14 days of omadacycline at 100 mg IV every 24 hours (q24h; initial 2 doses were every 12 hours [q12h]), including an option to transition to 300 mg orally q24h after 3 days of treatment, or moxifloxacin at 400 mg IV q24h, including an option to transition to 400 mg orally q24h after 3 days of treatment. Adults aged ≥ 18 years of age with ≥ 3 protocol-specified CABP symptoms (cough, production of purulent sputum, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain); abnormal vital signs; laboratory abnormalities associated with CABP; disease categorized as being Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV at screening; and radiographically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled. Full entry criteria for this study and an overview of causative pathogens have been published previously.

Figure 1.
OPTIC study design. Abbreviations: CABP, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; IV, intravenous; OPTIC, Omadacycline for Pneumonia Treatment In the Community.

The ECR primary efficacy endpoint was programmatically defined as symptom improvement at 72–120 hours after the first dose of study drug, no use of rescue antibiotics, and patient survival. CABP symptoms were characterized using a 4-point scale (absent, mild, moderate, or severe) by the investigator. Symptom improvement was defined as ≥ 1 level improvement (eg, severe to moderate) in ≥ 2 CABP symptoms, with no worsening by ≥ 1 level in other CABP symptoms.

Investigator assessment of clinical response was determined at the PTE (5–10 days after the last dose of study drug). Clinical success at PTE was defined as survival with resolution or improvement in signs and symptoms of infection and with no need for further antibacterial therapy.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute otitis media in children [^116iHUR6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common acute infection in children. Pain is its most prominent and distressing symptom. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for AOM, although they have only a modest effect in reducing pain at two to three days. There is insufficient evidence for benefits of other treatment options, including systemic corticosteroids. However, systemic corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs, and so theoretically could be effective, either alone or as an addition to antibiotics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids (oral or parenteral), with or without antibiotics, for AOM in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane ARI Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and LILACS (BIREME) for published studies, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for completed and ongoing studies, to 20 February 2018. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references and contacted experts in the field to identify additional unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children with AOM that compared any systemic corticosteroid (oral or parenteral) with placebo, either with antibiotics (corticosteroid plus antibiotic versus placebo plus antibiotic) or without antibiotics (corticosteroid versus placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (EDS, RR, YP) independently screened the titles and abstracts and retrieved the full texts of potentially relevant studies. We independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed study quality using the GRADE method.

Main Results

We included two studies involving 252 children with AOM aged from three months to six years receiving hospital ambulatory care who were treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone, and who were then randomised to the corticosteroid group (corticosteroid and corticosteroid plus antihistamine) or the placebo group (antihistamine and double placebo). In one study, children also had a needle aspiration of middle ear fluid. Both studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, and unclear to high risk of bias for selective reporting. One study (N = 179) included pain as an outcome, but we were unable to derive the proportion of children with persistent pain at Day 5 and Day 14. Reduction of overall or specific symptoms was presented as improvement in clinical symptoms and resolution of inflamed tympanic membranes without the need for additional antibiotic treatment: at Day 5 (94% of children in the treatment group (N = 89) versus 89% in the placebo group (N = 90); risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.16) and Day 14 (91% versus 87%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17). Low-quality evidence meant that we are uncertain of the effectiveness of corticosteroids for this outcome. The second study (N = 73) reported a reduction of overall or specific symptoms without additional antibiotic treatment during the first two weeks as a favourable outcome. Children in the treatment group had more favourable outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 65.9, 95% CI 1.28 to 1000; P = 0.037), although the numbers were small. We were unable to pool the results with the other study because it did not report the proportion of children with this outcome by treatment group. Only one study reported adverse effects of corticosteroids (e.g. drowsiness, nappy rash), but did not quantify incidence, so we were unable to draw conclusions about adverse effects. Neither study reported a reduction in overall or specific symptom duration.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the effect of systemic corticosteroids on AOM is of low to very low quality, meaning the effect of systemic corticosteroids on important clinical outcomes in AOM remains uncertain. Large, high-quality studies are required to resolve the question.

### Back pain as the initial presentation of subacute bacterial endocarditis in a patient with a complex medical history [^112uD1Xb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) poses a diagnostic challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations, especially among high-risk groups. Diagnosis relies on integrating clinical presentation, blood cultures and imaging findings. Advanced imaging techniques enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in complex cases. Treatment involves antimicrobial therapy and surgery in complicated cases, with early intervention crucial for optimal outcomes. Coordinated care by an Endocarditis Team ensures tailored treatment plans, prompt complication management and long-term monitoring after discharge. The authors present a case of subacute IE presenting initially with back pain in a patient with a complex medical history, highlighting diagnostic and management approaches.

Patient A

A woman in her late 30s with fatigue and joint pain received a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Bartonella infection by a local physician. Despite multiple courses of oral antibiotics, her symptoms worsened, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed for initiation of IV antibiotic treatment. After 3 weeks of treatment with IV ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, the patient's joint pain continued, and she developed fever and rash. She became hypotensive and tachycardic and was hospitalized in an intensive care unit, where she was treated with broad spectrum IV antibiotics and required mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Despite maximal medical support, she continued to worsen and eventually died. The patient's death was attributed to septic shock related to central venous catheter–associated bacteremia.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — when to suspect: Clinicians should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and fever (strong, low), should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and elevated ESR or CRP (strong, low), and should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and bloodstream infection or infective endocarditis (strong, low); clinicians may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with fever and new neurologic symptoms with or without back pain (weak, low) and may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with new localized neck or back pain, following an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (weak, low). Supporting evidence notes diagnostic delay with an average time to diagnosis of 2–4 months and initial misdiagnosis in 34% of 101 patients; fever is only present in up to 45% of patients with bacterial NVO; in a series of 253 patients with bacterial NVO, 43% had epidural or paravertebral extension; an elevated ESR or CRP result in patients with back pain has a sensitivity that can range from 94% to 100%; and up to 40% of patients with NVO have a normal white blood cell count.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^117Rncy4]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management. If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116nN3yj]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

### Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: should we use antibiotics and if so, which ones? [^113QQbbj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence suggesting at least 50% of exacerbations involve bacteria that benefit from antibiotic treatment. Here, we review the most relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD and provide insights on the selection of initial antibiotic therapy for their treatment.

Recent Findings

Identification of bacterial exacerbations still relies on clinical assessment rather than laboratory biomarkers. Several recent studies, including a meta-analysis and placebo-controlled trials, demonstrate improved outcomes with antibiotics in all but mild exacerbations of COPD, including both inpatient and outpatient. A broader antibiotic regimen should be used for patients who have risk factors for poor outcomes. A risk-stratification approach can guide antibiotic choice, although the stratification algorithm still needs to be validated in a randomized controlled trial.

Summary

The use of antibiotics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe suspected bacterial exacerbations in COPD is supported by published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews. Recent trials also show differences in outcomes based on antibiotic choice. More research is necessary to evaluate risk stratification approaches when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^113r3Bma]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — therapy for complicated cases emphasizes correcting coexisting risk factors and using adjunctive procedures when eye integrity is threatened. Coexisting risk factors, such as eyelid abnormalities, should be corrected to get the best results, and additional treatment is necessary in cases with an extremely thin cornea, impending or frank perforation, progressive or unresponsive disease, or endophthalmitis. Oral antibiotics in the tetracycline class (including doxycycline and minocycline) and N-acetylcysteine could be used to counteract corneal stromal thinning, but there are limited data on their use. Application of tissue adhesive, penetrating keratoplasty, and lamellar keratoplasty are among options for progressive stromal thinning, and the application of an amniotic membrane could be considered to decrease inflammation and stabilize the ocular surface. One randomized controlled trial found that double-layer amniotic membrane transplantation 2 to 5 days after initiation of topical antibiotics improved visual acuity at 6 months but did not improve corneal healing time, hypopyon size or duration, or depth of corneal opacity. Another controlled study applied single-layer amniotic membrane after 2 to 3 days of antibiotic therapy in culture-proven Pseudomonas keratitis; it found decreased pain postoperatively, decreased density of corneal opacity, and better uncorrected visual acuity compared with a control group who received only antibiotics. Amniotic membrane transplantation and conjunctival flap may be used in cases refractory to medical treatment, Tenons patch graft with cyanoacrylate glue can be an effective option for larger perforations, and tectonic Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty has been an alternative to tectonic penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty for perforation.

### Vancomycin [^115M96x7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Prostatitis: a review [^113Vvw95]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0–43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo = -10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

Neutropenic fever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — episode classification and empiric spectrum are described as follows: An "initial" episode refers to the first episode of neutropenic fever requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy, whereas a "persisting episode" is "persistent neutropenic fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy beyond days 4–7", and episodes may also be recurrent. During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

### Analysis of diagnoses, symptoms, medications, and admissions among patients with cancer presenting to emergency departments [^112Sn2Tj]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Poorly controlled pain was also frequently present in the week before the ED visit, with almost half of those reporting quite a bit or very much pain not receiving outpatient opioids. A significant opportunity therefore exists to improve pain control in the ED and outpatient settings, which could improve quality of life and avoid ED visits and hospital admissions. Improvements could include pragmatically designed clinical pathways that are primarily developed by emergency medicine physicians, in collaboration with oncology and palliative care colleagues, to improve symptom control and ensure adequate administration of analgesia. Given the low proportion of patients receiving palliative care services at time of ED visit (8.0%), the opportunity for additional intervention in these patients before prior to the ED visit is substantial.

Dyspnea and nausea were frequently present. Dyspnea is a particularly worrisome and challenging symptom because it may represent many causes of life-threatening pathologic conditions (eg, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cardiac tamponade, pleural effusion, pneumonitis) that, after disease progression, are leading causes of death in patients with cancer. The frequent presence of dyspnea as well as the broad differential diagnosis of life-threatening conditions likely contributes to high testing and admission rates. For nausea, ED and outpatient treatment appear to be suboptimal. This finding provides additional opportunities to improve quality of life and outpatient and ED management and develop care plan processes facilitating outpatient rather than inpatient care.

Suspicion of bacterial infection was also common. Although only 14.4% of participants had a recent or an ED-measured fever, blood and urine cultures were obtained in 255 (23.7%; 95% CI, 21.2%-26.4%), and antibiotics were administered in 26.5%. Participants receiving antibiotics were admitted at a higher rate than those not receiving antibiotics. Although some antibiotic recipients probably did not have acute bacterial infections, the paradigm of timely antibiotic administration in at-risk populations without a priori evidence of acute bacterial infection accounts for the antibiotic use observed in this population where 465 participants (43.3%; 95% CI, 40.3%-46.3%) recently received chemotherapy. Although only a small percentage (2.4%) of our cohort were found to have febrile neutropenia (a rate similar to that in prior ED studies), concern for this condition and the urgency to minimize time to antibiotics for these participants may have increased empirical antibiotic administration rates in febrile individuals who were ultimately found not to have neutropenia.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease-United States [^115jir2p]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Patient C

A woman in her late 40s received multiple arthropod bites and subsequently developed a flu-like illness with pain in her arms, legs, and back. One year after her symptoms began, she received a diagnosis of Lyme disease using the recommended two-tiered serologic test (positive enzyme immunoassay test result followed by positive immunoglobulin G Western immunoblot). She was treated with two 4-week courses of oral doxycycline.

The patient developed fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and poor exercise tolerance, and 2 years after her initial diagnosis she received a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease based on the results of unvalidated tests. She was treated with intramuscular penicillin for approximately 5 weeks without improvement, then IV ceftriaxone for 4 months, followed by IV azithromycin for 6 months administered via a tunneled IV catheter.

One year later, she received additional IV ceftriaxone via a new IV catheter, plus oral doxycycline, tinidazole (an antiparasitic medication), and azithromycin for approximately 4 weeks. The patient developed back pain, shortness of breath, and malaise, and was hospitalized. The catheter was removed, and blood and catheter tip cultures yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She was treated with aztreonam for 4 weeks; however, her back pain worsened, and she was readmitted to the hospital. A computed tomography scan indicated destruction of both the 9th and 10th thoracic vertebrae, and magnetic resonance imaging of her spine confirmed osteodiscitis. A bone biopsy and culture grew P. aeruginosa with the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as her previously diagnosed bacteremia. She was treated for osteodiscitis, and her back pain eventually improved.
