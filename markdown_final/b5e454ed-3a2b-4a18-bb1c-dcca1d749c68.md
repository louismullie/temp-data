how to treat eoe

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should outline evidence-based induction options with practical dosing and technique. Next, I will define how to assess response objectively. After that, I need to specify maintenance strategies and surveillance. Finally, I should address refractory disease, including optimization, dilation, and biologics, while integrating cost and multidisciplinary considerations for shared decision-making [^1111vPNU] [^1156BUEb].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and baseline assessment, because if I misclassify GERD or other mimickers, everything downstream becomes shaky. EoE requires symptoms of esophageal dysfunction plus at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field on biopsy after considering non-EoE causes, and I should obtain at least six biopsies from two levels, document endoscopic features using a validated score, and record symptoms and adaptive behaviors given their poor correlation with histology [^117RxzeH] [^113P2hkZ] [^116ZQyA4] [^1138NRP3]. Hold on, I should also verify fibrostenotic risk at baseline because strictures may require adjunctive dilation in parallel with anti-inflammatory therapy, not as a substitute for it [^1164Tb3f] [^111smPFa].

> Next, I will select an induction strategy, but wait, let me verify that three first-line modalities are acceptable and can be individualized. Current guidance supports high-dose PPIs, swallowed topical corticosteroids, or empiric elimination diets as equivalent induction options, chosen via shared decision-making that accounts for age, phenotype, cost, access, and preference, with a plan to reassess objectively after 8–12 weeks [^113KpsYZ] [^1111vPNU] [^112ZvtdA]. I need to ensure I discourage allergy testing to direct diet because it is not predictive of EoE triggers, and I should keep that explicit to avoid missteps in care pathways [^116m5CuQ] [^111xMozM].

> I will now examine PPI induction, and I should double-check dose and expected effect sizes. High-dose PPI (for example, omeprazole 20–40 mg twice daily in adults or 1–2 mg/kg/day in children) for at least 8 weeks induces histologic remission in roughly 45–50% and clinical response in about two-thirds of patients, with higher remission rates at double versus standard doses and reasonable durability on half-dose maintenance, independent of GERD status [^111gn2mS] [^114qfKmq] [^1167wsiS]. Let me verify that I commit to objective reassessment after induction with endoscopy and biopsies to confirm remission, because symptoms alone can mislead me [^113KpsYZ].

> Now, for swallowed topical corticosteroids, I should confirm both efficacy and technique details. Fluticasone propionate or budesonide reliably achieve histologic remission and even complete remission versus placebo, with budesonide showing stronger signal for symptom relief in some analyses, and administration after meals or at bedtime with nothing by mouth for 30–60 minutes maximizes esophageal dwell time and effectiveness [^115DFugd] [^1131MEjp] [^1126TMd2]. Wait, let me verify safety points: oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis can occur but is usually asymptomatic and treatable without stopping steroids, while the risk of adrenal suppression is low but warrants selective monitoring during longer courses [^115F1Dgd] [^113AnDgT].

> For empiric dietary elimination, I need to ensure a practical step-up approach with dietitian support. Starting with one- or two-food elimination, commonly dairy alone or dairy plus wheat, is preferred initially, escalating to six-food or elemental diets only as needed, with structured reintroduction and endoscopic confirmation to identify triggers [^112ZvtdA] [^113Uaxy2] [^113bjJDR]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about test-directed diets, because both ACG 2025 and AGA 2020 discourage using skin or serum IgE testing to guide elimination in EoE due to poor predictive value, and I should clearly state that to avoid ineffective strategies [^116m5CuQ] [^11123YRG].

> Next, I should review how to assess induction response, since relying on symptoms risks missing ongoing inflammation and fibrostenotic progression. The primary endpoint is histologic remission defined as fewer than 15 eosinophils per high-power field, with an aspirational target of fewer than 5, complemented by improvement in endoscopic scores and symptom metrics, typically reassessed after 8–12 weeks; persistent symptoms with histologic remission should prompt evaluation for motility or other non-EoE etiologies [^117RxzeH] [^1131MEjp] [^116ZQyA4] [^114XsRJP]. Wait, let me verify monitoring cadence guidance to ensure alignment with expert recommendations for structured follow-up beyond the induction window [^112MaNYW].

> If remission is achieved, I will transition to maintenance because EoE relapses commonly and disease control prevents remodeling. Maintenance can continue with the effective induction modality, such as halved-dose PPI or the lowest effective steroid dose, or sustained trigger-food avoidance, with individualized endoscopic-histologic surveillance generally every 1–3 years in stable patients and sooner if symptoms recur [^1156BUEb] [^117FjB2j] [^111gn2mS] [^114XsRJP] [^112ZvtdA] [^112VPRML]. I should confirm safety monitoring, including selective screening for adrenal insufficiency in those on prolonged topical steroids, to balance efficacy and risk over the long term [^113AnDgT].

> Manage nonresponse methodically, but first, I need to check for fixable reasons for failure. Hold on, I should verify adherence, especially correct steroid slurry or spray technique and NPO timing, ensure adequate PPI dosing and duration, confirm the diagnosis with adequate biopsies, and re-evaluate for strictures or alternative contributors like dysmotility before declaring pharmacologic failure and escalating therapy [^116SFj6e] [^113P2hkZ] [^1126TMd2]. If strictures are present, I should combine stepwise endoscopic dilation with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy, using a start-low, go-slow approach to target a functional lumen diameter while minimizing risk [^111smPFa] [^1139ifNb] [^115e42La].

> For refractory disease after optimizing first-line care, I will now consider escalation strategies, and I should double-check the role of biologics. Dupilumab is the first FDA-approved therapy for EoE and is appropriate for patients who are inadequately controlled on, intolerant to, or not candidates for conventional therapy, within a multidisciplinary framework that continues objective monitoring for remission and safety over time [^112qJ1zN] [^112vgcew] [^117LAJbf]. Let me reconsider combination strategies as well, acknowledging that while data are limited, combining modalities can be appropriate in selected patients to achieve control, provided we still anchor decisions to histologic and endoscopic outcomes rather than symptoms alone [^116SFj6e] [^112MaNYW].

> But wait, what if resource constraints or patient preferences shape the initial choice — am I accounting for costs and access alongside efficacy. Shared decision-making is crucial because costs accrue from repeated endoscopies, specialty compounding for steroids, and specialized diets; a patient-centric approach that weighs effectiveness, feasibility, and monitoring burden tends to improve adherence and outcomes, especially with step-up dietary strategies that minimize restrictions initially [^1173MxPt] [^112ZvtdA] [^113t3RGS]. I need to ensure allergists are engaged when helpful for comorbidity management and education, even though we avoid using allergy tests to select EoE diet eliminations, to support comprehensive care and longitudinal monitoring [^1157Kbov] [^116m5CuQ].

> Lastly, safety and quality signals deserve explicit attention, so let me verify key pitfalls to avoid. Topical steroid candidiasis is usually mild and manageable, proper NPO timing after dosing reduces washout, and H2 blockers should not be used as EoE therapy given lack of efficacy, despite their observed real-world first-line use in some cohorts, underscoring the need for adherence to guidelines and quality metrics that emphasize objective response assessment [^115F1Dgd] [^1126TMd2] [^116c4f9u] [^11183TD3]. I should double-check that the follow-up plan documents histology, endoscopy, and symptoms together at each decision point to avoid the common trap of symptom-only management in this chronic, progressive, type 2 inflammatory disease [^117RxzeH] [^112MaNYW].

Treat EoE with a **stepwise approach**: start with high-dose PPIs [^113KpsYZ] [^112hyWyP]; add swallowed topical corticosteroids [^1111vPNU] [^1146fUJL] if needed; and use empiric 1- or 2-food elimination diets with dietitian support and structured reintroduction [^112ZvtdA] [^11123YRG]. Reserve **esophageal dilation** for strictures causing dysphagia [^111smPFa], and consider **biologics** such as dupilumab for refractory disease [^112vgcew] [^1157Kbov]. Monitor with periodic **endoscopy and biopsies** [^112MaNYW] [^115DFugd], and continue effective therapy long term to prevent recurrence [^1156BUEb] [^112qJ1zN].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

- **First-line therapy**: High-dose PPIs [^113KpsYZ] [^112hyWyP] are recommended to induce remission in EoE.
- **Mechanism**: PPIs reduce eosinophilic inflammation via acid suppression [^115DFugd] and anti-inflammatory effects [^113txqnx].
- **Efficacy**: Clinical response in ~65% and histologic remission in ~45% of patients [^111gn2mS].
- **Maintenance**: Use the lowest effective dose [^117FjB2j] [^114qfKmq] to maintain remission.

---

### Swallowed topical corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Use fluticasone propionate or budesonide [^1111vPNU] [^1146fUJL] if PPIs are inadequate.
- **Administration**: After meals or at bedtime; nothing by mouth for 30–60 minutes to maximize dwell time [^1126TMd2].
- **Efficacy**: Histologic remission in ~65% [^115DFugd] of patients [^114V8Q93].
- **Maintenance**: Continue the lowest effective dose long term [^117FjB2j] [^114XsRJP].

---

## Dietary therapy

- **Empiric elimination diets**: Start with less restrictive 1- or 2-food elimination (milk, wheat) [^112ZvtdA] [^113Uaxy2] [^11123YRG].
- **Dietitian support**: Essential for adherence and nutrition [^112ZvtdA] [^11183TD3].
- **Structured reintroduction**: Reintroduce foods sequentially with endoscopic assessment [^112ZvtdA] [^113bjJDR].
- **Elemental diets**: Highly effective but limited by palatability and cost [^111WyRmS] [^11123YRG].

---

## Endoscopic dilation

Endoscopic dilation [^111smPFa] is **indicated for strictures causing dysphagia** unresponsive to medical therapy; use a **gradual, low-caliber** approach to minimize perforation risk [^115e42La], and combine dilation with **anti-inflammatory treatment** [^1139ifNb] [^112qJ1zN].

---

## Biologic therapy

Within biologic therapy, **Dupilumab** [^1157Kbov] is considered for refractory EoE and targets the IL-4/IL-13 pathways [^112vgcew], while **other biologics**, such as anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-13 agents, are under investigation [^1164qQU7] [^112vgcew].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular endoscopy with biopsies** [^115DFugd] to assess response [^112MaNYW]. Continue **effective therapy** [^112qJ1zN] to prevent recurrence [^1156BUEb]. For patients on long-term corticosteroids, **monitor for adrenal insufficiency** [^113AnDgT] [^115F1Dgd].

---

## Special considerations

**Pediatric patients** follow a similar approach [^112ZvtdA], with milk elimination as a first-line diet [^113t3RGS]. **Refractory EoE** should prompt reassessment of the diagnosis and adherence, with consideration of biologics or combination therapy [^116SFj6e] [^112vgcew].

---

EoE management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1157Kbov] using PPIs, topical corticosteroids, dietary therapy, and dilation, with biologics for refractory cases and regular monitoring to maintain remission [^115DFugd].

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^115xaMd6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Inflammation and the resulting symptoms of esophageal dysfunction in eosinophilic esophagitis are thought to result from the penetration of the esophageal mucosa by food or aero-antigens, leading to a cellular response and symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. A breach in the integrity of the esophageal epithelium, potentially facilitated by gastric acid exposure and/or genetic variants compromising epithelial barrier function, allows the ingress of food or aeroallergens, leading to the initiation of an immune response. Interleukins produced by activated Th2 cells can act directly to recruit eosinophils to the esophagus (IL-5) or can stimulate the epithelium to express inflammatory genes (IL-4/IL-13), including eotaxin-3, by activation of cell surface receptors that signal through a pathway involving JAKs and STAT6. Esophageal eosinophilia in eosinophilic esophagitis is driven largely by STAT6-dependent local expression of eotaxin-3.

Medical therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis have targeted esophageal inflammation broadly with corticosteroids, or targeted biologic mediators, including anti-IL5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab), anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL4r (dupilumab), anti-IL13 (RPC4046, alias cendakimab; QAX576, alias dectrekumab), and anti-sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 8 (lirentelimab). The proposed mechanism of PPI therapy is by gastric acid suppression leading to a restoration of esophageal barrier function and unrelated PPI-mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Elimination diets have been used since the initial description.

### Italian EoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^112VPRML]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

For patients in remission on maintenance therapy, with the aim of avoiding negative effects in terms of compliance and improving patient retention, EoExperts state that, after the first year of therapy, endoscopic and histological follow-up could be scheduled every 1–3 years.

Finally, EoExperts agreed on the need for an algorithm as a guiding management tool for EoE patients. All shared and agreed recommendations were integrated and turned into an algorithm that could be followed for proper therapeutic decision-making, evaluation of control, and follow-up in the context of EoE.

- **Figure 5**: 2024 Italian EoExpert Panel Disease Control & Switching Criteria (D.C.S.C.) algorithm for adult and pediatric patients. As first-line therapies, confirmed EoE patients will be treated with a dietary approach, PPI, TCS, and/or approved biological therapies. Endoscopic esophageal dilation could also represent an add-on therapy before switching for those patients with histological control of the disease who do not achieve clinical remission. After the first induction therapy evaluation (3–6 months), if EoE is defined as adequately controlled, the patient still remains in continuous maintenance therapy. Therapy evaluations are thus performed with endoscopic and histological follow-up (1 year and then after 1–3 years in the absence of symptoms). Only if endoscopy and histology findings do not confirm that EoE is still adequately controlled should a continuous therapy switch be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^117RxzeH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for eosinophilic esophagitis, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing EoE based on the presence of symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (hpf) on esophageal biopsy. This diagnosis should be made after evaluating for non-EoE disorders that could cause or potentially contribute to esophageal eosinophilia.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^1138NRP3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

With the rising prevalence and incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and as diagnosis requires the identification of esophageal eosinophilia, an emerging challenge in management is disease monitoring. Since symptoms of EoE are not consistently reliable in correlating with disease activity, monitoring commonly necessitates repeated endoscopy with biopsies. The development of minimally invasive monitoring tests for disease activity in EoE is an area of active investigation. Non-invasive tests such as the esophageal string test and Cytosponge are currently being evaluated. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers, including plasma EDN, CCL26, and eosinophil progenitor levels, are also under investigation for disease monitoring in EoE.

The focus of EoE treatment remains the alleviation of symptoms and the prevention of complications from fibrostenotic remodeling. The mainstays of effective treatment for EoE include proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), various elimination diets, and topical corticosteroids such as swallowed fluticasone inhaler and oral viscous budesonide. Dietary and pharmacologic therapies effectively induce and maintain disease remission, reduce the risk of esophageal food impactions, and improve quality of life. Recently, several corticosteroid formulations, including fluticasone orodispersible tablet, budesonide oral solution, and budesonide orodispersible tablet, have been developed to specifically treat EoE. Some of these esophagus-targeted formulations of topical steroids have demonstrated excellent response rates.

### Cost-effective care in eosinophilic esophagitis [^1173MxPt]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to examine costs related to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), understand the sources of these costs, discuss a possible approach for cost-effective care in EoE, and identify areas for future research on this topic.

- **Data sources/study selections**: Narrative review of the literature from 1977 (first description of EoE) to March 2019, focusing on costs and cost-effectiveness analyses in EoE.

- **Results**: High costs in EoE can be related to diagnostic delays, the requirement for upper endoscopy with biopsy for diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity, expensive medications currently used off-label, increased food costs due to dietary elimination treatment, frequent doctor visits with subspecialists, and complications or disease exacerbations. Provision of cost-effective care in EoE is an understudied area, where a patient-centric approach is key. There are multiple areas in which future research can make an impact, including determining predictors of treatment response, minimally or noninvasive methods to monitor disease activity, and validation of the use of multidisciplinary care.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is considered a rare disease, but the costs of care and the burden of disease attributed to EoE are substantial. However, few studies examine either the costs related to EoE or the approach to cost-effective care for the EoE patient. To provide cost-effective care, a patient-centric approach and shared decision-making model are optimal. In addition, a rational strategy for EoE diagnosis and initial treatment, as well as effective maintenance therapy, are necessary.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^1131MEjp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

With more than 1000 patients enrolled in RCTs worldwide, STC can be considered the best-studied drug class in EoE. The superiority of fluticasone propionate over placebo to induce clinical and histological remission of EoE, and any other formulation of STC, has been corroborated in numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses involving RCTs carried out in children and adults over the last two decades.

Despite slight differences in defining histological remission across the different studies, both budesonide and fluticasone propionate are shown to be significantly superior to placebo in reducing peak eosinophil densities below the diagnostic threshold of 15 cells/hpf (odds ratio, OR = 24.6, 95% confidence interval, CI = 7–86.8). They achieve complete histological remission (< 6 eosinophils/hpf; OR = 35.82, 95% CI = 14.98–85.64) and restore a normal endoscopic appearance in EoE (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 1.47–8.36). However, a uniform and convincing remission of symptoms could not be demonstrated in all cases, mainly because several trials used non-structured or validated instruments to assess EoE symptoms.

Differences in drug effectiveness have also been demonstrated: a systematic review found budesonide significantly superior to placebo in terms of symptomatic relief (OR = 7.20, 95% CI = 2.15–24.05) but not fluticasone propionate (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.44–3.65). The variable drug dosages used in the different RCTs, and specifically the different drug administration methods used to deliver STC inside the esophageal lumen, explain the reported differences.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, specifically concerning dietary modifications, AGA 2020 guidelines recommend considering the following dietary interventions in patients with EoE:

- **Elemental diet**: An approach where patients consume an amino acid-based formula that provides the necessary nutrients without allergens.

- **Empirical six-food elimination diet**: Involves removing six common allergenic food groups from the diet — dairy, wheat, eggs, soy, nuts, and seafood.

- **Allergy testing-based elimination diet**: Dietary adjustments are made based on the results of allergy testing to identify specific food triggers.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^113bjJDR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The evolving approach to empirical elimination diets consists of eliminating from patients' diets those foods more commonly associated with food allergies, irrespective of allergy testing results. This strategy was first assessed by Kagalwalla and colleagues in 2006. They simultaneously removed the six most common food antigens related to allergy — milk, wheat, egg, soy, nuts, and fish and seafood — from patients' diets for a period of six weeks. Three out of four patients achieved histological remission with results similar to those achieved with elemental diets, indicating that at least one of the eliminated foods was a trigger for the disease.

Identifying specific triggers was accomplished by sequential food reintroduction and endoscopy with biopsy after each reintroduction. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the so-called six-food elimination diet (6-FED) provided the most consistent results for patients of all ages. Specifically, 70% of them were able to achieve histological remission of EoE after food avoidance.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: Epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^117LAJbf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic type 2 inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by eosinophilic infiltration into its tissue. Studies on EoE endotypes suggest that the condition might progress over time. Common symptoms in adult patients include dysphagia, food impaction, heartburn, and chest pain. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and arises from a complex interaction among genetic, intrinsic, and environmental factors, as well as antigenic stimuli. Diagnosis relies on a comprehensive evaluation of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and biopsy results.

Managing EoE requires a multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterologists, allergists, and pediatricians. Treatment options encompass elimination diets, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), swallowed topical corticosteroids (TCSs), and, if clinically relevant strictures persist despite initial therapies, esophageal dilation. While broad consensus exists on these initial therapies, some patients do not respond adequately to treatments. Therefore, there is a need for effective therapies targeting the underlying inflammatory processes to induce and sustain disease remission. One promising novel therapy for EoE is Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that modulates the activity of key cytokines involved in EoE development — interleukins 4 (IL-4) and 13 (IL-13).

Since 2017, there have been no updates to the management strategies for EoE in Italy. However, it is noteworthy that the latest British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Guidelines from 2022 have integrated the most recent findings.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113wM5Co]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

- **Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**: In a number of our primary outcomes in key groups of treatments, high- and moderate-certainty evidence has been synthesized. However, there are several issues with the overall evidence from the included studies, which limits our ability to draw convergent conclusions to inform clinical practice and decision-making.

There are limited studies specifically in children, often with high clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Most studies used mixed groups of adolescents and adults, but the data were combined. This not only limits the applicability to younger children but also limits the completeness of the evidence in the adolescent age group.

The first primary outcome was clinical symptom improvement as defined by the individual study, but the assessments varied widely, with a lack of consistent validated, patient-reported outcomes. This limited the scope for meta-analysis and in turn reduced certainty, particularly in the pediatric setting. The limited data set in children makes it difficult to determine whether a lack of efficacy for these outcomes reflects issues with different symptomatology, the validity and reliability of such measures or instruments in children, or underlying poor efficacy. A similar point can be made about the adult studies. This is a key clinical question across all patient ages and so limits the applicability of these outcomes. Ideally, a single validated clinical outcome would be used across studies to facilitate data pooling and comparison of results.

### Dietary elimination therapy is an effective option for adults with eosinophilic esophagitis [^111tFmnt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an immune-mediated disorder. Food elimination is an established treatment for children, but data in adults are limited. The study aimed to determine the response of adults with EoE to dietary therapy.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study using the University of North Carolina EoE database from 2006 to 2012. Subjects were age 18 and older, diagnosed with EoE by consensus guidelines, and had undergone dietary therapy with either a targeted elimination diet or a 6-food elimination diet (SFED). Outcomes assessed included symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic improvement, along with demographic, endoscopic, symptomatic, and laboratory predictors of response to dietary therapy.

- **Results**: Of 31 adults who underwent dietary therapy (mean age 36 years; 48% male; 90% white; mean baseline eosinophil count of 78 eos/hpf), 22 had a targeted elimination diet, and 9 had SFED. Symptoms improved in 71% of participants (68% in targeted, 78% in SFED), and endoscopic appearance improved in 54% (53% in targeted, 56% in SFED). After dietary therapy, the mean eosinophil count decreased to 43 eos/hpf (P = 0.009). Eleven subjects (39%) responded with fewer than 15 eos/hpf (32% in targeted and 56% in SFED; p = 0.41). No clinical, endoscopic, or histologic factors predicted response to dietary therapy. Of the 11 responders, 9 underwent food re-introduction to identify triggers, and 4 (44%) reacted to dairy, 4 (44%) to eggs, 2 (22%) to wheat, 1 (11%) to shellfish, 1 (11%) to legumes, and 1 (11%) to nuts.

- **Conclusions**: Dietary elimination is a successful therapy for adults with eosinophilic esophagitis, although individual responses to specific food triggers vary.

### Combination steroid and test-based food elimination for eosinophilic esophagitis: A retrospective analysis [^117GTmDa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Primary treatment approaches for eosinophilic esophagitis include topical corticosteroids or food elimination, both of which are effective as single treatment options. The combination of topical corticosteroids with specific food elimination has been shown to achieve clinical and histological remissions as effectively as single treatment approaches.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune- or antigen-mediated clinicopathologic disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration (≥ 15 eosinophils [eos]/high-power field [hpf]). Among pediatric patients, the incidence of EoE is 0.7 to 10 cases per 100,000 children. Infants and toddlers typically present with feeding difficulties, whereas school-aged children generally exhibit vomiting and abdominal pain. Teenagers usually present with dysphagia, epigastric pain, and food impaction. If left untreated, EoE can progress to serious conditions, such as dysphagia and esophageal strictures, in adulthood. These EoE-related conditions are associated with significant morbidity. Thus, effective and early treatment of pediatric EoE is critical for preventing long-term esophageal problems.

- **Primary treatment options**: EoE treatment options include topical corticosteroids, food elimination, and elemental diets. High-dose topical corticosteroids and specific elimination diets are effective in improving symptoms, reducing esophageal eosinophilic mucosal infiltrates, and enhancing endoscopic markers of inflammation. Allergic comorbidities are found in 42% to 93% of pediatric patients, with food allergies being the most prevalent.

### Current updates in diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^115Jx2o6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a relatively new and moderately well-understood disease. It stands as one of the leading causes of dysphagia in the pediatric population. Thought to be triggered by food ingestion, it is distinctly different from food allergies. Although endoscopy is required for diagnosis, this article reviews warning signs and symptoms that aid with the evaluation and diagnosis of this disease. Treatment modalities and management are evolving, and more research is needed.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1164qQU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

In 2010, a previous version of this review was published with only three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). As of 2022, the number of published RCTs for pediatric and adult eosinophilic esophagitis that meet our inclusion criteria has grown to 41, with approximately half completed in the past five years. Given the rapid pace of clinical trial publications for eosinophilic esophagitis and changing outcome metrics, prior publications appear outdated, even those as recent as 2020. As an example, a recent American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) technical review of eosinophilic esophagitis management reported nine corticosteroid trials compared to 14 and four biologic clinical trials compared to nine. Another example is the European guidelines, which included even fewer RCTs as they were published three years earlier.

The AGA technical review clearly employed GRADE, and when RCTs were synthesized, the broad findings were similar. However, the certainty broadly increased in our review in key highly studied areas (biologics and non‐systemic steroids) due to enhanced quality of reporting and precision.

A recent UK joint adult and pediatric national consensus guideline, which considered a similar body of evidence, did state alignment with GRADE methodology. However, no technical review details are presented, and in several key areas of management, the GRADE of evidence included in this review does not match what is reported. For example, several forms of diet therapy are not aligned with the GRADE presented in this review.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^114XsRJP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Corticosteroids (CS) are effective in maintaining remission; discontinuation of treatment generally leads to a relapse within a few weeks. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, histologic remission was maintained with 880 mcg/day of fluticasone propionate (FP) in 73% of children who had undergone induction with 1760 mcg/day. Similarly, in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults, remission was maintained in 36% of patients taking 0.5 mg/day of budesonide suspension for 50 weeks. Differences in maintaining remission between children and adults should be interpreted with caution because the mentioned data are not directly comparable.

- **Dietary interventions**: Since food antigens are implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), diet modification is the only therapeutic approach targeting the cause of the disease. Potentially, prolonged avoidance of trigger foods may lead to sustained clinical and histologic remission. Strategies to identify the culprit foods to induce and maintain remission include an elemental diet, an empiric elimination diet, and a food allergy testing-guided elimination diet.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: An allergy and immunology perspective on the updated guidelines [^1157Kbov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

In January 2025, the American College of Gastroenterology published updated guidelines on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). These new guidelines incorporated updated information on the pathophysiology, risk factors, natural history, and treatment of EoE. They were primarily intended for practicing gastroenterologists; therefore, we summarize their key recommendations for the allergy and immunology community.

As the prevalence and health care burden of EoE continues to increase, and with the population affected primarily comprising allergic individuals, less invasive monitoring techniques are on the horizon. We discuss key means by which allergists can contribute to the diagnosis and management of EoE. In particular, allergists can participate in screening for subtle EoE symptoms among their allergy patients, assist in optimizing the management of other allergic comorbidities, provide education about elimination diets, and facilitate the monitoring of disease over time. Allergists are uniquely poised to treat the entire allergic individual, rather than just the allergic esophagus, and should be prepared to co-manage these patients along with gastroenterologists.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Update on management and controversies [^117BfCSx]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic allergen-driven, immune-mediated disease increasingly recognized as a leading cause of dysphagia and foregut symptoms in both children and adults. Recent years have seen significant advancements in understanding the genetic and environmental risk factors associated with this disease, the inflammatory environment it creates, and the long-term complications arising from esophageal remodeling.

This review highlights the recent progress made in research, with a focus on adult cases. Ongoing efforts are being made to develop minimally invasive techniques that may eliminate the need for repeated endoscopic assessments of disease activity. Additionally, studies employing novel tools like mucosal impedance and functional lumen imaging are being reviewed as potential surrogate markers for assessing mucosal integrity and esophageal remodeling.

Regarding the treatment of eosinophilic inflammation, we discuss the controversies surrounding the responsiveness to proton pump inhibitors among certain patients. Therapeutic trials support the use of topical glucocorticoids and empiric food elimination diets as first-line treatments. Efforts are ongoing to optimize the elimination diet protocol to reduce the level and duration of food restrictions.

Looking forward, our expanding knowledge of the pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis is paving the way for the development of promising targeted biologic therapies.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114V8Q93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The review considered all types of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion, excluding quasi-randomized trials (those using no or inappropriate randomization).

- **Types of participants**: Individuals of any age diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis were included, whether they had active disease (characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, at least 15 eos/hpf, on esophageal biopsy, along with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction) or inactive disease. No restrictions were applied regarding sex, disease duration, or previous medication exposure.

	- We included studies that had only a subset of eligible participants if this subset was planned for subgroup analysis. The impact of these subsets was explored through methods described in the subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity. If a subgroup analysis had not been planned, the authoring team discussed whether further subgroup analysis was necessary and how it could affect the planned outcomes.

- **Types of interventions**: The review examined studies comparing any medical intervention such as topical corticosteroids, biologic therapy, systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, epicutaneous immunotherapy, and proton pump inhibitors, or food elimination diets like empiric elimination diet and elemental diet. These interventions were considered both alone and in combination with other interventions.

Regarding medical management for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, particularly in the context of corticosteroids, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of oral systemic corticosteroids to induce remission. This should be done following a thorough discussion with the patient and parents about the benefits and risks involved.

### Steroids versus dietary therapy for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113RENqp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a condition characterized by dense mucosal eosinophilia in conjunction with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Since both the incidence and prevalence of EoE are on the rise in both children and adults, understanding the various treatment options available is imperative in choosing the proper treatment for each patient. This article highlights the major strides in both medical and dietary treatment of EoE in the past year.

- **Recent findings**: Whereas prior studies have shown that medical therapy with topical corticosteroids is effective in treating EoE, this more recent literature highlights some of the limitations of this approach, raising awareness that the development of better drug delivery models is greatly needed. The review also describes the recent advances in the field of dietary therapy for this disease, particularly in adults, and further supports the notion that the pathophysiology of this disease in children and adults is similar, with food antigens driving this disease.

- **Summary**: Both medical and dietary therapy are effective for treating adults and children with EoE. Choosing the optimal treatment approach should be individualized based on both patient goals and available local resources. Future prospective clinical trials comparing these two treatment modalities are needed to understand comparable effectiveness, identify potential predictors of response to treatment, and determine optimal therapeutic endpoints.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^114cw4rC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Shortly after the description of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), corticosteroids with reduced bioavailability (beclomethasone and budesonide), when swallowed instead of inhaled, were proven to be as effective as systemic steroids in inducing clinical and histological remission of the disease in a small series of four children. Later on, fluticasone propionate also provided evidence of effectiveness in treating EoE, and mometasone furoate was recently added to the list of drugs with potential benefit in this disorder.

An RCT compared swallowed topical corticosteroids (STCs) with oral prednisone: after four weeks of treatment, both options were shown to have equivalent effectiveness in inducing clinical and histological remission of EoE. Systemic corticosteroids presented no advantages in terms of symptom resolution, relapse rates, or time to relapse, but had significantly more severe adverse effects. Therefore, systemic steroids are generally not recommended in EoE and have been replaced by topical corticosteroids to treat EoE.

### Treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis [^111xMozM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

To summarize dietary and pharmacologic approaches in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), recent studies comparing dietary approaches in EoE treatment support empiric elimination diets as the preferred method. There is no data to support the use of currently available allergy tests to guide specific food elimination diets. Swallowed topical corticosteroid therapy is the standard of care in pharmacologic EoE treatment, with fluticasone and budesonide showing similar effectiveness. However, discontinuation of these treatments results in the return of both EoE symptoms and disease.

A number of nonsteroid-based therapies are currently under investigation for the treatment of EoE, focusing on targeting the disease at a cellular level. EoE can be treated with diet or medications, with empiric elimination being the preferred dietary approach. Swallowed steroids are the standard medication treatment for EoE, but there are several promising drugs currently undergoing clinical trials.

### Emerging therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis [^114pLTbQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the pathologic understanding of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), no single agent has yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat EoE. Currently, EoE is treated off-label using the "3 Ds": drugs (particularly swallowed topical corticosteroids), dietary restriction, and endoscopic dilation.

- **Recent progress**: Considerable progress has been made in EoE treatment:
	1. New EoE-specific steroid formulations optimizing mucosal deposition have been developed, culminating in the recent approval of a budesonide effervescent tablet in Europe.
	2. Biologics used for other TH2-mediated diseases, such as allergic asthma and atopic eczema, as well as purpose-developed biologics, have been studied in phase II trials in patients with EoE.
	3. Novel dietary restriction strategies have evolved.

Further insights into the pathogenesis of EoE have revealed several novel disease mediators that might be targeted in the future. In the following article, we will discuss recent advances in EoE treatment with regard to swallowed topical steroids, biological agents, dietary approaches, and novel molecular targets.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^112qJ1zN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long-term treatment critical. Treatment goals for eosinophilic esophagitis include improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Standard treatment modalities for eosinophilic esophagitis include dietary, pharmacologic, and endoscopic interventions.

- **Dietary therapy**: Involves empiric food elimination (most commonly milk protein) through dietary elimination and/or formula. Although effective, this approach can result in several endoscopies initially and be challenging to sustain long-term.
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Includes proton pump inhibitors, topical glucocorticoids, and rapidly emerging biologics, including the first U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication for eosinophilic esophagitis.
- **Endoscopic intervention**: Esophageal dilation is effective in relieving symptoms such as dysphagia; however, it does not alter the underlying inflammation. This therapy is often used in conjunction with diet and/or medication.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic disease that requires ongoing therapy and long-term monitoring. If left untreated, it can result in complications such as fibrostenosis and strictures of the esophagus.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: Epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^114uVaBP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Tailoring treatment to each patient's specific needs based on factors like age, symptom severity, and comorbidities is crucial. This consideration should encompass therapeutic approaches and novel biologic therapies displaying promising efficacy and patient safety. Regular follow-ups and monitoring are equally essential to assess treatment effectiveness, identify potential complications, or make necessary therapy adjustments.

This study had two main limitations. First, there is a significant lack of evidence in the literature concerning the epidemiology and management of EoE in Italy. To address this gap, a survey was administered, although expert opinion cannot fully compensate for the absence of context-specific epidemiological studies.

Second, despite being administered to EoE disorder experts, the survey was influenced by the inherent subjectivity of their responses, representing a second limitation of this study. Moreover, in addressing the limitations of our study, it is important to note that the survey was administered to a highly heterogeneous group of physicians. This diversity, while enriching the breadth of perspectives collected, also introduces a limitation as the survey did not investigate in depth the specific training physicians received on EoE, their experience in managing EoE patients, and the duration of their engagement in this field. Acknowledging this, our findings may not fully reflect the nuanced understanding and approaches that vary with different levels of expertise and experience in EoE management.

### Proton pump inhibitors for inducing and maintaining remission in eosinophilic esophagitis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gn2mS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy results in clinical and histological remission in approximately 50% of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) patients. We aimed to systematically update this topic due to cumulative data from pediatric and adult populations in wider geographical settings.

- **Methods**: A search in MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases was performed. The primary outcomes were clinical response and histological remission, defined as less than 15 eosinophils per high-power field. Subgroup analyses included age group, PPI drug and dosage, study design, data origin, and risk of bias. Data were pooled using random-effects models.

- **Results**: Seventy-three studies comprising 7304 patients were included. PPI therapy led to a clinical response in 65% (95% confidence interval, 57.2%-72.4%; I² = 0%) and histological remission in 45.4% (95% CI, 41.6%-49.3%) of patients, without significant differences between children and adults (41.2% vs. 48%; P < .17). Overall, 34.1% (95% CI, 27.9%-40.5%) achieved less than 5 eosinophils per high-power field. Pooled effectiveness was significantly superior (P < .001) in Western Pacific areas, principally Japan (67.9%), compared to American and European areas (40.6% and 44.4%, respectively). Histological remission was significantly higher with double PPI doses compared to standard doses (51.7% vs. 28.3%; P < .005). Response was significantly higher in studies with a lower risk of bias. Maintenance half-doses led to sustained histological remission in 68.2% (95% CI, 63.7%-72.6%; I² = 0%) of patients.

- **Conclusions**: PPI therapy induces clinic-histological remission in almost half of the EoE patient population across various demographics and geographies.

### Strategies for medical management of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis [^113Fp9Bq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is associated with significant morbidity in children, making strategies for optimizing its outcomes essential. This study aimed to review the strategies for medical management of EoE in children.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medical interventions in children with EoE was conducted using the Cochrane methodology. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Library, and Google Scholar were searched up to March 2016. Primary outcomes included histological (peak eosinophil count) and symptomatic remission. Secondary outcomes were improvement in endoscopic and other histological parameters and adverse effects.

- **Results**: A total of 5 RCTs (N = 448) with low to unclear risk of bias were included. The interventions examined were topical oral steroids, swallowed enteral steroids, and an anti-interleukin (IL)5 agent. Pooling of data from all trials was not possible due to significant heterogeneity in interventions. Meta-analysis of data (N = 141) from 3 RCTs (oral viscous budesonide: 2, fluticasone: 1) showed significant histological remission in the intervention versus control group participants (risk difference: 10.32 [95% confidence interval: 3.04, 35.03]; P = 0.0002), with the level of evidence being low. Compared with anti-IL5 agent, the trials assessing steroids reported high rates of clinical remission. Clinical remission did not correlate with histological improvement in any trial. Except for systemic corticosteroids, there were no significant adverse effects related to other interventions.

- **Conclusions**: Strategies involving different steroids showed varying levels of clinical and histological effectiveness. Further research may be required to conclusively determine effective interventions without major side effects.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^111WyRmS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Despite being one of the most effective therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), capable of achieving rapid histological remission at times within 2 weeks, the multiple drawbacks of avoiding all types of food other than an artificial formula quickly proved limited in clinical practice. Being unappealing led to poor compliance, with some adult patients abandoning the diet on the first day, and many small children requiring nasogastric tube delivery to ensure a proper intake of calories. Exclusive elemental diet feeding also carries significant psychological and social difficulties, as well as diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL). An additional barrier for its implementation is the high cost of elemental formulas not being universally reimbursed by insurance companies.

Finally, long-term avoidance of solid food in children under 2 years old or with known feeding dysfunction may lead to delayed oral-motor skill development. Even when successful in inducing remission, the dietary reintroduction process after elemental diet therapy is lengthy and requires multiple endoscopies with biopsies and several months of continued nutritional support while a normal diet is gradually returned. All this significantly reduces the real possibility of using exclusive elemental diets in clinical practice as a bridge therapy for highly refractory infants and toddlers while waiting for investigational drugs, as well as for patients who wish to remain in remission while investigating the causal role of unusual foods and aeroallergens in their disease. Flavored formulas are recommended, and so is the combining of elemental formula with solid foods.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^116DPHZk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Long-standing untreated eosinophilic inflammation in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) may progress into developing esophageal strictures, which constitute one of the most severe complications of EoE. As esophageal narrowing is frequently under-detected during endoscopy in patients with EoE compared to barium esophagram, the prevalence of clinically relevant fibrostenosing EoE is underestimated in regular practice.

Patient age and delayed diagnosis are recognized as determining factors for a fibrotic and stricturing EoE phenotype: for every 10-year increase in patients' age, the odds of having a fibrostenotic EoE phenotype at diagnosis doubled. The association between a delay in diagnosis and stricture formation has been independently demonstrated in adult cohorts from Switzerland and the United States: the prevalence of fibrotic features of EoE, based on endoscopy, increased from 46.5% to 87.5% when the diagnostic delay was respectively 0–2 years or more than 20 years from symptom onset. The esophageal diameter (determined as the smallest esophageal dilation bougie with moderate resistance during dilation) was < 10 mm in patients with a 15-year diagnostic delay, but ⩾17 mm when it was only 5 years. Esophageal strictures are less commonly found in pediatric cases of EoE, most likely due to the limited progression of the disease. In addition, esophageal narrowing in children more commonly involves an inflammatory component that responds well to anti-inflammatory medical treatment; therefore, esophageal dilation is usually reserved for selected cases.

### Assessment of real-world disease severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States [^116c4f9u]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Following diagnosis, first-, second-, and third-line treatment options for EoE were independent of EoE disease severity. The treatments used aligned with the AGA/JTF 2020 clinical guidelines for EoE management, which strongly recommended topical corticosteroids over no treatment and conditionally recommended PPIs as primary pharmacologic choices. However, a greater proportion of patients received PPIs than topical corticosteroids first-line, despite this difference in strength of recommendation in the clinical practice guidelines available at the time. This could be related to the ease of administration, access to and/or familiarity with PPIs, or a lack of availability of compounding pharmacies for the preparation of topical corticosteroids.

Furthermore, although not mentioned in the guidelines at the time, histamine-2-receptor blockers were used by approximately 15% of adolescents and adults first-line. However, this result is surprising as there is no evidence to support that this medication class is effective in treating EoE. Systemic corticosteroids were not used first-line but were used in approximately 10%–15% of patients as a second- or third-line treatment option. This may also be considered relatively high when taking into account that topical corticosteroids were recommended over systemic corticosteroids in the clinical practice guidelines. Reasons for this may include patient preference for administration method, concomitant treatment of non-EoE related conditions or, as mentioned, the lack of availability of compounding pharmacies.

### Efficacy of therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis in real-world practice [^113VaNSb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Topical steroids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and dietary interventions are recommended as first- and second-line therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We investigated differences in their effectiveness in a real-world, clinical practice cohort of patients with EoE.

- **Methods**: We collected data on the efficacy of different therapies for EoE, specifically their ability to induce clinical and histologic remission, from the multicenter EoE CONNECT database. This database comprises patients with a confirmed diagnosis of EoE in Europe and began in 2016. We obtained data from 589 patients treated at 11 centers on various parameters, including sex, age, time of diagnosis, starting date of any therapy, response to therapy, treatment end dates, alternative treatments, and findings from endoscopy.

The baseline endoscopy was used for the diagnosis of EoE, while a second endoscopy was performed to evaluate the response to first-line therapies. Following changes in treatment, generally due to a lack of efficacy, a final endoscopy was performed. The time elapsed between endoscopies depended on the criteria of attending physicians. Clinical remission was defined by a decrease of more than 50% in the Dysphagia Symptom Score; improvement in symptoms by less than 50% from baseline was considered a clinical response. Histologic remission was defined as a peak eosinophil count below 5 eosinophils/hpf. A peak eosinophil count between 5 and 14 eosinophils/hpf was considered a histologic response. We identified factors associated with therapy selection and effectiveness using χ2 and multinomial logistic regression analyses.

### Future of therapy and monitoring for eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases [^112vgcew]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis, are chronic TH2-mediated diseases. Establishing a diagnosis and initiating treatment are crucial to limit disease progression, which may lead to tissue remodeling and the development of strictures that significantly affect patients' quality of life. Expert consensus guidelines provide a framework for treating eosinophilic esophagitis with diet elimination, proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical steroids, or dupilumab, and for monitoring with sedated endoscopy for gross and histologic evaluation. Although this provides an established algorithm for treating and monitoring eosinophilic esophagitis, there is less established research for the rarer eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, such as eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, and colitis.

Research advancements continue to emerge rapidly, identifying potential biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and monitoring strategies. In this article, we review the currently accepted methods for treating and monitoring eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, with a focus on eosinophilic esophagitis. We assess methods currently under investigation and provide an aspirational vision for future disease management with a streamlined algorithm of personalized medicine and less invasive monitoring.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116dCqeb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In the absence of secondary causes, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, local, progressive, T-helper type 2 immune-mediated disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. In the last 20 years, the incidence and prevalence of EoE have risen sharply, and the chances of encountering affected patients in clinics and endoscopy rooms have increased. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6 years in both children and adults. Unfortunately, the longer the disease stays unrecognized, the likelier it is for the patient to have persistent or increased esophageal eosinophilic inflammation, complain of non-resolving symptoms, and develop fibrotic complications.

Early detection depends on the recognition of initial clinical manifestations that vary from childhood to adulthood and even among patients of the same age. The disease phenotype also influences therapeutic approaches that include drugs, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. We have herein reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE, focusing on differences and similarities between children and adults that may certainly serve in daily clinical practice.

### Monitoring patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in routine clinical practice - International expert recommendations [^112MaNYW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

The aims of this study originate from the absence of studies or recommendations on optimal monitoring strategies for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Our objective was to develop guidance on how to monitor patients with EoE in routine clinical practice, based on available clinical evidence and expert opinion.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary, international group of EoE experts identified three important questions during several consensus meetings: why, by what means, and when to monitor patients with EoE. A steering committee was established, and three teams were formed to review literature and formulate statements for each topic. In a Delphi survey, a level of agreement of ≥ 75% was defined as the threshold for acceptance. In a final conference, results were presented, critical points and comments on the statements were discussed, and statements were rephrased or rewritten if necessary.

- **Results**: Eighteen EoE experts (14 adult and pediatric gastroenterologists, 2 pathologists, and 2 allergists) with a median of 21.7 years in clinical practice, mostly based in academic or university settings, completed the Delphi survey, which included 11 statements and a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients with EoE. Each statement attained ≥ 75% agreement. Participants mostly debated about the statement concerning surveillance intervals for EoE patients with stable disease.

- **Conclusions**: It was concluded that effective maintenance treatment probably reduces the development of EoE complications, and regular, structured, and, under certain conditions, individualized clinical follow-up is essential.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^114qfKmq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Recommended PPI doses to induce EoE remission in adults are omeprazole 20–40 mg twice daily or equivalent, and in children 1–2 mg/kg of omeprazole daily or equivalent. This medication is recommended to be used for at least 8 weeks, and effectiveness should be assessed with the aid of endoscopy with biopsies. A non-significant trend toward greater efficacy was observed when the daily dose was divided into two intakes. The drug should also be used to maintain disease remission in the long term in EoE patients with an initial response to PPI therapy, as discontinuation leads to symptomatic and/or histological relapse. The long-term strategy is to use the minimal effective dose to maintain remission, usually standard PPI doses. According to surveys carried out in different clinical settings, this has made PPI the most commonly prescribed initial therapy to treat patients with EoE of all ages.

At present, no randomized trial has compared the effectiveness or safety of PPI with other treatment options, and it is not expected that we will have such a study soon. Hence, the most solid demonstration of the effectiveness of PPI in real-world practice has been provided by the EoE CONNECT registry, a European collaborative research project based on data registered by collaborators at 40 study sites. After analyzing data from 630 patients (including 76 children) treated with different PPI drugs at several dosages, it was confirmed that, overall, PPI therapy reduced eosinophil density below the diagnostic threshold of 15 eos/hpf in 48.8% of patients, with 37.9% of patients achieving ≤ ​threshold levels.

### New approaches to diet therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis [^113t3RGS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

An empiric step-up (2–4–6) elimination diet remains the most common dietary approach in clinical practice when treating eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). However, research in this field has fallen behind pharmacological therapy. This review aims to summarize novel approaches to dietary therapy for EoE.

- **Recent findings**: A first prospective multicenter study in 41 pediatric patients (mean age 9 years) has evaluated the efficacy of a cow's milk elimination diet. This dietary approach led to histological remission in 51% of patients, albeit a caveat is that up to 80% of patients were receiving concomitant therapy with proton pump inhibitors. In a series of 18 adult patients with documented milk-induced EoE, ingestion of 400 mL of sterilized milk (boiled for up to 20 minutes) daily for 8 weeks did not induce histologic relapse in two-thirds of patients.

- **Summary**: Milk elimination diet is effective in one-half of pediatric EoE patients and should likely be the first choice in children with EoE (within a step-up dietary approach). Promising data on tolerance of sterilized milk in adults with milk-induced EoE (66%) merit further replication in children, which may radically improve quality of life for patients and their caregivers.

### Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: Diet or medication [^113nPxsz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an antigen-triggered chronic disease with increasing prevalence in both children and adults. If left untreated or resistant to therapy, EoE can lead to complications such as esophageal food impactions and luminal narrowing. In the past decade, numerous clinical trials have explored EoE therapies, including elimination diets, proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and biologics. This review provides commentary on the state of the art in the dietary and pharmacologic management of EoE, while emphasizing the need for future clinical trials to tailor therapies to individual patients with this chronic disease.

### Quality indicators for the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^11183TD3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Despite best practice recommendations for managing eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), variation in care exists.

- **Methods**: We used established methodology for quality indicator development to identify metrics to define quality for the treatment of EoE.

- **Results**: Among 29 proposed quality indicator statements, 9 (31%) were adopted as highly valid across all categories. Two (22%) of these statements were identified as having existing or suspected quality gaps.

- **Discussion**: We identified highly valid EoE quality indicators for adult gastroenterologists, which can be used for quality improvement with resulting benefits for patient outcomes.

### Medical and dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113NJUzE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a disease characterized by chronic, allergen-driven, T-helper 2 (Th2) immune-mediated inflammation that can lead to fibrostenosis of the esophagus if untreated. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for the treatment of EoE. This review focuses on the medical and dietary management of EoE.

- **Data sources**: Manuscripts on EoE treatments were identified through PubMed.
- **Study selections**: Original research, randomized control trials, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and case series were selected and reviewed, as well as relevant case reports.
- **Results**: Treatment strategies for EoE patients involve monotherapy or combination therapy, incorporating dietary modifications to exclude antigenic stimulation and the use of topical corticosteroids to control Th2-mediated tissue inflammation and pathological remodeling. Dilation can serve as a rescue therapy for a narrowed, fibrostenotic, symptomatic esophagus but may be avoided with optimal medical and elimination diet therapies. The molecular mechanisms of EoE pathogenesis are being unraveled, leading to the development of targeted therapies evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. Clinical research efforts focus on optimizing the delivery, dosing, frequency, and duration of topical corticosteroid treatment, either alone or in combination with a tailored elimination diet. Preliminary clinical trials with biologics targeting interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13/IL-4 have been completed.

Topical corticosteroid and elimination diet therapy remain important strategies for managing EoE.

Regarding medical management for eosinophilic esophagitis, particularly concerning swallowed corticosteroids, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend administering swallowed topical corticosteroids after meals or before bedtime, with nothing to eat or drink for 30–60 minutes afterward. This practice helps maximize medication dwell time in the esophagus.

### Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: Overview, current limitations, and future direction [^112qNBHZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an increasingly recognized syndrome presenting with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms in association with hypereosinophilia (> 15 eosinophils/HPF) on esophageal mucosal biopsies. The pathogenesis is unknown, but candidate etiologies include food and aeroallergen hypersensitivity and an unusual presentation of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

This review highlights the treatments of EE in children and adults. Treatments are controversial, few data are available in adults, and long-term studies are almost nonexistent. We outline the limitations in the studies and suggest seven major issues in the study design that must be addressed in future drug trials.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^1167wsiS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of PPI therapy to induce symptomatic and histological remission of EoE has been demonstrated in multiple observational studies, mostly based on case series, with both prospective and retrospective elements, and involving patients of all ages. The 33 studies available up to 2016 were summarized in a systematic review with meta-analysis, which provided evidence that PPIs given at double doses led to histological remission (defined as < 15 eos/hpf) in 50.5% (95% CI = 42.2–58.7%) and symptomatic improvement in 60.8% (95% CI = 48.38–72.2%) of patients, irrespective of patient age, study design, or type of PPI evaluated. In addition, PPI effectiveness to induce remission of EoE was independent of the presence of pathological exposure to acid, demonstrated by esophageal pH-metry. Subsequent data provided evidence on the effectiveness of PPI in maintaining remission.

In children, a prospective series showed that 78% remained in remission after 1 year with half the dose used for induction. In adults, PPIs at half the initial dose maintained clinical and histological remission in at least 75% of patients after at least 1 year of follow-up.

- **Notably**: Dose escalation recovered remission in most relapsing patients, thus demonstrating PPI as a suitable first-line therapy to induce and maintain remission in 50% of patients with EoE. Evidence-based guidelines published in 2017 first recommended PPI as a cheap, accessible, and convenient therapy with moderate effectiveness in treating EoE; an international consensus document supported this recommendation in 2018, and placed PPI.

### The management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1127roQ7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a clinicopathologic, chronic esophageal inflammatory disease resistant to acid suppressive therapy and is associated with variable symptoms indicative of upper gastrointestinal dysfunction. Per guidelines established by the International Group of Eosinophil Researchers (TIGERS), the diagnosis is made in symptomatic patients following a biopsy confirms a peak eosinophil level of ≥ 15 eosinophils/high-powered field (HPF). The esophagus is distinguished by pronounced tissue eosinophilia, in which dietary antigens are key inciting factors for disease pathogenesis; EoE being reversed by elimination of triggering food allergens suggests that the disease is mediated in part by allergic sensitization to foods. Moreover, experimental EoE in mice can be induced not only via food exposure but also via aeroallergen exposure.

Consistent with an allergic etiology rather than an acid-induced esophagitis, swallowed glucocorticoids are effective for the treatment of EoE. Evaluation by an allergist is a recommended part of the diagnostic workup, especially for management of allergic comorbidities. Clinical practice for the evaluation of patients with EoE mainly relies on prick skin tests due to the ease and validation of these tests in the context of immediate hypersensitivity. However, both atopy patch testing and serum IgE testing have been used in EoE. Herein, we reviewed the basic clinical features of EoE with a focus on the approach to diagnosing causative food allergens and to dietary therapy.

An orally disintegrating tablet formulation of fluticasone, given at several doses over 8–12 weeks, has proved superior to placebo in inducing clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission of EoE. An ongoing phase III trial will also evaluate the effectiveness of this compound for an additional 40-week maintenance phase in adults with EoE (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04281108). ~~Dose ranges and specific instructions for administration of topical steroids in EoE are presented in Table 1.~~

STC appears to have a favorable safety profile when used to treat EoE, with no serious side effects in the short term. These are mostly limited to oropharyngeal and esophageal Candida infections. This complication has been described in up to 16% of patients of all ages, irrespective of taking viscous formulas, orodispersible tablets, or aerosol metered doses. Patients were generally asymptomatic, and candidiasis was diagnosed incidentally during post-treatment endoscopies. Candidiasis in EoE responded easily to specific therapy, with no need to withdraw STC. Neither was the rate of candidiasis increased when STCs were used in the long term.

Recent concerns about the potential risk of suppressing systemic cortisol by topical corticosteroids have arisen, especially in children. Observational studies, consisting of short series of patients with EoE, have provided conflicting results due to employing different methods of determining adrenal function, which included measuring basal cortisol levels.

### Italian EoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^116EFYga]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

To highlight the clinical setting of an uncontrolled disease, symptoms must be contextualized to histological and endoscopic assessments, as symptoms do not correlate well with endoscopic findings. As a late indicator of disease progression, even when symptoms appear to be controlled, EoE can hide its progression in the deep layers of the esophagus. Considering this, EoExperts shared the recommendation to adopt the "Symptom Control, Observation, Pathological Evaluation" (S.C.O.P.E.) scheme as a comprehensive tool that can help physicians correctly classify responses to therapy and evaluate the need for a therapeutic switch in uncontrolled disease. The S.C.O.P.E. scheme considers symptoms, adaptive behaviors, and the previous number of treatments, together with endoscopic and histological aspects. Therefore, this system becomes a recommended tool for the multidimensional evaluation of EoE control.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: A review [^115DFugd]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus that affects an estimated 34.4 per 100,000 people in Europe and North America. EoE impacts both children and adults, causing dysphagia, food impaction, and esophageal strictures.

EoE is characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, such as vomiting, dysphagia, or feeding difficulties, in a patient with an esophageal biopsy showing at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field. This diagnosis occurs in the absence of other conditions associated with esophageal eosinophilia, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or achalasia. Both genetic and environmental factors, like early life exposure to antibiotics, are associated with EoE.

- **Therapies include**:
	- Proton pump inhibitors
	- Topical steroid preparations, such as fluticasone and budesonide
	- Dietary therapy with amino acid formula or empirical food elimination
	- Endoscopic dilation

In a systematic review of observational studies including 1,051 patients with EoE, proton pump inhibitor therapy was associated with a histologic response (defined as less than 15 eosinophils per high-power field on endoscopic biopsy) in 41.7% of patients, while placebo showed a 13.3% response rate. Another systematic review of eight randomized trials involving 437 patients with EoE found topical corticosteroid treatment was linked to histologic remission in 64.9% of patients, compared to 13.3% with placebo. Patients with esophageal narrowing may require dilation.

Objective assessment of therapeutic response is crucial for managing EoE effectively.

Of note, in the context of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the terms 'inadequately controlled', 'intolerant to', and 'not candidates for' conventional therapy require clear operational definitions to guide clinical decision-making.

- **Inadequately controlled**: Refers to patients whose symptoms and disease activity persist or worsen despite an appropriate course of conventional therapy (i.e. proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], topical corticosteroids [TCS], and dietary interventions). It implies that the chosen treatment regimen, pharmacological or dietary, has not effectively managed or alleviated EoE symptoms and eosinophilic inflammation.

- **Intolerant to**: Describes patients who experience adverse reactions or side effects significantly impacting their quality of life (QoL) or hindering adherence to prescribed treatment. These reactions might manifest as allergic responses, gastrointestinal discomfort, or other adverse effects compromising continued adherence to the recommended therapy.

- **Not candidates for**: This category includes individuals for whom standard treatment options are deemed unsuitable or present unacceptable risks. It may encompass patients with contraindications to specific medications or those for whom dietary restrictions are impractical or unsustainable.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1163yZYc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

There is no universally accepted treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis. Topical corticosteroids, hypoallergenic diets, proton pump inhibitors, biologics, and dilation have all been used to treat eosinophilic esophagitis. In 2010, a previous version of this review was published that included only three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The number of published RCTs in pediatric and adult eosinophilic esophagitis that meet our inclusion criteria has grown substantially, with a rapid pace of clinical trial publications and changing outcome metrics. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence from RCTs assessing non‐surgical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis.

### Italian EoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^1145ZZgM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

To accurately assess the landscape of EoE management, an in-depth literature review was first conducted to gather insights on disease management and identify existing knowledge gaps. This web-based study was conducted over a period of 6 months and spanned various Italian regions and healthcare professional specialties. It began with a non-systematic literature review and progressed through survey administration, expert panel discussions, and culminated in the final output. The literature review focused on hot topics identified by the EoExpert Panel, and all results were then critically examined and validated. Based on these results, a 21-question survey was developed and administered to EoExperts with the aim of gathering insights regarding the management of EoE, benefits/risks of continuous versus intermittent therapy, definition of complete disease control, and the best approach to follow up the patient.

The literature selection of our expert opinion panel article is based on expert judgment rather than a systematic process, and the literature review was performed in April 2024 covering articles published between January 1, 2017, and March 31, 2024. The databases that were used were PubMed, OVID, and EMBASE with the key search terms as "eosinophilic esophagitis" AND "disease progression" OR "impact" OR "guidelines" OR "control" OR "remission", "follow-up", OR "quality of life" OR "adaptive behaviors".

All project phases are illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed as follows.

### What's new in the diagnosis and therapy of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113ZvxKs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a relatively new chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. Novel aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of EoE are discussed in this review.

- **Recent findings**: The development of diagnostic guidelines, which consist of symptoms as well as endoscopic and histopathologic criteria, has improved the awareness of clinicians and the diagnosing of EoE. The clinically challenging discrimination of EoE from gastroesophageal reflux disease has become more apparent and has evoked the need for more individualized therapy options. Today, most patients with EoE can be treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. However, no convincing alternative treatment strategies exist for corticosteroid-refractory or corticosteroid-dependent patients. Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the eotaxin-3 gene has been linked to increased disease susceptibility for EoE.

- **Summary**: EoE is an emerging esophageal disease. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder would improve clinical recognition and diagnostic ability, ultimately providing patients with more optimal treatment options.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: Insights for the clinician [^113txqnx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has been one of the biggest advances in the short life of EoE. Over the course of just one decade, these drugs, initially developed to inhibit gastric acid secretion, have evolved. They have progressed from being used as an instrument to rule out gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as a cause of esophageal eosinophilia, to defining PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (a provisional condition now recognized as true EoE), and finally, to constituting an anti-inflammatory treatment for EoE.

Beyond its antisecretive properties, PPIs have shown an effect in downregulating esophageal gene expression of eotaxin-3/CCL26 and Th2 cytokines, specifically interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13, in biopsies from patients with EoE. This effect is similar to that of patients treated with topical corticosteroids. PPIs also restore the integrity of the damaged esophageal mucosa among patients who respond to treatment and reverse the inflammatory transcriptome. They help reverse fibrous remodeling in patients with EoE, restoring fibrotic features in endoscopy and improving esophageal distensibility.

All these effects of PPIs in EoE are independent of their inhibition of gastric acid secretion, which adds to the antioxidant properties previously described for PPIs. Their direct effects on inflammatory and epithelial cells could prevent inflammation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^11583f5n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

When treating patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), it is desirable to:

- **Induce and maintain remission**: Achieve eosinophilic inflammation below 15 eosinophils per high-power field.
- **Control symptoms**: Improve the quality of life by managing symptoms effectively.
- **Prevent and treat complications**

- **Therapeutic options**: These include drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and topical corticosteroids, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. Any treatment may be offered as first-line and later interchanged; however, the choice should consider the EoE phenotype (i.e. inflammatory versus fibrostenotic), the patient's clinical characteristics, preference, tolerance to treatment, as well as costs and available expertise.

### Management of refractory eosinophilic oesophagitis [^116SFj6e]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

The goal of this review is to discuss the clinical approach to patients who do not respond to treatment for eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE). Refractory EoE is challenging to manage as there are limited data to guide decision-making. In this review, refractory EoE is defined as persistent eosinophilia in the setting of incomplete resolution of the primary presenting symptoms and incomplete resolution of endoscopic findings following a PPI trial, and after treatment with either topical steroids or dietary elimination. However, this definition is controversial.

This review will examine these controversies, explore how frequently non-response is observed, and highlight potential explanations and predictors of non-response. Non-response is common and affects a large proportion of patients with EoE. It is important to systematically assess multiple possible causes of non-response, as well as consider treatment complications and an incorrect diagnosis of EoE. If non-response is confirmed, second-line treatments are required. Although the overall response rate for second-line therapy is disappointing, with only half of patients eventually responding, there are several promising agents that are currently under investigation, and the future is bright for new treatment modalities for refractory EoE.
