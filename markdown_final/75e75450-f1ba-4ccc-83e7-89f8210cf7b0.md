## Question

Is high-dose vitamin D an appropriate treatment for myasthenia gravis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-dose vitamin D is an appropriate treatment for myasthenia gravis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "high-dose vitamin D" should be defined versus standard deficiency replacement. Then, I should verify what current MG guidelines list as evidence-based treatments and whether vitamin D appears there. Next, I will check for direct clinical evidence in MG, followed by mechanistic plausibility and safety signals. Finally, I need to synthesize a practical recommendation, including when and how to replace vitamin D safely if deficiency is present [^115tWNob].

> Let me first confirm definitions because I don't want to conflate "replacement" with "therapeutic high-dose". High-dose in this context generally refers to amounts exceeding the tolerable upper intake level, such as chronic intakes above 4,000–10,000 IU/day or large loading regimens intended for immunomodulation rather than deficiency correction, whereas replacement dosing typically uses 800–2,000 IU/day, or short courses of 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks when deficiency is documented [^111TsKkR] [^114GRJMf] [^113zRN7e]. Wait, I should double-check special situations like obesity or malabsorption where higher doses are recommended for deficiency; indeed, the Endocrine Society allows 6,000–10,000 IU/day for a limited period to achieve 25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL, but that is still deficiency correction rather than disease-modifying therapy in MG [^115rP1Fz].

> Next, I should review the evidence-based standard of care in MG to see if vitamin D is endorsed as a treatment. International guidance emphasizes symptomatic acetylcholinesterase inhibition with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids for patients not meeting goals on symptomatic therapy, nonsteroidal immunosuppressants as steroid-sparing agents, rapid-acting therapies like IVIG or plasma exchange for exacerbations, thymectomy in selected cases, and targeted biologics in refractory disease; notably, vitamin D at any dose is not listed as a disease-modifying therapy in these consensus statements [^115tWNob] [^111ShcUj] [^114GeJBr] [^112Fht4Q] [^111VQsnT] [^111nDSvb] [^111u5TPs].

> Now, I will examine direct clinical evidence in MG for vitamin D as a treatment. A small pilot study in MG found lower 25(OH)D levels in patients versus controls and suggested improvement in fatigue scores after low-dose cholecalciferol at 800 IU/day, but this was replacement dosing, not high-dose therapy, and the design was limited by small size, lack of a control group, and absence of disease-modifying endpoints such as remission or steroid-sparing effects [^115MJgFV]. Hold on, I should verify whether any randomized or prospective studies of high-dose vitamin D exist in MG; I do not find MG-specific randomized trials or cohort studies of high-dose vitamin D as a disease-modifying intervention in the provided sources [^115MJgFV].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility while not over-interpreting it. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects in preclinical systems, including suppression of T cell proliferation, promotion of regulatory T cells, and tolerogenic effects on dendritic cells, which makes an immunologic rationale plausible, but translation to clinical benefit in MG has not been demonstrated to date in high-quality trials, and mechanistic plausibility alone cannot substitute for clinical outcome data [^116MtQJ2] [^113257FP] [^113Go8Pg]. Wait, I should verify whether broader interventional data in autoimmunity support high-dose vitamin D as a disease-modifying strategy; even where signals exist for prevention in aggregate autoimmune outcomes, these do not establish efficacy or safety for high-dose therapeutic use in established MG [^113Go8Pg].

> Safety is the next critical layer, and I need to ensure we do not overlook risk signals. High-dose vitamin D or active analogs can precipitate hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and related complications, with labeling for calcitriol specifically warning about overdose risks and the need for frequent calcium and phosphorus monitoring; caution is particularly important in patients on digitalis due to arrhythmia risk during hypercalcemia [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf] [^117VAWkx] [^112rZ77J]. But wait, what about signals from non-MG populations? A large randomized trial of a single 540,000 IU dose in critically ill, vitamin D–deficient adults showed no mortality benefit, underscoring that very high loading may not deliver the expected clinical gains and may expose patients to risk without benefit in stress states, though it was not an MG study [^113Raj3k]. Moreover, in a murine model of CNS autoimmunity, sustained high 25(OH)D levels above 200 nmol/L precipitated fulminant disease via calcium-mediated T-cell excitability, which raises a theoretical concern that disproportionate supplementation could be counterproductive in autoimmune settings, particularly if hypercalcemia occurs, although extrapolation to MG requires caution [^114npqfW].

> I should now integrate deficiency management because many MG patients are on corticosteroids, which increase the risk of low bone mineral density and vitamin D deficiency. The appropriate, evidence-based approach is to screen and treat bona fide vitamin D deficiency using standard replacement regimens, typically vitamin D3 or D2 as per Endocrine Society guidance, with adjustments for obesity or malabsorption and laboratory monitoring to reach and maintain 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, rather than employing disease-modifying "high-dose" strategies in MG [^114GRJMf] [^111TsKkR] [^115rP1Fz] [^113zRN7e]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring needs; serum calcium should be assessed, particularly with loading regimens or when hypercalcemia risk factors are present, to ensure safety during repletion [^113zRN7e].

> Let me ensure that the recommendation does not inadvertently delay established MG care. If the clinical goal is improving myasthenic weakness, evidence-based MG therapies should be used and optimized, including pyridostigmine for symptomatic relief, corticosteroids and steroid-sparing immunosuppressants for disease control, IVIG or plasma exchange for rapid worsening, thymectomy where indicated, and targeted agents such as complement inhibitors in refractory AChR-positive disease; substituting high-dose vitamin D for these proven therapies would be inappropriate [^115tWNob] [^111ShcUj] [^111VQsnT] [^111nDSvb] [^111u5TPs] [^111WPcn9].

> Bottom line, I should be precise. High-dose vitamin D is not an appropriate treatment for myasthenia gravis as a disease-modifying therapy given the absence of supportive MG clinical trial data, its omission from authoritative MG guidelines, and credible safety concerns with disproportionate dosing; however, documented vitamin D deficiency should be corrected using standard, guideline-based replacement with appropriate monitoring, especially in patients on long-term corticosteroids or with bone health risk, rather than employing high-dose regimens for immunomodulation in MG outside of a clinical trial [^115tWNob] [^111TsKkR] [^115rP1Fz] [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf] [^113Raj3k] [^114npqfW].

---

High-dose vitamin D is not recommended for myasthenia gravis because there is **no clinical evidence** of benefit and **significant risks** of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment [^112Nbuvs]. MG guidelines do not include **vitamin D as therapy** [^115tWNob]; standard care remains pyridostigmine [^111WPcn9], corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants [^112Fht4Q]. Vitamin D should be used only to **correct deficiency** [^114GRJMf], with monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels to avoid toxicity [^113zRN7e].

## Evidence for high-dose vitamin D supplementation in MG

Clinical evidence does not support high-dose vitamin D for MG, and current **guidelines** do not recommend it as therapy.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation

High-dose vitamin D supplementation carries **significant risks**, particularly in patients with autoimmune disorders such as MG:

- **Hypercalcemia**: Excessive vitamin D intake can cause hypercalcemia, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and confusion [^112Fktmf].

- **Hypercalciuria**: Elevated calcium levels can result in hypercalciuria, increasing the risk of kidney stones and renal impairment [^112Nbuvs].

- **Renal impairment**: High-dose vitamin D supplementation can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions.

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D supplementation can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients on digitalis therapy [^112Fktmf].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines for MG management **do not include vitamin D supplementation** as a standard treatment:

- **Pyridostigmine**: Recommended as initial symptomatic therapy for MG [^111WPcn9].

- **Corticosteroids**: Recommended for patients who do not achieve treatment goals with pyridostigmine alone [^112Fht4Q] [^1123ddQ1].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and other immunosuppressants are recommended for long-term management of MG [^112Fht4Q] [^112MgmuD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

High-dose vitamin D supplementation is **not recommended** for patients with MG because efficacy is unproven and there are significant risks of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria [^112Nbuvs], and renal impairment. Current clinical guidelines do not include vitamin D supplementation as standard treatment for MG. Therefore, vitamin D should be used only to correct deficiency, with careful monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels to avoid toxicity.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^113ssjRj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic and IS treatment of MG:

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. The pyridostigmine dose should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can indicate that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.

2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. Additionally, a nonsteroidal IS agent should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when:
	- **Steroid side effects**: Deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop.
	- **Inadequate response**: Response to an adequate trial of corticosteroids is inadequate.
	- **Corticosteroid dose management**: The corticosteroid dose cannot be reduced due to symptom relapse.

3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered when selecting among these agents:
	- **Variation in practice**: There is widespread variation in practice with respect to the choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them.
	- **First-line use**: Expert consensus and some RCT evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG.
	- **RCT evidence**: Evidence from RCTs supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects should be considered.

### Calcitriol [^112Nbuvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are the same as for an overdose of vitamin D (see adverse reactions). High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with calcitriol may lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca × P) product should not exceed 70 mg²/dL². High levels of calcium in the dialysate bath may contribute to hypercalcemia (see warnings).

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**: General treatment of hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range) consists of immediate discontinuation of calcitriol therapy, institution of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia ensues. Hypercalcemia frequently resolves in 2 to 7 days. When serum calcium levels have returned to normal limits, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose of 0.25 mcg/day less than prior therapy. Serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly after all dosage changes and subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate.

### Calcitriol [^112Fktmf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Excessive dosage of calcitriol injection induces hypercalcemia and, in some instances, hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined at least twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Calcitriol injection should be given cautiously to patients on digitalis, because hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

- **Information for the patient**: The patient and their guardians should be informed about adherence to instructions regarding diet and calcium supplementation, and the avoidance of unapproved non-prescription drugs, including magnesium-containing antacids. Patients should also be carefully informed about the symptoms of hypercalcemia [see adverse reactions].

- **Essential laboratory tests**: Serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and 24-hour urinary calcium and phosphorus should be determined periodically. During the initial phase of the medication, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined more frequently (twice weekly). Adynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormal levels. If biopsy is not being done for other diagnostic reasons, PTH levels may be used to indicate the rate of bone turnover. If PTH levels fall below the recommended target range (1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) in patients treated with calcitriol injection, the calcitriol injection dose should be reduced or therapy discontinued.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^112CBsun]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB patients who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables including the presence of thymoma and the operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001).

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^115JrqXQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

- **Maximum severity, achievement of status, and other treatment in three groups classified by oral PSL dosing regimen**: Pearson's Χ² test showed a significantly higher percentage of patients with maximum severity in the high-dose group compared with the other two groups (P < 0.0001). ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer test also indicated that the worst QMG score for the entire disease period was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the high-dose group (18.6 ± 7.9) than in the intermediate-dose group (14.4 ± 6.4) or the low-dose group (13.9 ± 6.3).

	- The proportion of patients who maintained MM-or-better-5mg for ≥ 6 months was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the low-dose group than in the intermediate-dose or high-dose group during 3 years after treatment was started. Specifically, the low-dose group reported:
	- 52.1% vs 11.4% or 9.6% after 1 year of treatment,
	- 61.2% vs 30.8% or 29.9% after 2 years,
	- 64.1% vs 36.4% or 44.1% after 3 years.

	- Patients in the high-dose group received a smaller cumulative HMP dose compared with patients in the low-dose group (12.9 ± 25.8 vs 23.1 ± 37.8 g, P = 0.01). Treatment with PE/PP was significantly less frequent (P = 0.02) in the intermediate-dose group (30.3%) than in the high-dose group (43.7%) or the low-dose group (40.7%).

	- The rates of combined EFT and early combined use of CNIs starting within 6 months of treatment were significantly different:
	- **Combined EFT**: 31.4% in the high-dose group, 39.8% in the intermediate-dose group, 53.6% in the low-dose group.
	- **Early combined use of CNIs**: 12.2% in the high-dose group, 29.8% in the intermediate-dose group, 47.1% in the low-dose group.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^116MtQJ2]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has significant roles in adaptive immunity and autoimmunity. Preclinical data from the 1980s have established that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in T lymphocytes, and that 1,25(OH)₂D acts as an inhibitor of T cell proliferation and activation. T lymphocytes include various subsets such as CD4⁺ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer cells, γδ T cells, and memory cells. The effects of vitamin D on these T cell subtypes have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. Generally, vitamin D suppresses T cell-driven inflammation and enhances the suppressive function of Treg cells.

The interaction between antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells is particularly important. The intracrine production of 1,25(OH)₂D in DCs induces a more tolerogenic phenotype, marked by the production of IL-10, which, in turn, stimulates the generation of Treg cells. Recent studies suggest that 1,25(OH)₂D modulates DCs' phenotype by altering their metabolic profile. These anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D on DCs and T cells have generated considerable interest in the relationship between vitamin D status, inflammation, and autoimmunity.

In diabetes-prone NOD mice, vitamin D deficiency early in life, even with normal intake later, significantly increased the risk of disease in two independent studies. Additionally, dietary 1,25(OH)₂D has been shown to reduce arthritic lesions in two mouse models of autoimmune arthritis: murine Lyme arthritis and collagen-induced arthritis.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^11313Uxi]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates several key components related to the early fast-acting treatment (EFT) strategy.

- **Kaplan–Meier curves**: Figure 3A presents the Kaplan–Meier curves for the first achievement of the treatment target, defined as minimal manifestations (MM) or better with a prednisolone (PSL) dosage of 5 mg for six months or more. The results are compared across both groups subjected to the low-dose and high-dose PSL regimens.

- **Baseline cumulative hazard curves**: Figure 3B details the time courses of the baseline cumulative hazard curves for both the low-dose and high-dose PSL groups as a function of time. The effects of covariables are excluded from these curves. The baseline cumulative hazard levels in the high-dose PSL group seemed to eventually align with those in the low-dose PSL group, reaching similar levels at around 60 months after the initiation of immune therapy. However, this alignment did not signify a statistically significant difference.

### Vitamin D: An evidence-based review [^111PrJBB]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in bone metabolism and seems to have some anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. In addition, recent epidemiologic studies have observed relationships between low vitamin D levels and multiple disease states. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Although it is well known that the combination of vitamin D and calcium is necessary to maintain bone density as people age, vitamin D may also be an independent risk factor for falls among the elderly. New recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics address the need for supplementation in breastfed newborns, and many questions are raised regarding the role of maternal supplementation during lactation. Unfortunately, little evidence guides clinicians on when to screen for vitamin D deficiency or effective treatment options.

### Treatment of autoimmune myasthenia gravis [^116sqtZY]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) is associated with antibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in 85% of patients. Other postsynaptic neuromuscular junction antigens are implicated, such as muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), in a number of the remaining 15% of patients, referred to as seronegative MG. The autoimmune attack generally leads to decreased concentrations of the AChR and damage to the structure of the endplate itself. This information has guided the empirical treatment of patients with MG and has suggested new treatment strategies.

Whereas the outcome of patients with MG has improved because of more effective symptomatic treatment, including advances in critical care medicine and the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, the greatest advances have come from therapies that directly reduce the autoimmune attack or modify its effects on the AChR and the surrounding endplate. Immune-directed treatment of patients with MG, which is guided by this information and by data from the management of other autoimmune diseases, is aimed at inducing an immunologic remission and then maintaining that remission.

Remission induction is usually accomplished through the use of high-dose corticosteroids, frequently in conjunction with IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Maintenance of the remission is usually accomplished by slowly tapering the corticosteroids along with the use of "steroid-sparing" agents, which include azathioprine, thymectomy, and possibly mycophenolate. Therapy usually begins with cholinesterase inhibitors.

### Early high-dose vitamin D for critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^113Raj3k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, published by the National Heart and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med, focuses on critical illness and vitamin D deficiency. The trial investigated the effect of early high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a population of 1078 patients, comprising 467 females and 611 males. Inclusion criteria included critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients at high risk for death. Key exclusion criteria were an inability to take an enteral drug, a history of kidney stones, the presence of hypercalcemia at baseline, and inability to obtain informed consent in a timely manner.

The interventions were as follows:

- **Vitamin D group**: 538 patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization.
- **Placebo group**: 540 patients received a matched placebo in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization.

The primary outcome revealed no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days (23.5% vs. 20.6%; AD 2.9%, 95% CI -2.1 to 7.9). Secondary outcomes showed no significant difference in in-hospital mortality at 90 days (17.1% vs. 13.4%; AD 3.7%, 95% CI -0.5 to 8) and a borderline significant decrease in hospital l

### High dose vitamin D exacerbates central nervous system autoimmunity by raising T-cell excitatory calcium [^114npqfW]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Poor vitamin D status is associated with a higher relapse rate and earlier disability in multiple sclerosis. Based on these associations, patients with multiple sclerosis are frequently supplemented with the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol, although it is unclear whether this regimen is of therapeutic benefit. To model the consequences of this common practice, mice were fed for more than 3 months with a low, medium, or high dose of cholecalciferol, representative of vitamin D deficiency, modest, and disproportionately high supplementation, respectively, in patients with multiple sclerosis. Compared to vitamin D-deprived mice, moderate supplementation reduced the severity of subsequent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with an expansion of regulatory T cells. Direct exposure of murine or human T cells to vitamin D metabolites inhibited their activation.

In contrast, mice with 25-(OH) vitamin D levels above 200 nmol/l developed fulminant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with massive CNS infiltration of activated myeloid cells, Th1 and Th17 cells. When dissecting this unexpected outcome, we observed that high, but not medium, dose vitamin D had caused mild hypercalcemia, which rendered T cells more prone to pro-inflammatory activation. Exposing murine or human T cells to equivalent calcium concentrations in vitro enhanced its influx, triggering activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene products, and enhanced transmigration across a blood-brain barrier model. These findings suggest that vitamin D, at moderate levels, may exert a direct influence on such processes.

### An update on treatments in myasthenia gravis [^112gPbss]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

This month, we discuss three papers that publish the results of trials into potential treatment approaches to myasthenia gravis (MG). When treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors alone fails to control symptoms, treatment with steroids may be required. Often, these are at high doses, which are associated with adverse side effects both in the short and long term. All the studies explore treatments that may replace or reduce the need for steroids in MG, using the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and prednisone dose requirement as primary or secondary outcomes.

The first paper reports the results of a randomized trial of routine thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG patients. The results may lead to this procedure being incorporated into the routine management of non-thymomatous MG.

- **Alternative treatments**: The second and third papers explore alternative steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. Currently, the only medications shown to be effective in randomized placebo-controlled studies are azathioprine and cyclosporine. However, both carry the risk of adverse reactions and require close monitoring. The second study compares methotrexate and prednisone treatment to prednisone alone, while the final study assesses the effectiveness of leflunomide.

All three studies represent a valuable addition to the literature on treating a condition that currently has limited alternatives to long-term immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from the binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

- **Planning for pregnancy**: This should be instituted well in advance to allow time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and to minimize risks to the fetus.

- **Multidisciplinary communication**: Relevant specialists should communicate throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period.

- **Pregnancy stability**: Provided that myasthenia is under control before pregnancy, most women can be reassured of stability. However, worsening is more likely during the first few months after delivery.

- **Treatment options**: Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. Intravenous ChEIs may induce uterine contractions and should be avoided.

- **Thymectomy considerations**: This procedure should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefits are unlikely during gestation.

- **Diagnostic recommendations**: Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely, but the risks of fetal radiation need careful consideration. Diagnostic CT should preferably be postponed until after delivery unless there is a compelling indication.

- **Recommended medications**: Prednisone is the immunosuppressive agent of choice. Azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe for expectant mothers not satisfactorily controlled with, or unable to tolerate, corticosteroids. Mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase teratogenic risk and are contraindicated during pregnancy.

### Methylprednisolone sodium succinate [^111gAXMi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g. myasthenia gravis) or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g. pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevations of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Additionally, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

- **Ophthalmic**: Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: In post-marketing experience, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients with malignancies, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors, following the use of systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Patients at high risk of TLS, such as those with tumors that have a high proliferative rate, high tumor burden, and high sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions should be taken.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly.

### Safety and efficacy of zilucoplan in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (RAISE): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [^111u5TPs]. The Lancet. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Generalised myasthenia gravis is a chronic, unpredictable, and debilitating rare disease, often accompanied by a high treatment burden and with an unmet need for more efficacious and well-tolerated treatments. Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. We enrolled patients (aged 18–74 years) with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of at least 6, and a quantitative myasthenia gravis score of at least 12. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg once daily by self-injection, or matched placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in the MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was mainly assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04115293. An open-label extension study is ongoing (NCT04225871).

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with myasthenia gravis and improvement of fatigue after supplementation of vitamin D3: a pilot study [^115MJgFV]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. Vitamin D plays an important role in both the autoimmune response and in skeletal muscles. This study determined the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] in patients with MG and in healthy subjects to assess whether vitamin D deficiency is present in MG and whether vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects on fatigue.

- **Methods**: Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were analyzed in 33 patients with MG (22 males; mean age, 58 years) and in 50 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors without vitamin D3 medication. MG composite (MGC) score assessed fatigue. Thirteen patients with MG without previous vitamin D3 supplementation were started on vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol) 800 IU/day, with a follow-up examination after 2.5–10 months (mean, 6 months).

- **Results**: Patients with MG without pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation (N = 16) had a mean MGC of 4.5 and lower plasma 25(OH)D levels (mean, 51 ± 19 nM) than healthy controls (69 ± 21 nM) (P = 0.017). Seventeen patients had pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation due to corticosteroid treatment, with a mean 25(OH)D level of 79 ± 22 nM and a mean MGC of 5.5. In the 13 patients who received cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D levels overall increased at follow-up by 22% (P = 0.033), and the MGC score improved by 38% (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Plasma 25(OH)D levels are significantly lower in patients with MG compared with healthy controls. As vitamin D has beneficial effects on the autoimmune response and on fatigue score in patients with MG, we suggest monitoring and managing vitamin D levels in these patients.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and cholinergic modulation in myasthenia gravis and neuroinflammation [^112cBSPL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2008). Low credibility.

The cholinergic network affects various cellular functions, including neurotransmission and immune reactions. In Myasthenia Gravis (MG), diagnosis and symptomatic therapy rely on cholinergic modulation by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inflammatory pathology, cholinergic system cell loss occurs early. Treatments with specific AChEI enhance cholinergic transmission and may act as anti-inflammatory agents via immunocompetent cells expressing the alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory T-cell-mediated disease, demyelination and neurodegeneration follow neuroinflammation. MS treatment includes anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs. AChEI can induce cholinergic up-regulation, subsequently affecting neuroinflammation via alpha-7-AChR expressing cells. These effects are in addition to the cognitive benefits induced by AChEI.

### A phase 3 trial of inebilizumab in generalized myasthenia gravis [^1149FaBo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study MINT was published in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to myasthenia gravis.

- **Trial question**: What is the role of inebilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD19-positive B cells, in patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 236 patients (144 female, 92 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Receipt of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methotrexate in the past 4 weeks; use of corticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Inebilizumab group (n = 119)**: Intravenous dose of 300 mg administered on days 1 and 15 for all, and additionally on day 183 for patients who were AChR antibody-positive for 52 weeks or 26 weeks for those who were MuSK antibody-positive.
	- **Placebo group (n = 117)**: Matching placebo for 52 weeks for participants who were AChR antibody-positive or 26 weeks for those who were MuSK antibody-positive.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living scale score at week 26 for the overall population (4.2 points vs. 2.2 points; MD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.9).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant improvements in other clinical measures and patient-reported outcomes.

### New and emerging treatments for myasthenia gravis [^111nDSvb]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The role of eculizumab in AChR+ gMG is still being determined, and currently, this treatment tends to be reserved for those with refractory symptoms. Because patients receiving eculizumab have shown benefit as early as one week after the start of treatment, it might eventually have a role in treating myasthenia gravis crisis.

An unwanted complication of complement inhibition is a greatly increased risk of infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Patients receiving complement inhibitors should receive double meningococcal vaccination with ACYW conjugate and serogroup B vaccine at least two weeks before the first drug infusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory if the drug is started within two weeks of vaccination.

Ravulizumab is a long-acting C5 complement inhibitor engineered over the backbone of eculizumab. The phase 3 CHAMPION (Safety and Efficacy Study of Ravulizumab in Adults with Generalised Myasthenia Gravis) study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in patients with AChR+ gMG showed significant improvement in the total score on the MG-ADL scale (P < 0.001) and in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score from baseline to week 26 (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. The benefits were seen within one week after the start of treatment and were sustained up to week 26. Ravulizumab is well tolerated and has the benefit of dosing every eight weeks, compared with every two weeks for eculizumab. The FDA approved its use for the treatment of AChR+ gMG in April 2022.

Zilucoplan is a small 15 amino acid macrocyclic peptide.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^11756drW]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, specifically concerning immunosuppressants, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend the following for the selection of immunosuppressive agent dosage and duration of treatment:

- **Tapering corticosteroids**: Gradually reduce the corticosteroid dose once patients achieve treatment goals. Continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help maintain treatment goals in many patients.

- **Tapering nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents**: Slowly reduce the dose to the minimal effective amount once treatment goals have been sustained for 6 months to 2 years. Dosage adjustments should not occur more frequently than every 3–6 months.

- **Risk of relapse**: Be aware that tapering immunosuppressive drugs carries a risk of relapse. This may necessitate an increase in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in symptomatic patients and after rapid tapering.

- **Long-term immunosuppression**: Acknowledge that maintaining some level of immunosuppression is often necessary for many years, if not for the lifetime of the patient.

### Delving into immune modulation: Thymectomy in myasthenia gravis [^115hdE8N]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study still has several limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results. The follow-up period was 12 months, and longer-term studies are required to fully understand the lasting effects of thymectomy on immune function. Additionally, we did not measure regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in immune tolerance and could provide further insights into the immune modulation effects of thymectomy.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^114qDxns]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Among patients treated with early fast-acting treatment (EFT), there were at least two distinct types of oral steroid dosing regimens used for the combined oral prednisone (PSL).

- **Low-dose regimen**: In the group treated with EFT and a low-dose PSL regimen, improvements in myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms associated with living difficulties were mainly due to the early use of fast-acting therapy sets and low-dose (≤ 10 mg/day) oral PSL as maintenance therapy. If symptoms worsened during follow-up, patients were readmitted for a shorter treatment period of 2–7 days for additional fast-acting therapy sets (1 or 2 times). It was generally unnecessary to increase the dose of oral PSL. Patients treated with oral PSL ≥ 20 mg/day for over 3 months were excluded from this category.

- **High-dose regimen**: In the group treated with EFT and a high-dose PSL regimen, MG symptoms were improved by both fast-acting therapy sets and high-dose oral PSL. The treatment involved a dose-escalation schedule until symptoms improved sufficiently or until a maximum dose of 50–60 mg/day was reached. The highest required dose was maintained before tapering.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^1135Ewja]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, particularly concerning immunosuppressants, the EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of immunosuppressive agents in all patients with progressive MG symptoms. It is important to recognize that patients with a thymoma, as well as those with anti-titin and anti-RyR antibodies, usually have severe disease requiring more aggressive treatment strategies.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^115KQZdd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables including the presence of thymoma, and operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001).

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomised clinical trial [^115gWvNw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, with known environmental and genetic risk factors. Vitamin D is a known immunomodulator, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with a higher risk of developing MS and with increased clinical and radiological activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). However, most evidence suggesting a role for vitamin D in MS activity arises from observational studies with inherent possible limitations, including confounding and reverse causality.

Two early pilot trials demonstrated potential promise but had limitations and were not designed as definitive trials, so it remained unclear after their completion if vitamin D supplementation impacts the course of established RRMS. Three randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation did not demonstrate an apparent benefit with respect to the primary outcome but were also limited in duration or size and had some other limitations that reduce confidence in the results. These trials also tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to interferon beta as the MS disease-modifying therapy, where there is a possible interaction between vitamin D and interferon beta, underscoring the importance of evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the context of other MS therapies.

We sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to a first-line disease-modifying therapy (DMT) reduces disease activity among people with active MS.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^111n74fG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term full remission without treatment is uncommon in myasthenia gravis (MG). Only less than 10% of patients with MG achieve the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) post-intervention status of complete stable remission (CSR). Therefore, treatment strategies should consider the probability of prolonged treatment and aim for maintaining health-related quality of life (QOL) and mental health. The recent international consensus guidance for the management of MG proposes a minimal manifestation (MM) status or better as a goal for the treatment of MG. Our research group has also proposed that an MM status or better with prednisolone (PSL) 5 mg/day or lower (MM-or-better-5mg) may be a more practical treatment goal than CSR and achievable by more patients. This goal yields patient satisfaction essentially equivalent to CSR based on patients' QOL.

Among the various immunosuppressive therapies, oral corticosteroids remain the most common agent used for long-term immunosuppression in the management of MG. In traditional therapy, oral corticosteroids have been used at high doses in an escalation and de-escalation fashion. However, there are no reported data supporting the claim that treatment with high-dose oral steroids increases the rate of complete remission in MG, and epidemiological research shows no change in the complete remission rate before and after the use of oral steroids became widespread. Many patients continue to have impaired QOL because of insufficient improvement and long-term steroid-related adverse effects. Furthermore, our previous survey showed that higher PSL doses…

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^112kqWTB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Differences in characteristics of patients classified by oral PSL dosing regimen were observed in the study. Of the 590 patients, 237 were classified into the high-dose group, 187 into the intermediate-dose group, and 166 into the low-dose group. The age of onset differed significantly among the groups, with the high-dose group at 42.3 ± 16.8 years, the intermediate-dose group at 46.4 ± 16.9 years, and the low-dose group at 51.1 ± 19.4 years (P < 0.0001).

- **Thymectomy and thymoma characteristics**: The rates of thymectomy were significantly different at 83.1% for the high-dose group, 65.8% for the intermediate-dose group, and 36.1% for the low-dose group. The prevalence of thymoma was 29.1%, 38.5%, and 22.9% respectively (P = 0.006).

- **Disease duration**: The disease duration was significantly longer in the high-dose group, averaging 15.0 ± 10.0 years (P < 0.0001).

- **AChRAb positivity**: The prevalence of AChRAb positivity was noted to be significantly lower in the low-dose group at 76.0% (P = 0.002).

- **Daily PSL dose**: The daily PSL dose was significantly higher in the intermediate-dose group (7.1 ± 5.8 mg, P < 0.0001) compared to the other groups, while no significant difference was noted between the high-dose (4.5 ± 5.1 mg) and low-dose groups (4.8 ± 3.2 mg).

- **Pyridostigmine dosing**: The high-dose group had a daily pyridostigmine dose of 58.2 ± 79.4 mg, which was significantly lower (P = 0.003) than the 80.7 ± 77.7 mg observed in the intermediate-dose group.

The study found no significant differences in MuSKAb-positive rates, postintervention status, combination of CNIs, or daily dose of tacrolimus between the groups.

### Treatment of refractory myasthenia: "rebooting" with high-dose cyclophosphamide [^114A6pHs]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who do not respond to conventional immunotherapeutic agents or cannot tolerate their side effects are considered "refractory". Ablation of the immune system followed by bone marrow transplant has been shown to cure experimental MG in rats. It is now known that immunoablative treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide does not damage hematopoietic "stem cells", permitting repopulation of the immune system without bone marrow transplant. Recent evidence indicates that this treatment can induce durable remissions in autoimmune diseases.

We treated three myasthenic patients, for whom treatment with thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and conventional immunotherapeutic agents failed, by using high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day intravenously for 4 days) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. All three patients tolerated the treatment well and have had marked improvement in myasthenic weakness, permitting reduction of immunosuppressive medication to minimal levels. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels decreased in two AChR antibody-positive patients, and anti-MuSK antibody levels decreased in one "AChR antibody-negative" patient. The patients have been followed for up to 3.5 years, with no recurrence of symptoms. High-dose cyclophosphamide treatment appears to be an effective and safe treatment for selected patients with refractory MG. Further follow-up of these and additional patients will be needed to determine whether the benefit is durable.

### Calcitriol [^112rZ77J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Calcitriol injection is intended for intravenous administration only. The optimal dose must be carefully determined for each patient, and its effectiveness relies on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate and appropriate daily calcium intake. Adults require a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 800 mg of calcium. To ensure adequate intake, physicians should prescribe a calcium supplement or provide dietary guidance.

For initial dosing, depending on the severity of hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg of calcitriol is administered intravenously three times weekly, approximately every other day. Initial doses can range from 0.5 mcg to 4 mcg three times weekly. If there is no satisfactory response, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two- to four-week intervals. During this titration period, serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be monitored at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia or a serum calcium times phosphate product greater than 70 is observed, the drug should be immediately discontinued until these parameters normalize. The calcitriol injection may then be reinitiated at a lower dose.

Doses may need reduction as parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels decrease in response to therapy. Incremental dosing should be individualized, taking into account PTH, serum calcium, and phosphorus levels.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^113G69mB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

We examined the correlation between the dosing regimen of oral prednisolone (PSL) and the achievement of minimal manifestation status or better on PSL ≤ 5 mg/day lasting > 6 months (the treatment target) in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (MG).

- **Methods**: We classified 590 patients with generalised MG into high-dose (n = 237), intermediate-dose (n = 187), and low-dose (n = 166) groups based on the oral PSL dosing regimen. Clinical characteristics, previous treatments other than PSL, and prognosis were compared between the three groups. The effect of the oral PSL dosing regimen on achieving the treatment target was followed for 3 years of treatment.

- **Results**: To achieve the treatment target, odds ratios (ORs) for low-dose versus high-dose regimens were 10.4 (P < 0.0001) after 1 year of treatment, 2.75 (P = 0.007) after 2 years, and 1.86 (P = 0.15) after 3 years; and those for low-dose versus intermediate-dose regimens were 13.4 (P < 0.0001) after 1 year, 3.99 (P = 0.0003) after 2 years, and 4.92 (P = 0.0004) after 3 years. Early combined use of fast-acting treatment (OR: 2.19 after 2 years, P = 0.02; OR: 2.11 after 3 years, P = 0.04) or calcineurin inhibitors (OR: 2.09 after 2 years, P = 0.03; OR: 2.36 after 3 years, P = 0.02) was positively associated with the achievement of the treatment target.

- **Conclusion**: A low-dose PSL regimen with early combination of other treatment options may ensure earlier achievement of the treatment target in generalised MG.

- **Risk of steroid side effects in children**: Children are at particular risk of steroid side effects, including growth failure, poor bone mineralization, and susceptibility to infection, due in part to a delay in live vaccinations. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids should use the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects.

- **Maintenance PLEX or IVIg**: These are alternatives to IS drugs in JMG.

MG with MuSK antibodies.

- **Response to ChEIs and corticosteroids**: Many patients with MuSK-MG respond poorly to ChEIs, and conventional pyridostigmine doses frequently induce side effects. Patients appear to respond well to corticosteroids and to many steroid-sparing IS agents, although they tend to remain dependent on prednisone despite concomitant treatment with steroid-sparing agents.

- **Response to PLEX and IVIg**: MuSK-MG responds well to PLEX, while IVIg seems to be less effective.

- **Consideration of rituximab**: Rituximab should be considered as an early therapeutic option in patients with MuSK-MG who have an unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy.

### Special issue: Abstracts of the 11th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, Helsinki, Finland [^117KHX8U]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The Center for Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis at People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, China, conducted this study. High-dose glucocorticoid pulse (IVMP) is an effective treatment for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG); however, early treatment may cause transient aggravation, with some patients experiencing an MG crisis. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod combined with different doses of IVMP in gMG patients.

- **Background and aims**: Myasthenia gravis patients treated at Shijiazhuang People's Hospital from December 2023 to May 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received efgartigimod (D1, D8) combined with IVMP or IVMP alone. Efficacy was assessed using the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMG) at baseline, 2 weeks, and 12 weeks.

- **Methods**: A total of 57 patients were included: 20 in the 1000 mg IVMP group (A), and 7, 10, and 20 in the 1000 mg (B), 500 mg (C), and 250 mg (D) IVMP combined with efgartigimod groups, respectively. QMG scores for groups A, C, and D gradually decreased over 12 weeks. Group B showed an increase in QMG score at week 12 compared to week 2, but it remained below baseline. There was a significant difference between group A and group B at week 2 in QMG score reduction. Group A had a significantly higher incidence of transient exacerbations than groups C and D. The incidence of adverse reactions was higher in group A than in the other three groups, especially in the development of osteoporosis and electrolyte disturbances.

### Frequency and clinical features of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis [^112VQa1Y]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction with a prevalence of around 16 per 100,000. Patients are grouped according to the age at onset, presence of a specific antibody, thymus pathology, and distribution of symptoms. The majority of patients (approximately 80%) have antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), while in a small subset of patients, antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or other postsynaptic structures of the neuromuscular junction are detected. In about 5% of patients, no antibodies are found. Additionally, paraneoplastic disease can occur in patients with thymoma, leading to generalized thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis with the detection of AChR-antibodies in nearly all patients.

The natural, untreated course of myasthenia gravis has been associated with a high mortality and persistence of symptoms in most patients. However, the introduction of immunosuppressive treatments, thymectomy in selected patients, modern intensive care medicine, as well as the availability of rescue treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange therapy (PLEX), or immunoadsorption (IA), has greatly improved the outcome across all subgroups of patients. Approximately 10–15% of patients still show a poor response to available standard treatments and consequently continue to suffer from disabling symptoms. They also experience frequent disease exacerbations, which lead to a reduced quality of life and frequent admissions to hospitals.

### Myasthenia gravis in 2025: Five new things and four hopes for the future [^115oPC1i]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Biomarkers are advancing toward precision treatment in MG. While numerous exploratory biomarkers are under investigation, including some mentioned in a now-deleted Table 2, most remain distant from clinical use. For instance, despite significant research activity and some emerging profiles, circulating miRNAs still require multicenter laboratory standardization and further studies to gain validity. The biomarkers most studied and closest to clinical utility include the circulating immune cell repertoire and the humoral response.

- **B cell subsets**: Routinely measured in clinical practice, especially in conjunction with Rituximab use. Recent and ongoing trial designs incorporate IgG levels and immune cell characterization.

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: Certain polymorphisms may predict therapeutic responses. For example, fragment c gamma receptor 3A (FCGR3A) polymorphisms are known to affect Rituximab relapses and necessitate re-dosing in Korean patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Similarly, a missense mutation in C5, specifically c.2654G > A, conferring a p. Arg885His polymorphism, was found to abolish Eculizumab binding, leading to a poor response in Japanese and Chinese patients.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded as an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission because:

- **Auto-antibody depositions**: Auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
- **Antibody transfer**: Autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents.
- **Active immunization**: Active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease.
- **Therapies**: Antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG, as siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG, reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar, and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate, and severe manifestations. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles, including the M. levator palpebrae, and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating, or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to develop…

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113Go8Pg]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Conversely, from the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is downregulated by 1,25(OH) 2 D in animal models. Thus, vitamin D deficiency might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases. Observational studies have suggested this effect might apply to humans. The VITAL RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, and at least eight large MR studies all agree that genetically predicted lower 25(OH)D levels increased the risk of developing multiple sclerosis either during adolescence or adulthood. In any case, the low number of intervention studies conducted so far does not allow for clarification of the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. However, these studies, at the time of writing, seem promising.

### Regulatory function of CD4+CD25++ T cells in patients with myasthenia gravis is associated with phenotypic changes and STAT5 signaling: 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates the suppressor activity [^113257FP]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Regulatory T cells were investigated in early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) myasthenia gravis patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-MG). Alterations in PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD4(+)CD25(++) (Treg) and responder T cells (Tresp, CD4(+)CD25(-)) were observed in LOMG patients. GITR was decreased on CD4(+)CD25(++) of all patients. Decrease of FOXP3 was associated with lower phosphorylation of STAT5. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3) increased suppression in co-culture with a stronger effect in patients by acting possibly both on cell groups. Changes in surface molecules and intracellular pathways contribute to the defects of Treg in non-thymomatous AChR-MG, and VitD3 can have modulatory effects.

### Low and high doses of ursolic acid ameliorate experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis through different pathways [^111cskEH]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, especially inhibiting IL-17. We found that UA ameliorated the symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), a rat model of MG. Although both the low and high doses of UA shifted Th17 to Th2 cytokines, other mechanisms were dose-dependent. The low dose enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas the high dose up-regulated Treg cells and reduced the concentrations of IgG2b antibodies. These findings suggest a new strategy to treat EAMG and even human MG.

### Vitamin D and autoimmunity: New aetiological and therapeutic considerations [^1133cdAu]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is frequently prescribed by rheumatologists to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Several observations have shown that vitamin D inhibits proinflammatory processes by suppressing the enhanced activity of immune cells that take part in the autoimmune reaction. Moreover, recent evidence strongly suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be therapeutically beneficial, particularly for Th1-mediated autoimmune disorders. Some reports imply that vitamin D may even be preventive in certain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. It seems that vitamin D has crossed the boundaries of calcium metabolism and has become a significant factor in a number of physiological functions, specifically as a biological inhibitor of inflammatory hyperactivity.

### Correlation of quantitative myasthenia gravis and myasthenia gravis activities of daily living scales in the MGTX study [^1148JzJm]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

**Methods**: The MGTX was a multicenter, international, rater-blinded, randomized, 3-year clinical trial followed by a voluntary 2-year extension for patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody–positive myasthenia gravis (MG) without thymoma. A total of 126 participants were enrolled and randomized: 66 to the thymectomy-plus-prednisone treatment (TPP) group and 60 to the prednisone-alone (PA) group. All participants in the trial received high-dose, alternate-day prednisone on a predefined titration and tapering schedule based on the achievement of minimal manifestation status (MMS). Minimal manifestation status was defined as having "no symptoms or functional limitations from myasthenia gravis, but there may be some weakness on examination of some muscles". The protocol prescribed thymectomy to be performed within 30 days for those randomized to the TPP group. Study-blind raters assessed the participants at baseline and from month 3 onward up to 60 months. The detailed protocol of the MGTX trial and results have been published elsewhere.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113Nq6E5]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

However, active thymopoiesis in thymomas occurs under conditions favoring autoimmunity: thymomas exhibit defective expression of the autoimmune regulator AIRE that normally drives 'promiscuous' expression of peripheral tissue autoantigens (including the AChR α-subunit) in thymic epithelial cells, and thymomas have reduced or absent thymic myoid cells. Moreover, neoplastic epithelial cells variably express striational antigen epitopes, including epitopes of titin and various AChR subunits (but not whole receptors) together with reduced levels of MHC-class II. These altered properties of neoplastic epithelial cells may profoundly interfere with (positive and negative) selection of maturing thymocytes and the activation status of mature T cells. Moreover, in concert with reduced levels of AIRE, these alterations result in defective generation of regulatory T cells by thymomas. Together, these alterations of the thymic microenvironment favor the export of substantial numbers of naïve and pre-primed auto-reactive T cells into the periphery, which are expected to gradually replace the patient's native, more tolerant T cell repertoire in the periphery. In the peripheral lymphatic tissue, they apparently stimulate the pathogenic B cell response after appropriate activation. This usually happens before, but rarely also after, thymoma resection. This impact of the thymoma on the peripheral immune system explains why TAMG, once initiated, is self-sustaining even after complete thymoma removal (that is typically accompanied by resection of the residual thymus).

When managing myasthenia gravis in specific circumstances, particularly in pediatric patients, the MGFA 2016 guidelines emphasize recognizing the increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. These side effects include growth failure, poor bone mineralization, and a heightened susceptibility to infection, partly due to a delay in live vaccinations. It is recommended to use the lowest effective dose of corticosteroids for long-term treatment to minimize these side effects.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, "Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management", in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on managing vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, resulting in inconsistent clinical practice. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians.

- **Recommendations**: It recommends measuring serum 25(OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

- **Routine testing**: Routine vitamin D testing is deemed unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned.

- **Serum 25OHD thresholds**: The guideline sets the serum 25OHD threshold at 50 nmol/L as sufficient for almost the whole population.

- **Treatment**: For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended. Fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy are suggested when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. However, loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent.

- **Monitoring**: For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be considered.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^113mvXMY]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Kaplan–Meier curves illustrate the first achievement of the treatment target (minimal manifestations or better with 5 mg for ≥ 6 months) in both the early fast-acting treatment (EFT) and non-EFT groups. Baseline cumulative hazard curves represent the EFT and non-EFT groups, excluding the effects of covariables as a function of time. EFT stands for early fast-acting treatment, and MM represents minimal manifestations.

Figure 2(B) presents the baseline cumulative hazard curves for the EFT and non-EFT groups, evaluating the function of time while excluding the effects of covariables.

- **Differences between low-dose and high-dose regimens in EFT patients**: Table 3 compares characteristics and therapies utilized for the EFT-treated patients combined with either low- or high-dose prednisolone (PSL) regimens. At their worst, symptoms were more severe (P < 0.0001), the duration of immune treatment was longer (P < 0.0001), and the frequency of thymectomy was higher (P < 0.01) in the patients receiving the high-dose PSL regimen. The severity (QMG), MG-QOL15-J score, and percentage of patients achieving MM-or-better-5mg for ≥ 6 months did not differ between the two groups.

- **Differences in background and therapies utilized**: Although the maximum dose of PSL during the disease course was significantly higher and the duration of taking PSL at a dose of ≥ 20 mg was longer in the high-dose PSL group (P < 0.0001), there was no difference concerning the dose of oral PSL and the frequency of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) use between the two groups. In the low-dose PSL group, only one patient received ≥ 20 mg.
