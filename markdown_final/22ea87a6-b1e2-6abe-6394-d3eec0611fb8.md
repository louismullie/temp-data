## Question

Treatment of diverticulitis as outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, including who qualifies, how to monitor, whether antibiotics are needed, what to prescribe if antibiotics are used, and how to handle special situations like small abscesses or older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should verify patient selection criteria for outpatient care. Next, I will examine the evidence for outpatient versus inpatient management and the role of antibiotics. After that, I need to outline a practical outpatient protocol, including follow-up and safety netting. Finally, I should consider special populations, documentation, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and diagnosis. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant pain, localized tenderness, and may include low-grade fever or leukocytosis; complicated disease includes abscess, free perforation, fistula, obstruction, or generalized peritonitis, which generally precludes outpatient care and mandates inpatient management and often intervention, so I need to ensure we are not missing those features before proceeding [^95ef38c6] [^117c9a3a]. I should confirm that imaging is used when diagnostic uncertainty exists or complications are suspected; CT is highly accurate and guides staging and disposition, though I need to balance radiation and cost with clinical judgment and local practice patterns [^b0d870f4] [^4de71b92].

> Next, I should review patient selection for outpatient management. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check that the patient is immunocompetent, hemodynamically stable, able to tolerate oral intake, has no signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response, and has reliable social support and follow-up. These are consistent across major guidelines and reviews, and they align with the RCT and observational data showing safety in selected patients [^95ef38c6] [^97a53719] [^95be4a62]. I should double-check that exclusions include immunosuppression, significant unstable comorbidities, inability to take liquids, or unreliable follow-up, as these shift risk toward inpatient care [^95ef38c6] [^97a53719].

> I will now examine the evidence for outpatient versus inpatient management. The multicenter DIVER randomized trial showed no difference in treatment failure between outpatient and inpatient strategies, with substantially lower costs in the outpatient arm, supporting safety and cost-effectiveness in appropriately selected patients [^aba8f89e]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of cost savings; the trial reported approximately threefold lower costs with outpatient care, which is consistent with guideline summaries citing 35–83% cost reductions in other contexts, though I should note the latter figures are indirect and lower-certainty [^aba8f89e] [^af5dd991]. Observational cohorts and meta-analyses report low outpatient failure rates around 4–6% and similar recurrence risks compared with inpatient care, reinforcing the feasibility of outpatient management when patients are carefully selected and monitored [^cb0921f7] [^77ff703e].

> Now, I need to consider antibiotics. Historically, antibiotics were routine, but wait, I should verify the current stance. Contemporary guidelines and randomized trials support selective rather than routine antibiotic use for uncomplicated disease in immunocompetent patients with close follow-up, given no clear benefit of antibiotics on complications, recurrence, or quality of life in many settings [^95ef38c6] [^549aeb7a] [^4de71b92]. The DINAMO RCT demonstrated that nonantibiotic outpatient care was noninferior to amoxicillin–clavulanate for hospitalization, revisits, and pain control, supporting an antibiotic-sparing approach in mild, uncomplicated cases with reliable follow-up [^4db5d0b9]. I should confirm exceptions: give antibiotics for immunocompromised hosts, significant comorbidities, frailty, systemic inflammatory response, or when symptoms are refractory or CRP/WBC are markedly elevated, aligning with AGA and ACP guidance [^1c5eecb0] [^81b90ac7].

> If antibiotics are indicated, I need to ensure appropriate regimens and duration. Let me think about outpatient choices: amoxicillin–clavulanate is a common first-line oral agent providing gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; alternatives include a fluoroquinolone combined with metronidazole, though I should avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to FDA warnings and preferentially choose amoxicillin–clavulanate when suitable, with typical durations of 4–7 days when source control is not needed [^f627c32c] [^9f0b81d1]. Hold on, I should verify that shorter validated courses exist; yes, a 4-day IV course was noninferior to 7 days in one RCT, but that inpatient IV evidence cannot be directly extrapolated to outpatient oral therapy, so I will keep 4–7 days as standard for oral outpatient regimens pending stronger outpatient-specific duration data [^1960ceab].

> Next, I should review a practical outpatient protocol. I need to ensure clear return precautions, diet, analgesia, and follow-up. A reasonable approach is a clear liquid diet for 24–48 hours with advancement as tolerated, acetaminophen or NSAIDs if no contraindications for pain, and antiemetics as needed; I should confirm that opioids are minimized due to constipation risk and that patients receive written instructions on red flags and when to seek urgent care [^notfound]. Follow-up should be arranged within 7 days, with earlier reassessment if symptoms worsen; this interval is supported by WSES and aligns with outpatient safety practices [^95be4a62]. I should double-check that patients understand to return for fever, escalating pain, vomiting, or new rectal bleeding, and that they have a 24-hour contact pathway.

> But wait, what if there is a small abscess or free air on imaging; can some of these still be managed outpatient. For abscesses under about 3–5 cm, stable patients may be managed with antibiotics alone and close follow-up, reserving percutaneous drainage for larger collections or those not improving; this is a weak recommendation with low-to-moderate quality evidence, so I need to ensure careful selection and early reassessment [^1e42fae6] [^4f7677ec]. For tiny amounts of extraluminal air without diffuse peritonitis, some guidelines allow nonoperative outpatient management with close follow-up in immunocompetent patients, but I should confirm that this remains controversial and requires shared decision-making and reliable surveillance [^3c991d62] [^786671fc].

> I should consider special populations, especially older adults. Evidence for omitting antibiotics is strongest in younger, immunocompetent patients with minimal comorbidity; in older or frail adults, I need to ensure a lower threshold for antibiotics and closer follow-up, even if the disease is technically uncomplicated, because atypical presentations and higher complication risk are common in this group [^d66821be] [^56075f2f]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse selective antibiotic use in frail patients; yes, AGA and ASCRS advise individualized decisions with consideration of comorbidities and reliability of follow-up in older adults [^d66821be].

> Documentation and shared decision-making are essential. I need to ensure the record captures the rationale for outpatient care, the absence of red flags, the follow-up plan, and the patient's preferences, including antibiotic decisions. Patient and caregiver input often favors outpatient and antibiotic-sparing strategies when safe, which should be incorporated into the plan [^8b94795e] [^795dc1e0]. I should double-check that the chart also notes imaging findings, if obtained, and explicit return precautions to mitigate medicolegal risk and support continuity of care.

> Let me synthesize a concise decision algorithm, and I will sanity-check it against the evidence before concluding. If the patient has suspected uncomplicated diverticulitis, is immunocompetent, hemodynamically stable, able to tolerate oral intake, has no systemic inflammatory response or sepsis, and has reliable follow-up, outpatient management is appropriate; if antibiotics are used, choose amoxicillin–clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole for 4–7 days, and if antibiotics are omitted, ensure close follow-up and clear safety netting, with reassessment within 7 days and earlier if deterioration occurs [^95ef38c6] [^f627c32c] [^95be4a62]. If any red flags are present — immunosuppression, unstable comorbidities, sepsis, inability to take liquids, unreliable follow-up, or complicated features such as abscess, free perforation, obstruction, or fistula — hospitalization is indicated, and I should escalate diagnostics and management accordingly [^95ef38c6] [^117c9a3a].

> In summary, I need to ensure that outpatient care remains the default for carefully selected, immunocompetent patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, that antibiotics are used selectively rather than routinely, and that follow-up and safety netting are explicit. The balance of randomized and observational evidence shows comparable failure and recurrence rates with substantial cost savings, supporting this conservative, patient-centered approach when applied with appropriate caution and close monitoring [^aba8f89e] [^cb0921f7] [^95ef38c6].

Outpatient management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is **safe and effective** for carefully selected patients [^95ef38c6], with a low failure rate of about 4–6% and no increase in recurrence or emergency surgery compared with inpatient care [^cb0921f7]. Key selection criteria include **immunocompetence**, **stable vitals**, **tolerating oral intake**, **reliable follow-up**, and **no signs of sepsis or complicated disease** [^97a53719] [^95be4a62]. Many patients can be managed without antibiotics [^549aeb7a]; when antibiotics are used, amoxicillin-clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole for 4–7 days are appropriate [^f627c32c] [^1960ceab]. Arrange follow-up within 7 days and instruct patients to return for fever, worsening pain, vomiting, or new rectal bleeding [^95be4a62].

---

## Indications for outpatient management

Outpatient care is appropriate for **acute uncomplicated diverticulitis** when the following criteria are met:

- **Immunocompetence**: No immunosuppression or significant comorbidities [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Stable vitals**: No hypotension, tachycardia, or signs of sepsis [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Oral tolerance**: Able to take liquids and medications by mouth [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Reliable follow-up**: Available for reassessment within 7 days [^95be4a62].
- **No complicated features**: No abscess, perforation, obstruction, or fistula on imaging or exam [^117c9a3a].

---

## Contraindications to outpatient management

Patients with any of the following should be **admitted** for inpatient care:

- **Complicated diverticulitis**: Abscess, perforation, obstruction, or fistula [^117c9a3a].
- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Sepsis, severe infection, or unstable vitals [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Inability to tolerate oral intake**: Persistent vomiting or severe nausea [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Lack of reliable follow-up**: No access to care or unreliable patient [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].
- **Immunosuppression or significant comorbidities**: High-risk patients [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and staging are essential. Abdominal CT with contrast is the **gold standard** to confirm uncomplicated disease and exclude complications [^b0d870f4] [^4de71b92]. Use CT when diagnostic uncertainty exists or complications are suspected [^fc24199f].

---

## Treatment protocols

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^549aeb7a]; consider withholding them in immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms and reliable follow-up [^549aeb7a] [^4db5d0b9]. When antibiotics are indicated, use agents with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage for 4–7 days:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID |
| Ciprofloxacin + metronidazole | 500 mg PO BID + 500 mg PO TID |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + metronidazole | 160/800 mg PO BID + 500 mg PO TID |

---

### Supportive care

Supportive measures include a **clear liquid diet** with advancement as tolerated, acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain (avoid opioids when possible), and antiemetics for nausea [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **follow-up within 7 days** to assess clinical improvement and detect complications early [^95be4a62]. Provide clear return precautions for fever, worsening pain, vomiting, or rectal bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Outcomes and effectiveness

Outpatient management is **highly effective**, with low failure rates and no increase in recurrence or emergency surgery:

- **Failure rate**: 4–6% (most failures are managed with antibiotics or admission; rare need for surgery) [^cb0921f7] [^77ff703e].
- **Recurrence**: Similar to inpatient care (approximately 10–25% over 5–10 years) [^d2cdf8dd] [^6d0df3c7].
- **Patient satisfaction**: High, with improved quality of life and lower healthcare costs [^aba8f89e] [^af5dd991].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Although generally safe, outpatient care carries a small risk of **missed complications** (abscess, perforation, obstruction) [^notfound] and treatment failure requiring admission or surgery [^cb0921f7]. Early follow-up and clear patient education mitigate these risks [^95be4a62].

---

## Patient education and self-care

Patients should be educated on:

- **Diet**: Clear liquids initially, then gradual advance to low fiber, then high fiber after recovery [^notfound].
- **Symptom monitoring**: Fever, worsening pain, vomiting, or rectal bleeding require immediate care [^notfound].
- **Medication adherence**: Complete antibiotic course if prescribed [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Keep scheduled appointment within 7 days [^95be4a62].

---

Outpatient management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is **safe and effective** when patients are carefully selected, with low failure rates and no increase in recurrence or emergency surgery. Careful patient selection, appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and close follow-up are essential to successful outpatient care [^95ef38c6].

### Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review [^77ff703e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis occurs in up to 25% of patients with diverticulosis. The majority of cases are mild or uncomplicated and it has become a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency department. On the basis of the National Inpatient Sample database from the USA, 86% of patients admitted with diverticulitis were treated with medical therapy. However, several recent studies have shown that outpatient treatment with antibiotics is safe and effective. The aim of this systematic review is to update the evidence published in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines and searched in MEDLINE and Cochrane databases all English-language articles on the management of acute diverticulitis using the following search terms: 'diverticulitis', 'outpatient', and 'uncomplicated'. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. A total of 11 articles for full review were yielded: one randomized controlled trial, eight prospective cohort studies, and two retrospective cohort studies. Treatment successful rate on an outpatient basis, which means that no further complications were reported, ranged from 91.5 to 100%. Fewer than 8% of patients were readmitted in the hospital. Intolerance to oral intake and lack of family or social support are common exclusion criteria used for this approach, whereas severe comorbidities are not definitive exclusion criteria in all the studies. Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective, and economically efficient when applying an appropriate selection in most reviewed studies.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — outpatient care: ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit of routine hospitalization, the initial (default) management can be as an outpatient and applies to most immunocompetent patients who have no evidence of systemic inflammatory response and can continue treatment at home under medical supervision with adequate family and social support and follow-up. Low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence for outpatient compared with inpatient management, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

### Current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^85494fb0]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

This paper addresses the current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis by an evidence-based review.

Method

A systematic search in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google scholar on colonic diverticulitis was performed. Diagnostic tools, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparative studies, observational epidemiological studies, national and international guidelines, reviews of observational studies on elective and emergency surgical treatment of diverticulitis, and studies of prognostic significance were reviewed. Criteria for eligibility of the studies were diagnosis and classification, medical treatment, inpatients and outpatients, diverticulitis in young patients, immunosuppression, recurrence, elective resection, emergency surgery, and predictive factors.

Results

Some 92 publications were selected for comprehensive review. The review highlighted that computed tomography is the most effective test in the diagnosis and staging of acute diverticulitis; outpatient treatment can be performed for uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients without associated comorbidities; conservative treatment is aimed at those patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis; elective surgery must be done on an individual basis; laparoscopic approach for elective treatment of diverticulitis is appropriate but may be technically complex; in perforated diverticulitis, resection with primary anastomosis is a safe procedure that requires experience and should take into account strict exclusion criteria.

Conclusion

The heterogeneity of patients with colonic diverticular disease means that both elective and urgent treatment should be tailored on an individual basis.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

Timing and setting — KQs and populations are defined for this guideline. Timing specifies KQ 1 as any and KQ 2 as minimum follow-up equal to treatment duration (hospitalization, antibiotic use). Setting for KQs 1 and 2 includes inpatient, emergency department (or equivalent), and outpatient. Target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adult patients with suspected or known acute left sided colonic diverticulitis.

ACP clinical guideline — site of care for acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis states that ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit in routine hospitalization for patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, the initial (default) management of uncomplicated diverticulitis can be as an outpatient, and patients should have adequate family or social support and follow-up. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence after outpatient compared with inpatient management, and the available evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for most critical and important outcomes (including emergency surgery, mortality, quality of life, and treatment failure), but few patients had these outcomes after management in outpatient or inpatient settings. The CGC also judged that outpatient management would likely have lower associated costs than inpatient management, with indirect evidence from outside the United States suggesting a cost savings of 35% to 83% per episode of acute diverticulitis. This recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

### Outpatient treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^6d555f3f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally, treatment of acute diverticulitis has mostly been based on inpatient care. The question arises whether these patients can be treated on an outpatient basis as the admissions for diverticular disease have been shown to be increasing every year. We studied whether outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is feasible and safe, and which patients could benefit from outpatient care.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was carried out in two teaching hospitals using hospital registry codes for diverticulitis. All patients diagnosed with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis between January 2004 and January 2012, confirmed by imaging or colonoscopy, were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis (Hinchey stages 2, 3, and 4), and right-sided diverticulitis. Inpatient care was compared with outpatient care. Primary outcome was admission for outpatient care and the complication rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis was carried out to identify potential factors for inpatient care.

Results

Of 627 patients with diverticulitis, a total of 312 consecutive patients were identified with primary uncomplicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon; 194 patients had been treated as inpatients and 118 patients primarily as outpatients. In this last group, 91.5% had been treated successfully without diverticulitis-related complications or the need for hospital admission during a mean follow-up period of 48 months.

Conclusion

Despite inherent patient selection in a retrospective cohort, ambulatory treatment of patients presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis seems feasible and safe. In mildly ill and younger patients, hospital admission can be avoided.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^fc24199f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Q3.2 What are the optimal non - operative strategies in the management of uncomplicated AD?

Statement: In immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, symptomatic treatment without antibiotics provides similar outcomes to treatment with antibiotics.

Recommendation: A trial of non-antibiotic therapy can be considered with appropriate follow-up in select immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. (LoE: high. Strength of recommendation: weak).

Membership survey results: Yes 509 (59.12%).

228 members (26.48%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 199 (23.11%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 434 (50.41%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Since there was no majority agreement on either the statement of recommendation nor the likelihood that the recommendation would change practice, further voting was carried out at SAGES and EAES meetings. Agreement with the recommendation was achieved in 61.7% (129/209) and 70.8% (90/127) and with likelihood to change practice in 46% (98/212) and 71% (80/122) among SAGES and EAES members, respectively.

Consensus was not reached on the recommendation nor its likelihood to change practice.

Statement: Immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be managed in the outpatient setting.

Recommendation: Immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and mild symptoms may be managed in the outpatient setting. (LoE: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak).

Management of complicated diverticulitis

Need for hospitalization

Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses support the safety of treating patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis in the outpatient setting, though patients with significant comorbidities or immunosuppression are often excluded. Just 2 studies to date examining outpatient therapy for diverticulitis have included patients with any complicated disease. Joliat et al included stable patients with mild complicated diverticulitis (defined as abscess < 4 cm or pneumoperitoneum < 2 cm) in their retrospective outpatient study and determined it was safe to manage this group as outpatients with close follow up. Sirany et al also retrospectively analyzed patients with diverticulitis and found a very small subset (n = 6) who had complicated disease and were discharged home from the emergency department with a 50% readmission rate, thus preventing the authors from drawing any conclusions about the safety of managing patients with complicated disease in the outpatient setting. Further work is needed to determine which subgroups of patients with complicated diverticulitis may be appropriate for outpatient care.

Non-operative therapy

Non-operative and/or percutaneous management of complicated diverticulitis has long been favored for stable patients. Internationally, mixed guidelines exist on the role of elective resection following non-operative treatment of complicated disease. Generally, the literature supports the fact that patients who do not have resections following the treatment of complicated disease will go on to have recurrent episodes, if not ongoing smoldering symptoms. However, additional outcomes are less well studied.

A recent retrospective review of Swiss and Scottish patients from 2005–2015 attempted to answer the question of whether elective interval resection for initially non-operatively managed complicated diverticulitis is associated with adverse outcomes. While 25% of Swiss and 5% of Scottish patients underwent interval resection, the authors found no difference in the rates of emergency surgical intervention or death between the populations (5% in both groups). The authors challenged the routine recommendation of prophylactic surgery following nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis, as is the current practice according to German and American guidelines. An RCT is needed to determine the long-term safety of non-operative treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^9d0eb54d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — outpatient vs. inpatient management in adults: Adults with acute complicated or uncomplicated diverticulitis, whether first or recurrent episode were evaluated. For elective surgery, there may be no differences in associated risk when comparing outpatient management vs. inpatient management (crude OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.21 to 2.77]). For recurrence, there may be no differences in associated risk when comparing outpatient management vs. inpatient management (crude OR, 0.85 [CI, 0.5 to 1.43]). Certainty of evidence LOW is reported for these outcomes, and evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for the following critical outcomes: emergency surgery, mortality, treatment failure, quality of life.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^5b5edf6b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

### Triage of patients with acute diverticulitis: are some inpatients candidates for outpatient treatment? [^ec78e07c]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Current recommendations regarding the triage of patients with acute diverticulitis for inpatient or outpatient treatment are vague. We hypothesized that a significant number of patients treated as an inpatient could be managed as an outpatient.

Method

A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 639 patients admitted for a first episode of diverticulitis. The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT). The endpoints included length of stay, need for surgery, percutaneous drainage and mortality. Patients were considered to have had a minimal hospitalization, defined as survival to discharge without needing a procedure, hospitalization of ≤ 3 days and no readmission for diverticulitis within 30 days after discharge.

Results

Of 639 patients, 368 (57.6%) had a minimal hospitalization. Female gender and CT scan findings of free air/fluid were negatively associated with the likelihood of minimal hospitalization. The presence of an abscess < 3 cm and stranding on CT did not predict the need for a higher level of care. Despite the statistical significance of several patient-level predictors, the model did not identify patients likely to need only minimal hospitalization.

Conclusion

Most patients admitted with acute diverticulitis are discharged after minimal hospitalization. Free air/liquid in a patient admitted for acute diverticulitis indicates a more severe clinical course.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^3e17707b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sigmoid diverticulitis is an increasingly common Western disease associated with a high morbidity and cost of treatment. Improvement in the understanding of the disease process, along with advances in the diagnosis and medical management has led to recent changes in treatment recommendations. The natural history of diverticulitis is more benign than previously thought, and current trends favor more conservative, less invasive management. Despite current recommendations of more restrictive indications for surgery, practice trends indicate an increase in elective operations being performed for the treatment of diverticulitis. Due to diversity in disease presentation, in many cases, optimal surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis remains unclear with regard to patient selection, timing, and technical approach in both elective and urgent settings. As a result, data is limited to mostly retrospective and non-randomized studies. This review addresses the current treatment recommendations for surgical management of diverticulitis, highlighting technical aspects and patterns of care.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^f558a6f3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colonic diverticulosis is extremely common in Western countries. Prevalence increases with age, and is estimated to affect approximately 70% of individuals by age 80. Manifestations of diverticular disease, which include diverticulitis, bleeding, abscess, free perforation, fistula, and stricture formation account for significant disease burden and are frequently associated with poor outcomes, including mortality. Furthermore, hospitalizations for acute diverticulitis are increasing, leading to escalating costs in the US, now estimated to exceed 2.4 billion dollars annually.

Our evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease, as well as improvements in diagnostic imaging and nonsurgical management of the disease have led to significant changes in treatment recommendations. Less aggressive medical and surgical treatments have been proposed. In cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, outpatient management has been advocated for, and the use of antibiotics challenged. Similarly, in cases of complicated diverticulitis, nonsurgical management is preferred initially, including percutaneous drainage of abscesses, given the high morbidity and mortality of urgent operations. Maintenance of intestinal continuity via primary anastomosis and the use of minimally invasive approaches are advocated for in elective and urgent settings.

Current practice guidelines are tailored to the individual patient, taking into account risk factors, disease severity on initial presentation, persistent symptoms, and patient preferences. Technical aspects of the various surgical treatments are left to the discretion of the individual surgeon. This review will highlight both current surgical recommendations and practice trends.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^eb06a516]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Could patients with uncomplicated ALCD be treated as outpatient?

We suggest management in an outpatient setting for patients with uncomplicated ALCD and no comorbidities. We suggest re-evaluation within 7 days. If the clinical condition deteriorates, re-evaluation should be carried out earlier (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis symptoms without significant comorbidities, who are able to take fluids orally and manage themselves at home, can be treated as outpatients. They should be re-evaluated within 7 days from the time of the diagnosis. However, if the clinical condition deteriorates, re-evaluation should be carried out earlier. Patients with significant comorbidities and unable to take fluids orally should be treated in hospital with intravenous fluids.

Etzioni et al. in 2010 published a retrospective analysis, demonstrating that outpatient treatment was effective for the vast majority (94%) of patients suffering from acute diverticulitis. A systematic review on outpatient management of acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis was recently published. Jackson et al. concluded that current evidence suggested that a more progressive, ambulatory-based approach to the majority of cases of acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis was justified. Rodríguez-Cerrillo et al. have recently shown that also elderly patients with comorbidities can be safely treated at home avoiding hospital admission.

The DIVER trial has demonstrated that outpatient treatment may be safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and can reduce the costs without negatively influencing the quality of life of these patients. This multicenter, RCT included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All the patients underwent abdominal CT. The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department, and then, patients were either admitted to hospital or discharged. Among a total of 132 patients, four patients in those admitted to hospital and three patients in those discharged to home management developed treatment failure (there were no differences between the groups (p = 0.62)). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times less in the outpatient treated group, with significant costs savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^b0d870f4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^cb0921f7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A systematic review including 21 studies (11 prospective, 9 retrospective, and only 1 randomized trial) with 1781 patients who had outpatient management of ALCD was recently published. The meta-analysis concluded that outpatient management is safe, and the overall failure rate in an outpatient setting was 4.3% (95% CI 2.6–6.3%). Location of diverticulitis is not a selection criterion for an outpatient strategy (p = 0.512). The other subgroup analyses did not report any factors that influence the rate of failure: previous episodes of acute diverticulitis (p = 0.163), comorbidities (p = 0.187), pericolic gas (p = 0.653), intra-abdominal abscess (p = 0.326), treatment according to a registered protocol (p = 0.078), type of follow-up (p = 0.700), type of antibiotic treatment (p = 0.647), or diabetes (p = 0.610). In patients who failed outpatient treatment, the majority had prolonged antibiotic therapy and only few had percutaneous drainage for an abscess (0.13%) or surgical intervention for perforation (0.06%). However, these results should be interpreted with some caution because of the low quality of available data. The data reported suggested that outpatient management is safe if associated with an accurate selection of patients (40%); no subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences between groups (including comorbidities, previous episode and diabetes). The main limitations of the findings of the present review concern their applicability in common clinical practice as it was impossible to identify strict criteria of failure.

Another review about outpatient management of ALCD was published in 2017. The search yielded 192 publications. Of these, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria including 1 RCT, 6 clinical controlled trials, and 3 case series. There was no difference in failure rates of medical treatment (6.5 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.32) or in recurrence rates (13.0 vs. 12.1%, p = 0.81) between those receiving ambulatory care and inpatient care for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Ambulatory treatment was associated with an estimated daily cost savings of between €600 and €1,900 per patient treated. Meta-analysis of data was not possible due to heterogeneity in study designs and inclusion criteria.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1e42fae6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guideline — management of diverticular abscess: Image-guided percutaneous drainage is usually recommended for stable patients with abscesses > 3 cm in size (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation occurs in 15% to 40% of patients who present with acute sigmoid diverticulitis, and nonoperative treatment with either antibiotics alone or with percutaneous drainage is successful in up to 80% of cases. Treatment failure is typically defined as requiring surgery, developing worsening sepsis, or having a recurrent abscess within 30 days. Antibiotic treatment alone for abscesses smaller than 3 cm is typically successful and, in stable patients, treatment can usually be administered in the outpatient setting; however, for larger abscesses (> 3 cm) antibiotics alone have a much higher failure rate (up to 34%). Although recurrence after antibiotic treatment ranges from 25% to 60% of patients, recurrence after percutaneous drainage is significantly lower (15%–25%). Patients without a safe access window for percutaneous drainage or who do not respond to medical treatment including percutaneous drainage should typically be considered for surgery, and laparoscopic abscess drainage rather than surgical resection can be considered in certain cases.

Diverticulitis

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (Recommendation 2C).

The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is a point of controversy in the medical community.

In 2011, a systematic review was published overviewing antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis were sparse and of poor methodological quality. There was no concrete evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence.

However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms.

Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis depends on the condition and compliance of the patient as well as his or her availability for follow-up analysis. The treatment involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be admitted for more aggressive inpatient treatment.

Hospitalized patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotic infusion.

The clinical value of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis is poorly understood by the medical community and therefore merits further study.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

### Outpatient versus hospitalization management for uncomplicated diverticulitis: a prospective, multicenter randomized clinical trial (DIVER trial) [^aba8f89e]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We compare the results of 2 different strategies for the management of patients with uncomplicated left colonic diverticulitis and to analyze differences in quality of life and economic costs.

Background

The most frequent standard management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis still is hospital admission both in Europe and United States.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized controlled trial included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All the patients underwent abdominal computed tomography. There were 2 strategies of management: hospitalization (group 1) and outpatient (group 2). The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department and then group 1 patients were hospitalized whereas patients in group 2 were discharged. The primary end point was the treatment failure rate of the outpatient protocol and need for hospital admission. The secondary end points included quality-of-life assessment and evaluation of costs.

Results

A total of 132 patients were randomized: 4 patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2 presented treatment failure without differences between the groups (P = 0.619). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times lower in group 2, with savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

Conclusions

Outpatient treatment is safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Outpatient treatment allows important costs saving to the health systems without negative influence on the quality of life of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^c33fdfba]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^83735300]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention of acute diverticulitis

Primary prevention of acute diverticulitis is a very important topic. Acute diverticulitis, defined as acute inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, is a common emergency presentation managed by both surgeons and physicians. Factors predisposing to the development of acute diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and medication use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

There have been advances in the medical treatments offered to patients in recent years. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis are generally treated as outpatients with a clear liquid diet and antibiotics. In outpatients, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually given for 7–10 days. If opioid analgesics are required for pain control, meperidine is the preferred option since morphine causes colonic spasm and may accentuate colonic hyper-segmentation.

Outpatient treatment is effective in most cases, and less than 10% of patients are readmitted at the emergency room for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation. Hospitalization with intravenous antibiotic treatment is usually recommended by current guidelines if the patient: is unable to take oral therapy; is affected by severe comorbidity; fails to improve with outpatient therapy; or is affected by complicated diverticulitis. Clinical improvement in patients affected by acute diverticulitis is generally observed within 3–4 days. If patients are hospitalized, a 7–10 day course of oral antibiotics is usually given following discharge. However, results of studies investigating such prevention are often conflicting.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — initial management of acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis: "ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)". For select patients with abdominal tenderness, "it is reasonable to initially manage them by observation with supportive care (for example, bowel rest and hydration) and without the use of antibiotics", and "Select patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated disease who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support". Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — initial care without antibiotics in select patients: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). "Select" patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, with no systemic inflammatory response or immunosuppression, who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications, quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics; initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment. Implementation does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess; the included studies did not report how many patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting needed antibiotics at follow-up (6, 12, 24 months and 11 years).

### Outpatient treatment of patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^773b6ff6]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Evidence supporting outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis is limited. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ambulatory treatment protocol in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Method

All patients diagnosed with uncomplicated diverticulitis based on abdominal computed tomography findings from June 2003 to December 2008 were considered for outpatient treatment. Admission was indicated in patients not able to tolerate oral intake and those with comorbidity or without adequate family support. Treatment consisted of oral antibiotics for 7 days (amoxicillin-clavulanic or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole in patients with penicillin allergy). Patients were seen again at between 4 and 7 days after starting treatment to confirm symptom improvement.

Results

Ninety-six patients were diagnosed with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and 26 presented at least one criterion for admission. Ambulatory treatment was initiated in 70 (73%) patients. Only two (3%) required admission because of persisting abdominal pain and vomiting, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics resolved the inflammatory process in both cases. In the remaining 68 (97%), ambulatory treatment was completed without complication.

Conclusion

Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective and applicable to most patients with tolerance to oral intake and without severe comorbidity and having appropriate family support.

### Outpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis: rates and predictors of failure [^8138a8c7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many patients with acute diverticulitis can be managed as outpatients, but the success rate of this approach has not been thoroughly studied. We analyzed a large cohort of patients treated on an outpatient basis for an initial episode of acute diverticulitis to test our hypothesis that outpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis is highly effective.

Methods

We analyzed patients within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system (from 2006 to 2007) who were diagnosed with an initial episode of diverticulitis during an emergency room visit and subsequently discharged home. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for diagnosis or for confirmation of a diagnosis, and each radiologic report was evaluated regarding the presence of free fluid, phlegmon, perforation, and abscess. Treatment failure was defined as a return to the emergency room or an admission for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation.

Results

Our study included 693 patients, of whom 54% were women, the average age was 58.5 years, and 6% failed treatment. In multivariate analysis, women (odds ratio, 3.08 [95% CI, 1.31–7.28]) and patients with free fluid on CT scan (odds ratio, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.45–7.05]) were at significantly higher risk for treatment failure. Age, white blood cell count, Charlson score, and duration of antibiotics were not significant predictive factors.

Conclusions

In a retrospective analysis, among a cohort of patients who were referred for outpatient treatment, we found that such treatment was effective for the vast majority (94%) of patients. Women and those with free fluid on CT scan appear to be at higher risk for treatment failure.

### Diagnostic imaging and medical management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^4de71b92]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians need to better understand the value of computed tomography (CT) imaging and nonsurgical treatment options to manage acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Purpose

To evaluate CT imaging, outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotic treatment, and interventional radiology for patients with complicated diverticulitis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 January 1990 through 16 November 2020.

Study Selection

Existing systematic reviews of CT imaging accuracy, as well as randomized trials and adjusted nonrandomized comparative studies reporting clinical or patient-centered outcomes.

Data Extraction

6 researchers extracted study data and risk of bias, which were verified by an independent researcher. The team assessed strength of evidence across studies.

Data Synthesis

Based on moderate-strength evidence, CT imaging is highly accurate for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. For patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, 6 studies provide low-strength evidence that initial outpatient and inpatient management have similar risks for recurrence or elective surgery, but they provide insufficient evidence regarding other outcomes. Also, for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, 5 studies comparing antibiotics versus no antibiotics provide low-strength evidence that does not support differences in risks for treatment failure, elective surgery, recurrence, posttreatment complications, and other outcomes. Evidence is insufficient to determine choice of antibiotic regimen (7 studies) or effect of percutaneous drainage (2 studies).

Limitations

The evidence base is mostly of low strength. Studies did not adequately assess heterogeneity of treatment effect.

Conclusion

Computed tomography imaging is accurate for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, no differences in outcomes were found between outpatient and inpatient care. Avoidance of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be safe for most patients. The evidence is too sparse for other evaluated questions.

### Comparative effectiveness and harms of antibiotics for outpatient diverticulitis: two nationwide cohort studies [^9f0b81d1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Outpatient diverticulitis is commonly treated with either a combination of metronidazole and a fluoroquinolone (metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone) or amoxicillin-clavulanate alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised that fluoroquinolones be reserved for conditions with no alternative treatment options. The comparative effectiveness of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for diverticulitis is uncertain.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and harms of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for outpatient diverticulitis.

Design

Active-comparator, new-user, retrospective cohort studies.

Setting

Nationwide population-based claims data on U.S. residents aged 18 to 64 years with private employer-sponsored insurance (2000 to 2018) or those aged 65 years or older with Medicare (2006 to 2015).

Participants

Immunocompetent adults with diverticulitis in the outpatient setting.

Intervention

Metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Measurements

1-year risks for inpatient admission, urgent surgery, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and 3-year risk for elective surgery.

Results

In MarketScan (IBM Watson Health), new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 106 361) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 13 160) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]), 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.3 to 0.7]), or 1-year CDI risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]) between groups. In Medicare, new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 17 639) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 2709) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [CI, -0.7 to 0.9]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, -0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.6 to 0.1]), or 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, -0.3 percentage points [CI, -1.1 to 0.4]) between groups. The 1-year CDI risk was higher for metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone than for amoxicillin-clavulanate (risk difference, 0.6 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 1.0]).

Limitation

Residual confounding is possible, and not all harms associated with these antibiotics, most notably drug-induced liver injury, could be assessed.

Conclusion

Treating diverticulitis in the outpatient setting with amoxicillin-clavulanate may reduce the risk for fluoroquinolone-related harms without adversely affecting diverticulitis-specific outcomes.

### How would you manage this patient with recurrent diverticulitis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^b9451334]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute diverticulitis, which refers to inflammation or infection, or both, of a colonic diverticulum, is a common medical condition that may occur repeatedly in some persons. It most often manifests with left-sided abdominal pain, which may be associated with low-grade fever and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications may include abscess, fistula formation, perforation, and bowel obstruction. The American College of Physicians recently published practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis, the role of colonoscopy after resolution, and interventions to prevent recurrence of this condition. Among the recommendations were the use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning in cases where there was diagnostic uncertainty, initial management of uncomplicated cases in the outpatient setting without antibiotics, referral for colonoscopy after an initial episode if not performed recently, and discussion of elective surgery to prevent recurrent disease in patients with complicated diverticulitis or frequent episodes of uncomplicated disease. Here, 2 gastroenterologists with expertise in acute diverticulitis debate CT scanning for diagnosis, antibiotics for treatment, colonoscopy to screen for underlying malignancy, and elective surgery to prevent recurrent disease.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^270e7727]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory condition of pouch-like protrusions of the inner layer of the bowel, most commonly in the sigmoid colon. In 2021, diverticulitis was associated with nine billion dollars in health care costs in the United States (US), and nearly 300,000 emergency department (ED) visits. While the incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, management is in the midst of a paradigm shift with an increasing emphasis on conservative, outpatient management of uncomplicated disease.

Related to this change in management is a gradual adoption of an antibiotic-sparing approach for uncomplicated disease in select patients. This approach may be acceptable to patients and has the potential to significantly reduce the associated health care costs and the overuse of antibiotics. While this antibiotic-sparing approach is supported by data from randomized control trials and has been incorporated into guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, up to 24% of individuals experience treatment failure. These same guidelines caution that data are limited to uncomplicated disease in immunocompetent patients without significant comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, which dramatically limits the generalizability of this management strategy. Further, a recent Cochrane review cautions that the overall body of evidence regarding this practice remains limited in part due to wide confidence intervals and associated uncertainty regarding the potential benefits of antibiosis.

Overall, the widespread adoption of antibiotic-sparing approaches has not occurred, and prognosticating which patients may benefit from antibiotics remains understudied. Finally, optimal duration of treatment in patients who are offered antibiotic management without procedural source control is unknown. Given this complex and evolving landscape, exploring the patterns of antibiotic use and their associated outcomes in diverticulitis is warranted. Here, we employ a large commercial insurance claims database to examine the relationship between antibiotic use/duration and outcomes, including: subsequent antibiotic use, repeat ED visits, and surgery.

### Contemporary review of risk-stratified management in acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis [^7e20a7cb]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition. Severity of the disease is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations and dictates the need for medical or surgical intervention. Recent clinical trials have improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease resulting in new approaches to and better evidence for the management of acute diverticulitis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library (years 2004–2015), MEDLINE (years 2004–2015), and EMBASE (years 2004–2015) databases. We used the search terms "diverticulitis, colonic" or "acute diverticulitis" or "divertic" in combination with the terms "management", "antibiotics", "non-operative", or "surgery". Registers for clinical trials (such as the WHO registry and the https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched for ongoing, recruiting, or closed trials not yet published.

Results

Antibiotic treatment can be avoided in simple, non-complicated diverticulitis and outpatient management is safe. The management of complicated disease, ranging from a localized abscess to perforation with diffuse peritonitis, has changed towards either percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches in selected cases. The role of laparoscopic lavage without resection in perforated non-fecal diverticulitis is still debated; however, recent evidence from two randomised controlled trials has found a higher re-intervention in this group of patients.

Conclusions

A shift in management has occurred towards conservative management in acute uncomplicated disease. Those with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. For complicated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis, the use of peritoneal lavage appears to be non-superior to resection.

### Determinants of treatment and outcomes of diverticular abscesses [^bb379e41]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticular disease of the colon is a common ailment, especially among the elderly, present in approximately 65% of the population over 65 years of age. However, only 5% of the patients with diverticular disease develop an acute diverticulitis during their lifetimes. Most of the episodes of acute diverticulitis are uncomplicated, but 15–20% of those diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) imaging are complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess. Due to their rarity, the treatment of diverticular abscesses is not based on high-quality evidence.

Abscess size of 3–6 cm is generally accepted as a reasonable cutoff determining the choice of treatment. World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines recommend antibiotics alone for abscesses with a diameter less than 4–5 cm. Some studies have suggested that the smallest abscesses might be safely treated with only oral antibiotic in an outpatient setting or possibly even without antibiotics. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess combined with intravenous antibiotics is recommended for larger abscesses, but the evidence to support this is of low quality. No randomized controlled trials comparing the treatment of diverticular abscesses using drainage with antibiotics to antibiotics alone exist. However, data from retrospective series suggest an approximately 20% failure rate for both drainage with antibiotics and antibiotics alone. Emergency surgery is usually reserved for unstable patients or patients not responding to conservative treatment as it is associated with higher mortality (12% vs. 1.1% if treated non-operatively). However, this excess mortality might be more due to the selection bias and unmodifiable factors (sepsis or comorbidities) than the surgery itself. The aim of this study was to analyze the treatment choices and their outcomes for diverticular abscesses of different sizes.

9 Elective Surgery for Diverticulitis

Although some patients present with severe diverticulitis requiring emergency surgery, most surgery for diverticulitis occurs in the elective setting. Surgery is considered in patients with recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis, smoldering symptoms, and complications of diverticulitis such as abscess, fistula, or stricture. Patients with these manifestations of diverticulitis can be referred for a surgical consultation, but primary care providers and geriatricians play an essential role in helping patients navigate the ultimate decision of whether to undergo surgery.

For recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis, AGA and ASCRS guidelines suggest disease severity, patient preferences and individualized risks and benefits be factored into surgical treatment decisions. For patients with complicated diverticulitis involving mild stricture or fistula, emergent operations are rarely indicated, but elective surgery can improve quality of life by reducing pain and other associated symptoms. Therefore, surgical referral is appropriate for patients with complicated diverticulitis, smoldering symptoms, and recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Management of right colonic uncomplicated diverticulitis: outpatient versus inpatient management [^d4b8eef4]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Initial conservative management may be the mainstay of therapy for uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. However, definitive treatment guidelines have not yet been established. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of outpatient management versus inpatient management for preventing recurrence of this condition.

Methods

Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 103 patients were consecutively enrolled at the first attack of uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. In this prospective observational study, 40 patients underwent an outpatient management regimen consisting of oral antibiotics (for 4 days), and 63 patients underwent an inpatient management regimen that included bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics (for 7–10 days). The treatment was selected by the patient. Failure to respond to therapy and the incidence of recurrence of this condition were assessed.

Results

Both groups of patients were treated successfully, and their symptoms were relieved. The patients were followed up for a median time of 21 months. Of the 40 patients with short-term oral antibiotic therapy on an outpatient basis, disease recurrence was observed in 4 patients (10%). Of these four patients, one underwent surgery and the remaining three were treated nonoperatively. Of the 63 patients on inpatient management, recurrence was observed in 7 patients (11%). Of these seven patients, one underwent surgery and the remaining six were treated nonoperatively.

Conclusions

Outpatient management with short-term oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis is as effective as inpatient management in regard to preventing disease recurrence.

Mesalazine for treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and primary prevention of diverticulitis: results from a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (data from Picchio et al.).

The apparent colonic hypermotility in diverticular disease, suggests that antispasmodic agents might improve abdominal pain, by decreasing muscular contraction. No randomized clinical trials are, however, available to confirm this benefit.

In acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (Hinchey, stage 0 or Ia), an outpatient management is now considered the optimal approach for most patients. Oral antimicrobials are often prescribed, but recent studies found no support to the routine use of antibiotics. A recent meta-analysisactually found that antibiotic use increases the length of hospital stay but is not associated with a reduction in overall or individual complication rates. The combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole is probably the most prescribed oral treatment. Admission to hospital and intravenous antibiotics are only recommended when the patient cannot tolerate oral feeding, is affected by severe comorbidities or does not improve with outpatient treatment. Most diverticulitis-associated abscesses can be treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or percutaneous drainage. Emergency surgery is considered standard treatment only in patients with acute peritonitis (Hinchey, stages III and IV).

Non-operative treatment, with bowel rest and antibiotics, is suggested in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed as an outpatient (dietary modification and oral antibiotics) for those without appreciable fever, excessive vomiting, or marked peritonitis, as long as there is the opportunity for follow-up. The patient should be able to take liquids and antibiotics by mouth. Hospitalization is indicated if the patient is unable to take liquids or has severe pain, or if symptoms fail to improve despite adequate outpatient therapy. Antibiotics should be selected to treat the most common bacteria found in the colon: gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. Non-operative treatment will resolve acute diverticulitis in 85 percent of patients, but approximately one-third will have a recurrent attack often within one year.

The decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1 C).

The overall rate of recurrence appears to be approximately 10 to 30% within a decade after a first documented attack and that the majority of patients who have a single episode of diverticulitis will not have another. In one report involving an average follow-up of 9 years with 2551 patients whose initial episode of diverticulitis was treated successfully without surgery, only 13% had recurrent attacks and only 7% required colectomy. These observations imply that routine elective colectomy is probably unwarranted if the disease is successfully managed on initial presentation and that surgical treatment should be limited to patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative therapy. Thus, continued observation may be appropriate for most patients who have repeated attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Emergency medicine updates: acute diverticulitis [^b10aebbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with acute diverticulitis.

Diverticulitis epidemiology and health care utilization — hospitalization prevalence "increased from 74.1 of 100,000 in 2000 to a peak of 96.0 of 100,000 in 2008", with "2,151,023 hospitalizations for diverticulitis during this time period" and "an average of 195,548 admissions per year". Ambulatory care use was substantial, with "more than 2.7 million discharges in the ambulatory setting" in 2010; in 2012 there were "more than 340,000 emergency department visits" for diverticulitis and "215,560 of these patients were admitted", and admission was linked to a "median length of stay of 4 days". Using updated surveys, "in 2014 there were 1.92 million patients diagnosed with diverticular disease in the ambulatory setting". Emergency department visit rates "rose 26.8% from 89.8 to 113.9 visits per 100,000 population between 2006 and 2013", with "the aggregate national cost of these visits" reported as "$1.6 billion in 2013".

A recent Dutch randomized controlled trial of observational versus systemic antibiotic treatment (DIABOLO trial) for a first episode of CT-proven ALCD Hinchey stages 1a and 1b confirmed that observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and could be considered appropriate in these patients.

Long-term follow-up of the AVOD and DIABOLO trials on omitting antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated diverticulitis have confirmed that routine antibiotics are not beneficial. A recently published individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) of both RCTs shows that observational management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe. Some statistical uncertainty remains, but no subgroup that would benefit from antibiotic treatment is apparent.

Outpatient management is suggested for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, with no comorbidities. These patients should be clinically monitored as outpatients and re-evaluated within 7 days to assess for resolution of the inflammatory processes. Earlier revaluation is necessary if the clinical condition deteriorates.

The DIVER trial has demonstrated that outpatient treatment may be safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and can reduce costs without negatively influencing the quality of life. The multicenter, RCT included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All patients underwent abdominal CT. The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department, and then, patients were either admitted to the hospital or discharged. Among a total of 132 patients, four patients in those admitted to hospital and three patients in those discharged to home management developed treatment failure (there were no differences between the groups (p = 0.62). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times less in the outpatient treated group, with significant costs savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

A systematic review including 21 studies (11 prospective, 9 retrospective, and only 1 randomized trial) with 1781 patients with ALCD managed in the outpatient setting was recently published. The meta-analysis concluded that outpatient management is safe, and the overall failure rate in an outpatient setting was 4.3% (95% CI 2.6–6.3%).

### Efficacy and safety of nonantibiotic outpatient treatment in mild acute diverticulitis (DINAMO-study): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, noninferiority trial [^4db5d0b9]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mild AD can be treated safely and effectively on an outpatient basis without antibiotics.

Summary Of Background Data

In recent years, it has shown no benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated AD in hospitalized patients. Also, outpatient treatment of uncomplicated AD has been shown to be safe and effective.

Methods

A Prospective, multicentre, open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial, in 15 hospitals of patients consulting the emergency department with symptoms compatible with AD. The Participants were patients with mild AD diagnosed by Computed Tomography meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to control arm (ATB-Group): classical treatment (875/125mg/8h amoxicillin/clavulanic acid apart from anti-inflammatory and symptomatic treatment) or experimental arm (Non-ATB-Group): experimental treatment (antiinflammatory and symptomatic treatment). Clinical controls were performed at 2, 7, 30, and 90days. The primary endpoint was hospital admission. Secondary endpoints included number of emergency department revisits, pain control and emergency surgery in the different arms.

Results

Four hundred and eighty patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to Non-ATB-Group (n = 242) or ATB-Group (n = 238). Hospitalization rates were: ATB-Group 14/238 (5.8%) and Non-ATB-Group 8/242 (3.3%) [mean difference 2.58%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.32 to -1.17], confirming noninferiority margin. Revisits: ATB-Group 16/238 (6.7%) and Non-ATB-Group 17/242 (7%) (mean difference -0.3, 95% CI 4.22 to -4.83). Poor pain control at 2days follow up: ATB-Group 13/230 (5.7%), Non-ATB-Group 5/221 (2.3%) (mean difference 3.39, 95% CI 6.96 to -0.18).

Conclusions

Nonantibiotic outpatient treatment of mild AD is safe and effective and is not inferior to current standard treatment.
