## Question

What is the role of corticosteroids in pertussis treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids have a role in treating pertussis and, if so, in which scenarios they might be appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity spectrum of pertussis. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for corticosteroids in mild-to-moderate disease, especially cough suppression. Next, I will examine data for severe disease, including ICU care and ARDS-like physiology. After that, I need to check for any special populations where steroids might be considered. Finally, I should weigh potential harms and synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation with clear guardrails for use or avoidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity spectrum. Pertussis ranges from mild cough in older children and adults to life-threatening disease in young infants, with the highest risk in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants under 2 months, who are prone to apnea, pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure; adolescents and adults drive transmission but generally have less severe disease, so any recommendation must be stratified by severity and age group [^115q3NkG] [^113zuU3V] [^116Zbrhy].

> Now, I should review the highest-quality evidence for corticosteroids in mild-to-moderate pertussis, particularly for cough suppression. Wait, let me verify the Cochrane conclusions and guideline positions. The Cochrane reviews consistently conclude there is insufficient evidence that corticosteroids reduce paroxysmal cough frequency or severity, and the CHEST pediatric cough guideline explicitly states dexamethasone provides no significant benefit for pertussis-associated cough, with one RCT even suggesting a non-significant increase in hospitalizations in wheezy children without asthma; taken together, routine corticosteroids for cough in pertussis are not recommended [^1153ojYo] [^1165sC9Y] [^115HyFYj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severe disease; I need to check whether steroids help in ICU-level pertussis with hypoxemic respiratory failure or ARDS-like physiology. Observational pediatric ICU cohorts show steroid use is common but not associated with improved outcomes; in fact, one study found higher steroid use in the mortality group, suggesting confounding by indication rather than benefit, and a separate ICU series advised against routine steroids and nitric oxide in severe infant pertussis, underscoring the lack of supportive evidence and potential harm signals [^113zuU3V] [^117R5LUZ].

> I should confirm whether ARDS frameworks change this. Contemporary ARDS guidance allows consideration of corticosteroids in established ARDS, but benefits are etiology-specific and timing-sensitive; extrapolation to pertussis-related ARDS is uncertain, and given the absence of RCTs in this population and potential harms, routine steroid use for pertussis-related ARDS remains unsupported outside trials, with any consideration requiring individualized risk–benefit assessment and close monitoring for adverse effects [^111q5Y1S] [^111U6Xw6].

> But wait, what if there are special populations where steroids might help. Let me consider two scenarios. First, patients with underlying asthma or COPD experiencing an exacerbation phenotype during pertussis may already be on inhaled corticosteroids, which should be continued for their chronic disease; however, this is not treatment for pertussis per se, and there is no evidence that adding systemic steroids for pertussis improves outcomes in this group, so escalation should be driven by asthma/COPD protocols rather than pertussis-specific indications [^112Ygi6T]. Second, case reports describe corticosteroids used for pertussis-triggered acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; these are isolated reports and do not establish a generalizable practice, so steroids here target the IPF exacerbation rather than pertussis pathobiology, and decisions should be individualized with pulmonology input [^111EmRoU] [^116hKawj].

> I need to ensure I weigh potential harms. Systemic corticosteroids carry risks of immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and secondary infections; in severe pertussis, where bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated infections are concerns, these risks may outweigh theoretical anti-inflammatory benefits, reinforcing a conservative stance in the absence of robust efficacy data [^111q5Y1S] [^114KDp8s].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the bottom line. For mild-to-moderate pertussis, corticosteroids should not be used for cough suppression given insufficient benefit and potential harm signals. For severe pertussis with respiratory failure or ARDS-like physiology, evidence is limited to observational data showing no clear benefit and possible harm; outside of a clinical trial, routine corticosteroids are not recommended, though an ARDS-informed, individualized approach may be considered in select cases with explicit risk–benefit documentation and close monitoring. Across scenarios, the priority remains early macrolide therapy to reduce transmission, supportive respiratory care, and ICU-level management of complications as indicated [^115HyFYj] [^1153ojYo] [^111q5Y1S] [^115JfKgH].

> Finally, I should confirm practical guidance. Do not prescribe corticosteroids for pertussis-related cough in children or adults; focus on timely macrolide treatment, supportive care, and escalation to ICU protocols for severe disease. If a patient with pertussis develops ARDS or a severe inflammatory phenotype, discuss a time-limited, closely monitored steroid trial only in exceptional circumstances and document the rationale; otherwise, avoid routine steroid use in pertussis [^115HyFYj] [^1153ojYo] [^111q5Y1S].

---

Corticosteroids are **not recommended** for routine pertussis management because high-quality evidence shows **no benefit** in reducing cough severity, duration, or complications [^1153ojYo] [^1165sC9Y]. They may be considered only in **severe cases** with critical illness, respiratory failure, or pulmonary hypertension, where anti-inflammatory effects could theoretically help, but data are limited and mixed [^117R5LUZ] [^113zuU3V]. Routine use is discouraged due to potential harms, including immunosuppression and secondary infections [^114KDp8s].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several clinical studies and systematic reviews have evaluated corticosteroids in pertussis, particularly for cough suppression and symptom relief:

- **Cochrane review (2014)**: Analyzed 12 trials (578 participants) and found no statistically significant benefit of corticosteroids in reducing cough frequency or severity, vomiting, cyanosis, or hospital stay. The authors concluded that evidence is insufficient to support corticosteroids for pertussis-related cough [^1153ojYo].

- **CHEST guideline (2020)**: States dexamethasone provides no significant benefit for symptomatic relief of pertussis-associated cough and may increase hospitalizations in wheezy children without asthma [^115HyFYj].

- **Earlier Cochrane review (2012)**: Similarly concluded that evidence is insufficient to support corticosteroids for pertussis-related cough [^1165sC9Y].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend routine corticosteroid use** in pertussis:

- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Recommends macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) as first-line treatment for pertussis; corticosteroids are not recommended for routine management.

- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Emphasizes antibiotic therapy and supportive care; corticosteroids are not recommended for routine pertussis management.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Corticosteroids carry **significant risks**, particularly in pediatric and immunocompromised populations:

- **Immunosuppression**: Increased risk of secondary infections, including bacterial and viral infections.

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, and adrenal suppression.

- **Growth suppression**: Particularly concerning in pediatric populations.

- **Neurological effects**: Mood changes, insomnia, and, rarely, psychiatric disturbances.

Given these risks and the lack of demonstrated benefit, routine corticosteroid use in pertussis is **not justified** [^111q5Y1S].

---

## Situations where corticosteroids may be considered

Although routine use is not recommended, corticosteroids may be considered in **specific severe cases**:

- **Severe respiratory compromise**: Patients with severe bronchospasm, respiratory distress, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like presentations may benefit from short-term corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation and improve oxygenation.

- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Some case series suggest corticosteroids may be beneficial in severe pediatric pertussis with pulmonary hypertension, though evidence is limited and mixed [^notfound].

- **Critical illness**: In ICU settings, corticosteroids may be considered as part of broader critical care management, but decisions should be individualized and based on clinical judgment.

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Corticosteroids have been compared with other symptomatic treatments, such as beta-agonists and antihistamines. Like corticosteroids, these treatments have **not demonstrated significant benefit** in reducing cough severity or duration in pertussis [^1153ojYo] [^1165sC9Y]. Antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of pertussis treatment, primarily to reduce transmission and bacterial load, though it has limited impact on cough duration once the paroxysmal stage begins [^115JfKgH].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

There is a need for **well-designed randomized controlled trials** to clarify the role of corticosteroids in pertussis, particularly in severe cases. Research should focus on identifying specific patient populations, optimal dosing regimens, and timing of administration. Additionally, studies should evaluate potential biomarkers or clinical predictors of corticosteroid responsiveness in pertussis.

---

Corticosteroids are **not recommended** for routine pertussis management due to a lack of evidence of benefit and potential risks. They may be considered in severe cases with respiratory compromise or pulmonary hypertension, but decisions should be individualized and based on clinical judgment.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1165sC9Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The worldwide incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) has been estimated at 48.5 million cases and nearly 295,000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may be as high as 4%. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta 2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 2, 2012), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE Issue 2, 2012) accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), AMED (1985 to January 2012), CINAHL (1980 to January 2012) and LILACS (January 2012). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated search in 2012. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay.

Main Results

Ten trials were included of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135) from high-income countries. Study quality was generally poor. Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials including a total of 196 participants reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 4.7 to 8.5. One study on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough.

Systemic corticosteroids in pediatric cough: We did not find any RCTs on use of oral steroids for non-specific cough in children. In cough associated with pertussis, dexamethasone provides no significant benefit for the symptomatic relief of cough, and in wheezy children without asthma, one RCT in 200 children (1–5 years) found that oral steroids conferred no benefit but were instead associated with a non-significant increase in hospitalizations (P = 0.058).

Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough. More high-quality trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of potential antitussive treatments in patients with whooping cough.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^113GyiAM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. There are 20 to 40 million cases of whooping cough annually world-wide, 90% of which occur in developing countries, resulting in an estimated 200 to 300 000 fatalities each year. Much of the morbidity is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Corticosteroids, salbutamol (beta 2 - adrenergic stimulant), and pertussis-specific immunoglobulin have been proposed as standard treatment for the cough. Antihistamines have also been administered. No systematic review of the effectiveness of any of these interventions or others has been performed.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions used to reduce the severity of the coughing paroxysms in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2003); EMBASE (1990 to June 2003) and LILACS (1982 to November 2001). We also scanned reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials and relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of any intervention aimed at suppressing the cough in whooping cough; excluding antibiotics and vaccines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Our primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis, development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Nine studies satisfied the inclusion criteria but four had insufficient data for meta - analysis of pre-specified outcomes. Studies were small and poorly reported. The largest study had a sample size of 49 and the smallest study 18. All studies were performed in industrialised settings. Eligible studies assessed diphenhyramine, pertussis immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and salbutamol. No statistically significant benefit was found for any of the interventions. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing spells (mean increase of coughing spells per 24 hours 1.9 with 95%CI - 4.7 to 8.5) and pertussis immunoglobulin no change in hospital stay (0.7 days 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4), and a mean reduction of 3.1 whoops per 24 hours [95% CI -6.2; 0.02]. Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in hospital stay (-3.5 days 95% CI - 15.3 to 8.4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours [-0.22 95% CI - 4.13 to 3.69].

Reviewer's Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions about the effects of any intervention for the cough in whooping cough.

Severe and mild-to-moderate illness — evidence base and study limitations: the search identified one RCT, one "partially" randomized trial, one prospective cohort, and five retrospective cohort studies, with the RCT providing the best available evidence on corticosteroid treatment; non-randomized studies had significant limitations and concerns for risk of bias due to lack of adjustment for critical confounders or potential residual confounding, and timing, dose, and duration of corticosteroids varied across studies.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of exchange transfusion in infants with severe pertussis [^117R5LUZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to ET, all severe pertussis patients received comprehensive treatment, such as antibiotic therapy, mechanical ventilation, treatment for pulmonary hypertension, ECMO, immunoglobulin and hormone therapy, etc. Severe pertussis often leads to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation intervention. Currently, there is no unified indication for mechanical ventilation. The treatment of pulmonary hypertension mainly uses inhaled NO, prostacyclin pathway agonists, etc. The overall survival rate of ECMO treatment is still low, and there is no consensus on the best time to start ECMO treatment for severe pertussis. Glucocorticoid can alleviate symptoms to a certain extent, but their survival benefits for severe pertussis are still controversial. A study by Hon et al. found that the proportion of hormone use in the mortality group was significantly higher than that in the surviving group. In this study, the use rate of glucocorticoid, treatment for pulmonary hypertension and vasoactive drugs in the mortality group was higher than that in the surviving group, while there was no difference in other treatments such as mechanical ventilation, immunoglobulin and ECMO. This suggested that when general treatment for severe pertussis is ineffective and glucocorticoid, pulmonary hypertension drugs and vasoactive drugs are needed, the prognosis of the child may be poor.

Our study has some limitations based on survey data. This study is a single-center, retrospective study with a relatively small number of cases in the mortality group, making it impossible to conduct a Logistic regression analysis of risk factors. In the future, we will strive to conduct multi-center, large-sample, prospective studies, which will have more clinical significance.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^116Zbrhy]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

### An observational study of severe pertussis in 100 infants ≤ 120 days of age [^113zuU3V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis in young infants is a unique, severe, afebrile, cough illness that is frequently fatal.

Methods

All pertussis cases ≤ 120 days of age admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in California between October 1, 2013, and April 25, 2015, were evaluated.

Results

Of 100 pertussis patients ≤ 120 days of age admitted to pediatric intensive care unit, there were 5 deaths. The white blood cell counts in the fatal cases were significantly higher than in the nonfatal cases. Thirty-four percent of patients were intubated, 18% received inotropic and/or vasoactive support, 22% received steroid, 4% received extracorporal membrane oxygenation, and 3% underwent exchange blood transfusion. The median age at the time of illness onset in the patients who died was 23 days.

Conclusions

These data, as well as data from previous California studies, suggest updated strategies for the management of severe pertussis. These include perform serial white blood cell counts, treat all presumptive cases with azithromycin, evaluate for pulmonary hypertension, intubate and administer oxygen for apneic episodes and administer inotropic/vasoactive agents for cardiogenic shock. Do not administer steroids or nitric oxide. Criteria for exchange blood transfusion therapy for leukocytosis with lymphocytosis are suggested.

### Analysis of multiple factors involved in pertussis-like coughing [^116Ktr5t]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives. To identify risk factors associated with the prognosis of pertussis-like coughing. Methods. A retrospective study on children hospitalized with pertussis-like coughing from 2018 to 2019. We collected all the case data from medical records including age, gender, vaccination, clinical symptoms, complication, pathogens, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte ratio, application of macrolide antibiotics, usage of sulfamethoxazole, and usage of inhaled glucocorticoids. Logistic regression was used in this study. Results. A total of 213 hospitalized children with pertussis-like coughing were included in this study. About 70 children were cured within 2 weeks. One120 children were cured from 2 weeks to 3 months, including cases of initial attack and relapse. Symptoms lasting longer than 3 months accounts for 10.8%. Bordetella pertussis, WBC count > 20 × 10 9 /L and lymphocyte ratio > 60% were associated with poor prognosis (P < .05). Conclusions. Bordetella pertussis, WBC count, and lymphocyte ratio are independent risk factors for poor prognosis.

### Population-based study of pertussis incidence and risk factors among persons > 50 years of age, Australia [^112Ygi6T]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk for pertussis diagnosis in patients with underlying COPD and asthma was previously reported to be higher than for patients with pertussis but without those conditions. Contemporary data also suggest that patients with COPD and asthma have a higher pertussis incidence, risk for pertussis infection, and greater subsequent disease burden than patients with pertussis but without such concurrent conditions (,–). Furthermore, asthma, COPD, and other chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases can be exacerbated by B. pertussis infection. Increased risk for pertussis in patients with COPD or asthma may be explained by potential adverse effects of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, altered airway architecture, impairment of innate and acquired immunity, waning humoral immunity over time, and influence of concurrent conditions on immunogenicity.

In this study, women, older age groups, and those with a history of influenza vaccination were associated with a higher median number of GP visits in a year, likely resulting in a higher chance of pertussis being recognized or diagnosed. Those observations might be due to women and older adults (who may have other concurrent conditions) visiting the GP more often. The higher median number of GP visits in persons with a history of influenza vaccination versus without suggests that those persons are more health conscious (i.e. healthy vaccinee bias) or had other conditions that required more GP visits. Among all patients diagnosed with pertussis, antibiotic prescriptions within 1 month before pertussis diagnosis were more common for those with COPD or asthma, men, and younger age groups (50–74 years); macrolides and penicillin were the most prescribed. Of note, persistent cough is a criterion for asthma and COPD exacerbation according to Australia guidelines, possibly explaining why antibiotics were more commonly prescribed and why pertussis may not have been recognized or diagnosed earlier in these patients. Because macrolides are the preferred treatment for pertussis, an adequate dosage and treatment duration may reduce likelihood of pertussis diagnosis, which may have skewed the estimated pertussis IRs in the populations described in this study, particularly among patients with COPD or asthma.

### What's old is new again: pertussis [^116Ld8xd]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of a vaccine, pertussis is a particularly difficult disease to control. Improvements in molecular diagnosis, changes in vaccine components, and missed opportunities for vaccination have resulted in rising pertussis disease incidence. Young infants are at the highest risk of severe complications and mortality, but immunization of mothers during pregnancy can provide protection. The presentation of infant pertussis differs somewhat from the traditional catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages seen in adults. By understanding the clinical presentation of pertussis in all age groups, providers can more quickly prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy and postexposure prophylaxis. Providers are also an essential source of evidence-based vaccination counseling for pregnant women and families, and understanding the complications of this disease is an important part of these sometimes difficult but critical conversations.

### Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis induced by pertussis: the first case report [^111EmRoU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is a severe condition with limited treatment strategies. Although respiratory infection is a major cause of AE-IPF, no reports have indicated pertussis infection as a cause. Here we report two cases of pertussis infection-induced AE-IPF.

Case Presentation

Both patients presented with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress and were previously diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Neither patient had received any pertussis vaccination since adolescence. Both patients were diagnosed with AE-IPF accompanying acute pertussis infection based on chest computed tomography and serum pertussis toxin antibody > 100 EU/mL. Both patients were treated with macrolide antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids. Both patients were able to be discharged and return home.

Conclusions

The presence of pertussis infection in AE-IPF can present a diagnostic challenge, as coughing accompanying pertussis may be difficult to distinguish from IPF-associated coughing. Pertussis infection should be assayed in AE-IPF patients. Since pertussis can be prevented with vaccination and is expected to be affected by antibiotics, consideration of pertussis infection as a causative virulent factor of AE-IPF may be important for management of subjects with IPF.

### Steroid-responsive chronic cerebellitis with positive glutamate receptor delta 2 antibody [^112ZKVnG]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

We report the clinical course of a 4-year-old girl with chronic cerebellitis (onset 2 days after diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination at 1 year and 7 months old) associated with anti-glutamate receptor delta 2 antibody, who improved dramatically with steroid therapy (methylprednisolone pulse therapy plus oral prednisolone). Recently, it has been reported that the anti-glutamate receptor delta 2 selectively expressed at the post-synaptic site of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses has an important role in cerebellar function in the developing brain. The present case suggests that anti-glutamate receptor delta 2 antibody plays a primary role in an immune-mediated process causing chronic cerebellar symptoms, and the lesion site seems to be localized to the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse. Because the cerebellum is strongly involved in language acquisition as well as motor development, treatment must facilitate time for language learning while reducing the side effects of the corticosteroid therapy.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JfKgH]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis laboratory diagnosis and treatment context: There are several recognized laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis; culture (100% specific), polymerase chain reaction (88%-100% specific), serology (72%-100% specific), and oral fluid testing (91%-99% specific). There are several effective antibiotics; these eliminate B pertussis but do not alter the clinical course of the illness. However, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of illness to prevent spread of the disease. The decision to treat with antibiotics is therefore frequently based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.

### MASP1 modulation as a novel therapeutic target in severe pediatric pertussis: insights from a multi-omics approach [^113oW9S7]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the role of the MASP1 protein in severe pertussis in children through multi-omics analysis, with the aim of providing a theoretical basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. Initially, the study identified significant differences in the nasal-pharyngeal microbial diversity and specific bacterial abundance between the healthy pediatric control group and pertussis pediatric patient group, laying the foundation for further exploration of the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of pertussis. Subsequently, through protein–protein interaction network analysis and machine learning algorithms, the study screened and validated the expression changes of the characteristic pertussis gene MASP1, revealing its crucial role in the process of pertussis infection. In vitro experiments and in vivo animal model experiments further confirmed that inhibiting MASP1 expression can significantly alleviate pertussis infection symptoms. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of pertussis but also provide important scientific evidence for the future development of precision treatment strategies targeting MASP1 in clinical practice. In summary, this study holds significant scientific significance and potential application value in the pathological research and clinical treatment of pertussis.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^117R1TCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the absence of systematic vaccination with pertussis vaccine, essentially every person will suffer whooping cough during infancy or childhood; many will suffer serious sequelae or die. No medical intervention is risk-free, but modern pertussis vaccines are both effective and safe — indeed, vastly safer than avoiding vaccination. Pertussis is an endemic and highly contagious disease; outbreaks will continue to occur. In an outbreak, vaccinated children are less likely to be infected; if infected, illness will be less severe [51–53, 332]. Unvaccinated children are at much higher risk of infection and, if infected, at much higher risk of adverse outcome. A number of approaches to new vaccines with more durable protection are under investigation.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

Using data extraction forms designed specifically for this review, MF extracted information on study design, participants, interventions or exposures, and outcomes measured. JS double-checked the accuracy of data extraction. Two authors (MF, JS) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies as appropriate. We assessed each domain of bias (e.g. sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome, selective reporting for RCTs) and assigned it one of the following three judgments: low risk of bias (plausible bias that was unlikely to seriously alter the results), high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakened confidence in the results), or unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that could have raised some doubt about the results) when there was insufficient information to make a judgment. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assign the overall quality of evidence for each outcome to one of four levels – high, moderate, low, or very low – according to factors including within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias.

Neither patient had received any pertussis vaccination since adolescence. As both exhibited a typical usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution CT, they were both clinically diagnosed with IPF. No blood test exams or physical findings showed any sign of autoimmune disease. Both patients reported a chronic cough associated with the IPF, but they had been aware of uncontrolled cough deterioration and continuous cough beginning approximately 3 weeks before hospitalization. Neither patient had Bordetella pertussis detected from sputum; moreover, PCR analysis was not performed, so the patients did not directly show presence of pathogen. Although the typical symptoms of pertussis (e.g. inspiratory whoop) were not observed in either patient, no infectious diseases other than pertussis were detected through sputum culture tests or serum markers. No other causative bacteria were detected in urine antigen tests or sputum culture tests. Moreover, heart failure was not observed in either patient. Both patients were treated with macrolides and broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, accompanied by high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Case 1 involved an initial acute exacerbation and Case 2 involved a recurrent acute exacerbation.

### Population-based study of pertussis incidence and risk factors among persons > 50 years of age, Australia [^1133XJRv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

When stratified by sex, pertussis IRs among women were 110.5 (95% CI 102.3–118.7) in 2015 and 74.5 (95% CI 66.3–82.7) in 2019. Lower IRs of 70.6 (95% CI 64.3–76.8) in 2015 and 41.6 (95% CI 35.4–47.8) in 2019 were observed among men (Figure 2, panel C). Similar trends were reported by the NNDSS, although pertussis IRs were lower than those in our study population (Figure 2).

In patients with COPD, pertussis IRs throughout the study period ranged from 304.4 (95% CI 290.7–318.1) in 2015 to 194.3 (95% CI 180.5–207.9) in 2019 (Figure 3, panel A; Appendix Table 6). Similarly, in patients with asthma, pertussis IRs ranged from 473.0 (95% CI 454.0–492.0) in 2015 to 376.8 (95% CI 357.8–395.8) in 2019 (Figure 4, panel A; Appendix Table 7). Although pertussis IRs among patients with COPD or asthma were higher than the overall study population, variations between age groups were generally consistent (Figure 3, panel B; Figure 4, panel B). Consistent with the overall study population, pertussis IRs in women with COPD or asthma were higher than in men with COPD (Figure 3, panel C; Appendix Table 6) or in men with asthma (Figure 4, panel C; Appendix Table 7).

### Pertussis: an old disease that is still with us [^113wjLtw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of pathogenesis, clinical presentation and prevention of pertussis has improved substantially over recent years. We now better understand the function of long-known virulence factors for Bordetella pertussis, and genome sequencing has identified a multitude of new proteins; their functions are yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, improved diagnostic tools have revealed the broad spectrum of disease, and new insights into the host's immune response have been gained. Finally, the development, evaluation, licensing and implementation of several new acellular pertussis vaccines with high acceptance have changed the epidemiology of pertussis in many countries (i.e. a shift towards an increasing burden of disease in adolescent persons and adults). These developments are likely to have great impact on the daily practice not only of paediatricians, but also of general practitioners, internists, gynaecologists and many other specialists in adolescent and adult medicine. The present review provides an update on recent progress.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^111eT4Xm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory disease that continues to infect individuals and cause deaths despite available vaccines. While there have been increases in case numbers every 2–5 years, 2024 proved to be a significant year in terms of both incidence and deaths from pertussis. Preliminary CDC data from 2025 shows a continuation of this trend with 8,472 pertussis cases through April — twice as many as the same time period in 2024. Given the high risk of severe disease and death among young infants and in un‐ or under‐vaccinated individuals, vaccination is a prevention strategy that remains a mainstay in protecting the most vulnerable.

### MASP1 modulation as a novel therapeutic target in severe pediatric pertussis: insights from a multi-omics approach [^116FUAbQ]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

This study investigated the role of MASP1 in pertussis infection using the human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE135-E6E7 in vitro. By manipulating MASP1 expression levels through overexpression and knockdown, the study confirmed MASP1's function in pertussis infection. The results demonstrated that MASP1 overexpression exacerbated pertussis-induced cell damage, adding to the understanding of MASP1's involvement in cellular inflammatory responses from previous studies. While MASP1 has traditionally been recognized as an immune response regulator, this research further established its direct role in airway epithelial cell injury. This deepened insight into MASP1's cellular actions not only paves the way for potential cell protection strategies but also sheds light on our comprehension of its function at the cellular level.

Using a mouse model of pertussis infection, this study evaluated the impact of inhibiting MASP1 expression on infection symptoms. The findings revealed that MASP1 inhibition significantly alleviated symptoms caused by pertussis bacteria, reducing bacterial burden and tissue damage in the lungs and airways. This aligns with prior research on MASP1's role in inflammatory responses and, for the first time in an animal model, validates the potential of MASP1 as a therapeutic target. These discoveries suggest that through targeted MASP1 regulation, the severity of pertussis infection can be effectively controlled, offering new avenues for future clinical treatments.

This study reveals that children with pertussis exhibit significantly decreased nasal and pharyngeal microbial diversity compared with healthy children, with an increase in the abundance of specific pathogenic bacterial groups. This finding aligns with previous research on the impact of infectious diseases on microbial diversity. However, utilizing more refined metagenomic data, this study further elucidates specific changes in bacterial communities and their association with disease severity. For instance, an increase in the abundance of specific bacterial groups, such as B. pertussis, correlates positively with disease severity. Clinical treatment guidelines indicate that macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) have consistently been effective and are among the primary treatment options for pertussis patients. Short-term antibiotic treatments (azithromycin for 3 to 5 days or clarithromycin or erythromycin for 7 days) are as effective as long-term erythromycin treatment (10 to 14 days) in eradicating B. pertussis from the nasopharynx. Therefore, routine antibiotic treatment may be one of the key factors contributing to the greater diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota in children with pertussis. Consequently, the aforementioned bioinformatic investigation offers new insights for future microbiota-targeted intervention strategies, suggesting that modulating microbiota composition could provide an avenue for early-stage intervention in the progression of pertussis.

### Use of antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of pertussis [^111k9XHz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are commonly used for treating confirmed cases of pertussis and also for disease prevention in outbreak situations, and there is little evidence of antibiotic resistance of Bordetella pertussis. The most commonly used antibiotic is erythromycin, but the associated side effects limit compliance and therefore efficacy. Other antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, have been shown to be at least as effective as erythromycin in preventing and treating pertussis, and they also have fewer side effects, which improves compliance. This article outlines the use of different antibiotics in pertussis management and their effect on preventing disease transmission and reducing disease severity and duration.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^1119Uc9M]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a contagious, respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, a fastidious gram‐negative coccobacillus. The infection is spread from person to person by exposure to large respiratory droplets released in the air by coughing or sneezing. The incubation period is generally 7–10 days, but infection can occur up to 21 days after exposure. Pertussis is more prominent in the fall and winter months, though in contrast to common respiratory viruses, there is no true seasonality. Pertussis can cause a disruptive, sometimes debilitating, cough in adults, though hospitalization is exceedingly rare. Infants, in contrast, are at high risk for developing severe disease, leading to hospitalization and death. The widespread use of vaccination has led to a significant decrease in disease incidence. However, due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity, pertussis incidence has begun to rise again. This clinical progress note reviews the epidemiology, clinical course, management, and complications of pertussis.

### Antibiotic treatment of pertussis: are 7 days really sufficient? [^11766cTS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Short courses of antibiotic therapy are recommended for treatment of pertussis. We report 2 young unvaccinated infants with persistently positive Bordetella pertussis by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs despite 7 days of clarithromycin (15mg/kg/d) therapy. In 1 patient, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 7.02 (log GEq/mL) at the onset of treatment, 6.26 at the end of treatment and remained positive with 2.64 and 2.69 during and after a second 7-day course, respectively. The generally believed assumption that contagiousness of pertussis is terminated after 5 days of antibiotic treatment should be challenged, at least in young infants.

### Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonism reduces Bordetella pertussis-mediated lung pathology [^115vAq25]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Recent pertussis resurgence represents a major public health concern. Currently, there are no effective treatments for critical pertussis in infants. Recent data have demonstrated the potential of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonism in the treatment of infectious diseases. We used the murine Bordetella pertussis model to test the hypothesis that treatment with S1PR agonist AAL-R reduces pulmonary inflammation during infection. AAL-R treatment resulted in reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and attenuated lung pathology in infected mice. These results demonstrate a role for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in B. pertussis-mediated pathology and highlight the possibility of host-targeted therapy for pertussis.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

The significant burden of disease due to pertussis, which predominantly affects newborns during their first few months of life, was substantially decreased following the introduction of inactivated whole-bacterial-cell vaccines in the middle of the 20th century. Although these vaccines were effective in reducing the incidence of pertussis in the countries that implemented their widespread use, increasing concerns about pertussis vaccine-associated adverse events led the development of acellular pertussis vaccines containing 1 or more purified Bordetella pertussis proteins. During the 1990s, collaborative international clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and/or efficacy of different acellular vaccines.

Pediatric chronic cough — empirical therapy use and bias notes that the majority of children in all the studies received treatment specific for the underlying cause rather than an empirical approach; in some situations, an empirical trial is required, such as using inhaled corticosteroids when the cough is dry and objective testing cannot be undertaken in a young child. Ascribing causes for the cough has an inherent high risk of bias related to the placebo and period effects, and these risks of bias can be reduced by limiting the time frame in which response to treatment is considered when a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not undertaken.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has recently re-emerged as a major public health threat despite high levels of vaccination against the aetiological agent Bordetella pertussis. In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis of this disease, with a focus on recent mechanistic insights into B. pertussis virulence-factor function. We also discuss the changing epidemiology of pertussis and the challenges facing vaccine development. Despite decades of research, many aspects of B. pertussis physiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood. We highlight knowledge gaps that must be addressed to develop improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115cJWn5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Vaccinations in asthma — The risk of influenza infection itself can be reduced by annual vaccination. A 2013 systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials of influenza vaccination showed no reduction in asthma exacerbations, whereas a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations but bias could not be excluded for most of the studies; there is no evidence for an increase in asthma exacerbations after influenza vaccination compared with placebo. In individuals aged 2–49 years with mild–moderate asthma, a systematic review found no significant safety concerns or increased risk for asthma-related outcomes after influenza vaccination with live attenuated virus. RSV vaccines prevent RSV-related acute respiratory infection; an adjuvanted RSV-subunit vaccine reduced upper and lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years or older, including in those with underlying coexisting conditions such as asthma. Pneumococcal vaccine protects against invasive pneumococcal infection, but asthma alone is not a specific indication for pneumococcal vaccination; pertussis vaccination reduces the risk of severe pertussis-related disease, but there is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in preventing asthma exacerbations in adults. Advise patients with moderate to severe asthma to receive an influenza vaccination every year, or at least when vaccination of the general population is advised (Evidence C), encourage children, adults and the elderly with asthma to follow their local immunization schedule including pneumococcal, pertussis, influenza, RSV and COVID-19 vaccinations, and COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination may be given on the same day.

### Pertussis: a disease affecting all ages [^115okZhR]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis is a highly contagious bacterium known to cause pertussis (whooping cough) and is transmitted via airborne droplets. Although childhood vaccination has dramatically reduced reported pertussis cases, the incidence of the disease has increased over the past 20 years, most notably in previously immunized adolescents and adults. Pertussis should be suspected in patients of all ages with cough who meet the clinical criteria for the disease. Diagnostic tests currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for pertussis infection have low sensitivity. Regardless of test results, physicians should treat clinically suspected pertussis with antimicrobials and report cases to their state health department. A 14-day erythromycin regimen has been the treatment of choice; however, shorter-course macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) may be as effective with fewer adverse effects and better adherence to therapy. The recently recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for adolescents and adults may decrease the incidence of pertussis in infants — the group at the greatest risk of pertussis complications.

### Pertussis: a reemerging infection [^115q3NkG]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory tract infection that has increased in incidence in recent years. The initial catarrhal stage presents with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, rhinorrhea, sneezing, lacrimation, and mild cough. During the paroxysmal stage, severe outbreaks of coughing often lead to the classic high-pitched whooping sound patients make when gasping for breath. The paroxysmal stage is followed by the convalescent stage and resolution of symptoms. Complications vary by age, with infants more likely to experience severe complications such as apnea, pneumonia, seizures, or death. In adolescents and adults, complications are the result of chronic cough. The diagnosis depends on clinical signs and laboratory testing. Both culture and polymerase chain reaction testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis; serologic testing is not standardized or routinely recommended. Although antibiotics have not shown clear effectiveness in the treatment of pertussis, they eradicate nasal bacterial carriage and may reduce transmission rates. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin are first-line treatments to prevent transmission; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an alternative in cases of allergy or intolerance to macrolides. Immunization against pertussis is essential for disease prevention. Current recommendations in the United States consist of administering five doses of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine to children before seven years of age, and administering a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster between 11 and 18 years of age. Recent efforts have focused on the vaccination of adolescents and adults, with new recommendations for a single dose of the Tdap booster if it has not been previously administered.

### Role of corticosteroids in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111FPmtn]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence supporting or refuting the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has only recently become available, and evidence is still missing for a number of important clinical issues. Results from four large studies on the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on COPD and other controlled studies on the more short-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids provide evidence that regular treatment with these drugs is only appropriate for a limited group of patients with COPD. These include symptomatic COPD patients with documented spirometric response to inhaled corticosteroids or those with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) less than 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations requiring treatments with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids.

HOW DO ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTICS IMPACT CLINICAL PRACTICE?

In persons with pertussis, the median time from cough onset to seeking medical care differs by age group. For example, in 1 study setting, children aged 7–12 years were seen after 7.8 days of coughing, whereas adolescents aged 13–18 years were seen after 12.5 days and adults 17.3 days after symptoms began [and Riffelmann M, et al. unpublished data]. The interval from the onset of cough to when the patient seeks medical care has a major effect on the laboratory diagnosis of B. pertussis infection. Culture obtained during the first 3 weeks of cough has 100% specificity, but low sensitivity, ranging from 20% to 80%, when compared with PCR and/or serology. In general, culture and PCR sensitivity is inversely related to age. Other factors that may influence the sensitivity of culture are the type and quality of specimen, the type of transport media, and the duration of transport (optimally within 48 hours).

### Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis induced by pertussis: the first case report [^116hKawj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The current report described cases that demonstrated infection with pertussis as a cause of AE-IPF. Infection is now considered to be a major causative factor leading to AE-IPF. While various bacteria and viruses have been studied as potential causes of AE-IPF, to the best of our knowledge, the cases presented herein constitute the first report in the literature of pertussis as the causative agent of AE-IPF.

The current case report revealed three major findings. The first finding was that consideration of pertussis infection should be noted as part of the differential diagnosis during AE-IPF. Many physicians mistakenly consider pertussis to solely present as a pediatric infection; however, recent publications have shown that pertussis is now common among adults and is often overlooked by internists. Additionally, many adult cases of pertussis do not exhibit typical symptoms and IPF patients often already exhibit persistent dry cough; thus, some physicians may be less likely to initially consider pertussis during the differential diagnosis. These factors may have led to pertussis frequently being overlooked as a potential causative pathogen in cases of AE-IPF.

The second finding was the anticipated efficacy of treatment with macrolide antibiotics. Although further discussion may be necessary, macrolide antibiotic treatment can sometimes reduce the duration or severity of symptoms in pertussis infection. When a patient exhibits AE-IPF, we do not routinely prescribe macrolide antibiotics that are known to be useful for whooping cough. Therefore, our clinical experience may influence antibiotic selection in cases of AE-IPF, because AE-IPF in the current patient may be due to pertussis infection.

Lastly, most bacterial infections of the respiratory tract are not preventable; however, pertussis is one of the few pathogens that is preventable through vaccination. Pertussis vaccination is now recommended in a wide array of developed countries. Vaccination is anticipated to be particularly effective in countries where pertussis vaccinations are not performed after adolescence, as in Japan.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^113NdPkM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The case definitions of pertussis delineated here should first be tested in clinical trials to determine their utility to the average clinician and then be compared with existing case definitions to determine whether they confer increased sensitivity and/or specificity. Although retrospective analyses are subject to bias, such analyses could be performed first in a "proof-of-principle" approach. If the new case definitions appear promising, a prospective study should be conducted to evaluate the proposed diagnostic criteria in the 3 different age categories (0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, ≥ 10 years).

The protocol we propose would involve the prospective evaluation of all persons in a defined population with cough illnesses of ≥ 7 days' duration stratified into the 3 different age categories. The study populations should include geographic regions with different vaccine usage patterns (acellular, whole-cell, or both). Protocols could be adopted from the Adult Pertussis Trial (APERT) and the vaccine efficacy trial in Erlangen, Germany. In both of these studies, investigators contacted participants every 2 weeks, and all subjects with cough illness of ≥ 7 days that was not improving were evaluated. Intensive education programs will be necessary to prevent observer bias. Studies should be of such duration that they cover the cyclical epidemiologic patterns of pertussis and include populations of sufficient size to allow statistical analysis.

The development and utilization of 3 age-related definitions for pertussis can be expected to increase both the sensitivity and specificity in its diagnosis, which will result in the recognition of pertussis in all age groups, potentially leading to better control of pertussis.

### Pertussis: review of epidemiology, diagnosis, management and prevention [^111neyS8]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis — the cause of pertussis or whooping cough — is an exclusively human pathogen. Disease elimination by vaccination should, therefore, be possible, but has proved elusive. Many industrialised countries with long established immunisation programs are currently seeing a resurgence of pertussis, despite universal vaccination with high uptake, with the highest burden in the least immunised age groups (infants under 6 months of age and persons over 10 years old). However, low recognition and reporting and insensitive diagnostic tests mean that the true burden of pertussis is still underestimated. Recently, efforts to improve diagnostic yield include the expanded use of polymerase chain reaction and serological tests but both have significant limitations. The range of antibiotics available for treatment and prophylaxis has expanded to include the newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and a range of universal and targeted vaccination strategies have been implemented or proposed. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of pertussis in developed countries, including modes of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and potential vaccination strategies.

### Pharmacological treatments in ARDS; a state-of-the-art update [^1113XDYb]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

Given their effective anti-inflammatory properties, there has been extensive interest in the potential role of corticosteroids in both the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Different regimens have been investigated, varying from short courses of high-dose steroids to prolonged courses of lower doses.

High dose corticosteroids do not prevent ARDS in at risk subjects. Therapeutically, both high-dose and moderate-dose steroids have so far failed to demonstrate efficacy in ARDS. An ARDSnet randomized, double-blind trial in 180 patients with ARDS for more than seven days, showed no effect of prolonged treatment with moderate-dose methylprednisolone compared to placebo (Table 1). Although patients were liberated from mechanical ventilation earlier, patients receiving methylprednisolone were more likely to resume assisted ventilation, which was thought to be secondary to neuromuscular effects. In addition, initiation of treatment after 14 days of ARDS was associated with a harmful effect, with increased mortality at 60 and 180 days.

However, the role of low-dose corticosteroids in established ARDS remains uncertain, with one study of 91 patients demonstrating prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone therapy reduces severity of lung injury by Day 7 of treatment (Table 1).

Despite a systematic review and meta-analysis, the role of steroids in ARDS remains unclear, and in light of ongoing uncertainty, further trials are both planned (NCT01731795) and on-going (NCT01284452) (Table 2). It is also worth highlighting that the studies included used what are now considered injurious ventilation strategies. It remains uncertain if steroids provide benefit when combined with lung protective (and, therefore, less inflammatory) ventilator strategies.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^112enVt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### A role for genomics-based studies of Bordetella pertussis adaptation [^114zueUf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

However, as with most attempts to define drivers of pertussis disease patterns, multiple independent factors are at play. China has moved to the use of ACVs more recently than other countries. As noted above, the use of ACVs gives rise to dominance of ptxP3 strains and increased infection of noninfant age groups. Thus, the reported change in epidemiology in China might be expected regardless of whether MLVA 28 was circulating or not. The focus was the 2 years immediately postpandemic, and as discussed above, an immunity debt may allow any strain that enters this population to expand rapidly, rather than this being due to a seemingly hyper-infectious clone.

Also, the impact of macrolide resistance in B. pertussis on treatment and bacterial fitness is enigmatic as the exact role of macrolides in treating pertussis is unclear. Multiple studies report that it shortens duration of cough, but only if administered soon after cough onset, within 2 weeks at the latest, for example. Azithromycin treatment cleared B. pertussis from the nasopharynx of experimentally infected, but asymptomatic, participants in a human challenge model. Cumulatively, evidence is suggestive of macrolide treatment clearing B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and helping to shorten the period of symptoms. However, this would indicate B. pertussis is exposed to macrolides in vivo and thus is subjected to selective pressure by them; and yet macrolides have been administered to pertussis patients for decades in many countries, but resistance is almost entirely restricted to China where it has increased in incidence only recently. The absence of resistance elsewhere suggests treatment per se does not impose a strong selection for resistance, at least not prior to transmission. If resistance remains restricted to China, it suggests selection pressure is coming from other exposures to macrolides. An increase in resistance in other regions would be suggestive of the bacterium receiving selection pressure for resistance in those receiving treatment prior to transmission and indicate a change in B. pertussis infection dynamics. Thus, while widespread resistance in a region is a recent phenomenon and the longer term consequences of resistance on B. pertussis biology is unknown, surveillance of this issue is important while this uncertainty exists.

Given during pregnancy — pertussis (Tdap) vaccination: People who are pregnant should receive the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine during each pregnancy to provide passive immunity to infants, who would not otherwise routinely receive it until 2 months of age. Although a pregnant person can receive the Tdap vaccine at any time during pregnancy, the optimal time to receive the vaccine is from 27–36 weeks' gestation, maximizing maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the newborn. People who do not receive the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy should receive it in the immediate postpartum period if they had never received a prior dose, whereas people who did not receive the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy but had received a prior dose of Tdap in their lifetime should not receive Tdap postpartum. Pertussis poses a significant burden on infants and can be very serious or deadly, especially in those younger than 1 year, and pertussis-related hospitalizations and deaths are highest in infants younger than 2 months.

### Pertussis vaccines and protective immunity [^111YRQad]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite high vaccine coverage, reported cases of pertussis have increased steadily over the last twenty years. This resurgence has stimulated interest in host responses to pertussis infection and vaccination with the goal of developing more effective next-generation vaccines and vaccination strategies. Optimal protection against Bordetella pertussis appears to be multifactorial requiring both humoral and cellular responses. Natural infection and whole-cell pertussis vaccination induce Th1 and Th17-dominated responses. In contrast, acellular vaccines induce Th2-dominated responses. Available immunological data indicate that while antibodies provide protection against disease, Th1 and Th17-mediated immune responses are required for bacterial clearance and long-lasting protection. The nature of the priming in children appears to be important in modulating bias and durability of immune responses required to provide protection against B. pertussis. This review summarizes the current understanding of differences in immune responses and their role in protection against B. pertussis following infection or vaccination.

### Whole-cell pertussis vaccine in early infancy for the prevention of allergy in children [^116jGBy7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic diseases are the most common chronic conditions of childhood. The apparent rise in food anaphylaxis in young children over the past three decades is of particular concern, owing to the lack of proven prevention strategies other than the timely introduction of peanut and egg. Due to reported in vitro differences in the immune response of young infants primed with whole-cell pertussis (wP) versus acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine, we systematically appraised and synthesised evidence on the safety and the potential allergy preventive benefits of wP, to inform recommendation for future practice and research.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of wP vaccinations in comparison to aP vaccinations in early infancy for the prevention of atopic diseases in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and grey literature. The date of the search was 7 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) that reported the occurrence of atopic diseases, and RCTs only to assess safety outcomes. To be included studies had to have at least six months follow-up, and involve children under 18 years old, who received a first dose of either wP (experimental intervention) or aP (comparator) before six months of age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy and all-cause serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included: diagnosis of not vaccine-associated anaphylaxis or urticaria, diagnosis of asthma, diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and diagnosis of encephalopathy. Due to paucity of RCTs reporting on the atopic outcomes of interest, we assessed a broader outcome domain (cumulative incidence of atopic disease) as specified in our protocol. We summarised effect estimates as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled safety data in meta-analyses using fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel methods, without zero-cell corrections for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified four eligible studies reporting on atopic outcomes, representing 7333 children. Based on a single trial, there was uncertain evidence on whether wP vaccines affected the risk of overall atopic disease (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17) or asthma only (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.82; 497 children) by 2.5 years old. Three NRSIs were judged to be at serious or critical risk of bias due to confounding, missing data, or both, and were ineligible for inclusion in a narrative synthesis. We identified 21 eligible studies (137,281 children) that reported the safety outcomes of interest. We judged seven studies to be at high risk of bias and those remaining, at unclear risk. The pooled RR was 0.94 for all-cause SAEs (95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 38,072 children). For every 1000 children primed with a first dose of wP, 11 had an SAE. The corresponding risk with aP was 12 children (95% CI 9 to 13). The 95% CI around the risk difference ranged from three fewer to two more events per 1000 children, and the certainty of the evidence was judged as moderate (downgraded one level for imprecision). No diagnoses of encephalopathy following vaccination were reported (95% CI around the risk difference - 5 to 12 per 100,000 children; seven primary series studies; 115,271 children). The certainty of the evidence was judged as low, since this is a serious condition, and we could not exclude a clinically meaningful difference.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence that a first dose of wP given early in infancy, compared to a first dose of aP, affects the risk of atopic diseases in children. The incidence of all-cause SAEs in wP and aP vaccinees was low, and no cases of encephalopathy were reported. The certainty of the evidence was judged as moderate for all-cause SAEs, and low for encephalopathy. Future studies should use sensitive and specific endpoints of clinical relevance, and should be conducted in settings with high prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy. Safety endpoints should prioritise common vaccine reactions, parental acceptability, SAEs and their potential relatedness to the dose administered.

### Do corticosteroids have a role in preventing or reducing acute toxic lung injury caused by inhalation of chemical agents? [^114KDp8s]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence that treatment with corticosteroids improves the outcome in those exposed to lung-damaging agents.

Methods

We searched Pubmed, Toxnet, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, and Embase from 1966 to January 2010 using the search terms "steroid", "corticosteroid", "lung injury", "lung damage", and "inhalation". These searches identified 287 papers of which 118 contained information on animal studies. However, most were reviews or case reports and only a few were controlled animal experiments of which 13 were considered relevant. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Animal Studies

Corticosteroids have no beneficial effect at the alveolar level on acute lung injury, which is caused by inhalation of poorly water-soluble compounds (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phosgene) or following severe exposure to water-soluble compounds (e.g. chlorine, ammonia). In the recovery phase, corticosteroids may even be harmful, because corticosteroids hamper the division of type II alveolar cells and hamper the differentiation from type II into type I alveolar cells. The latter is important for the re-epithelialization of the alveolus and removal of excess of water in the alveolus. Furthermore, the quality of animal studies does not always allow extrapolation to human exposures. Differences between humans and animals in anatomy, pulmonary defense systems, breathing physiology, as well as the way the animals have been exposed, and the timing and route of corticosteroids in animal studies make predictions difficult. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Human Studies

An abundance of uncontrolled case reports and a few human crossover studies have evaluated the outcome of human volunteers exposed to various lung-damaging agents. Only a few reports contained systematic information on corticosteroid treatment. Data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive. Often the number of patients involved is small or the severity of exposure is unclear or not well determined. These reports are therefore limited in their ability to establish a cause-effect relationship for the treatments involved. In some studies involving mild to moderate exposure to water-soluble agents (e.g. chlorine, ammonia), corticosteroid treatment was beneficial for some physiological parameters, such as airway resistance or arterial oxygen tension. However, severe lung injury and inflammation appear not to be improved by corticosteroid treatment. The optimal duration of treatment to obtain these beneficial effects has not been assessed adequately, but it only seems to be useful in the first hours after exposure. Generally, studies evaluating exposure to water-soluble compounds have too short a follow-up, which hampers the evaluation of the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. The results of studies with longer follow-up suggest that the initial slight improvement in some variables is lost several hours after exposure.

Conclusions

Clinical data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive as the number of well-structured controlled studies is small and the indications for administration of corticosteroids are unclear. There have been no human controlled studies of high-dose exposure to lung-damaging agents. Furthermore, treatment with corticosteroids is limited by the potential side effects, such as prolonged neuromuscular weakness, deregulation of glucose metabolism, superinfection, and sepsis, which could diminish the chances for recovery.

### Caffeine to prevent respiratory failure and improve outcome in infant pertussis [^111JTJxd]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

Within 24 hours, the baby weaned off CPAP. Within 72 hours, he was off all respiratory support and had resumed breastfeeding. At 48 hours, a nasal swab PCR test was reported positive for B. pertussis. The patient and all family members were given a 5-day course of azithromycin. We monitored the baby for 48 more hours and discharged him home. He remains in normal health with no subsequent hospitalisations.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113Q31bD]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several findings of the current study were important for clinical practice: (a) laboratory confirmed pertussis can be present in children irrespective of cough duration; (b) children with pertussis with different cough durations have clinical features that are influenced by the child's age and immunization state; and(c) those with chronic cough have nonspecific cough, lacking characteristic symptoms. This may suggest that in the context of the likely underestimation of the burden of pertussis, the "one-size-fits-all" clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal to recognize this disease in a population and large comprehensive studies of children with all types of cough is required to confirm or refute our findings. This may make substantial inroads into increasing both the sensitivity and specificity in pertussis diagnosis, will impact public health.

This study also suggests that amoxicillin maybe an alternative for children with marolide-resistant B.pertussis infection. But these analysis were only based on the in vitro test, as the dose and course of treatment were not clear. Clinical studies should be designed and performed to confirm that this alternative drug could eliminate the bacteria in vivo effectively.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^114ic1ii]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

Oral antibiotic treatment with clarithromycin was prescribed (500 mg two times per day for 2 weeks) as an attempt at causal treatment. Macrolides are recommended as the standard treatment for B. pertussis infection, preferably during the early course. The dyspnoea, coughing and facial swelling gradually decreased during hospitalisation and consequently, the patient was able to be dismissed after 9 days.

### Adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 2012 update [^114GX1hT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Pertussis-containing vaccines — The most serious adverse effect is severe encephalopathy; the estimated additional risk attributed to the vaccine is 0 to 10 per million doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and this is an absolute contraindication to further pertussis vaccination (including acellular pertussis). Less severe apparent neurologic events, including febrile seizures, inconsolable crying, and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, do not result in permanent sequelae, are not contraindications to further doses, and serious and less serious neurologic events have been significantly reduced since changing from DTP to the DTaP.

Materials and methods

Trial selection

Randomised controlled trials in critically ill patients evaluating corticosteroid therapy versus no corticosteroid therapy in severe sepsis or septic shock were considered for inclusion. Only trials reporting mortality were included. We excluded: studies reporting only physiological endpoints (for example, changes in immunological variables); descriptive studies; retrospective cohort studies; studies in the pediatric population; and studies exclusively reporting series of meningitis, typhoid fever and pneumonia where sub-set analyses of patients of interest (for this meta-analysis) were not reported. Where there was missing data or ambiguity of data presentation, attempts were made to contact the study author(s) to resolve these issues.

Search strategy and quality assessment

An extensive computerized literature search was performed (SR) for the period of 1950 to September 2008 using the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE via OVID, OVID PreMedline, EBSCO Cinahl, OVID Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, American College of Physicians Journal Club, Health Technology Assessment Database and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We restricted the search to studies on adult human populations and used the Mesh, Embase and Cinahl thesaurus in addition to free text searching. The following terms were identified as the most relevant: sepsis or bacteremia or fungemia or pneumonia or septicemia or septic shock narrowed down with the terms hydrocortisone or corticosteroids or adrenal cortex hormones or steroids. The set was then further limited to randomised controlled trials or clinical trials or multicenter study and trials published in English. A detailed search strategy is provided in Additional file 1.

We reviewed the abstracts of trials generated by the electronic search and the full text of trials pertaining to corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock were retrieved for a more detailed evaluation. Review articles were examined to identify additional trials. In addition a hand search of the proceedings of scientific meetings of the following journals was performed: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chest, Critical Care Medicine, European Respiratory Journal, Intensive Care Medicine and Thorax.

Quality assessment

Three investigators (JLM, PLG, and AB) reviewed studies fulfilling inclusion criteria and pre-defined variables and outcomes were abstracted into standardized data abstraction forms. Quality assessment on the published studies was performed in an un-blinded fashion by two investigators (JLM, PLG) using the 11-point quality score of Cronin and colleagues. Where there were differences in scoring, a consensus was reached. Extracted data was separately entered, reviewed and verified by two investigators (JLM, PLG) prior to analysis.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^111MxqzP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^116danuM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (PD and HR, or JY and HR) independently assessed the risk of bias for each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). We resolved any differences of opinion through discussion with reference to the trial reports, and through discussion with the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Co‐ordinating Editor, Paul Garner. We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps had been taken to reduce the risk of bias across six domains.

Random sequence generation
Allocation concealment
Blinding of participants and personnel
Blinding of outcome assessors
Incomplete outcome data
Selective reporting
Other bias

When assessing risk of bias related to blinding (performance bias or detection bias), we planned to consider the implications of blinding separately for each outcome, as appropriate.

For assessment of bias related to incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), we used the following criteria to assess risk of bias.

Low risk: less than 5% of participants were lost to follow‐up
Unclear risk: between 5 and 10% of participants were lost to follow‐up
High risk: more than 10% of participants were lost to follow‐up

For selective reporting (reporting bias), we used the following criteria to determine the risk of bias.

Low risk: the trial authors stated in the introduction or method sections the outcomes they would look at, and they reported all of them in the results section
Unclear risk: the trial authors did not state in the introduction or method sections the outcomes they would look at
High risk: the trial authors stated the outcomes they would look at but they did not report all of them in the results section

We categorized these judgments as either at low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification if any details were unclear; where our judgement is recorded as 'unclear' we were unable to amend our judgement after we contacted the trial authors. The results of the 'Risk of bias' assessment are displayed in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' tables.

Measures of treatment effect

For dichotomous outcomes, we used relative risk as the measure of treatment effect for analysis. For continuous outcomes we planned to use mean difference, but this was not necessary in the final review draft.

Unit of analysis issues

There were no cluster‐RCTs amongst the included trials, so individual participants were the unit of analysis.

### Efficacy and safety of pertussis vaccination for pregnant women-a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^113cSM5V]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pertussis remains a major health problem among children. Despite infant vaccination programmes with high coverage rates, many industrialized countries have recently experienced pertussis outbreaks. This is partially due to waning immunity following vaccination, which typically occurs 4–12 years after the last booster dose or episode of illness, as well as to decreases in natural immunity. Pertussis in adults can be a source of infection for infants under 2 months of age who have not yet been vaccinated. These first few months are the period when infants are at greatest risk of developing pertussis infection and serious complications such as pneumonia, seizures or brain damage, any of which could ultimately be fatal.

In seeking potential strategies for preventing pertussis in infants, vaccinating babies at birth was not considered as the best protection against pertussis. This is because newborns' immune systems cannot create antibodies until they are 2 months old, so vaccination cannot immediately protect them. Instead, maternal immunisation is considered the only available option for protecting infants against pertussis from birth until the first vaccinations are given at 2 months. Vaccinating women in pregnancy is believed to protect infants from pertussis in two ways. First, it is likely to increase the transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies through the placenta and through breast milk. Second, vaccination during pregnancy is likely to prevent maternal infection at the time of delivery, which, in turn, minimises the infant's potential exposure to pertussis.

During the 2011 outbreaks, the United States (US) became the first country to recommend that health care personnel administer pertussis-containing vaccines to pregnant women who were between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation. Pertussis vaccination during pregnancy is now recommended in several countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Israel, to protect infants from the infection. The rate of pertussis immunisation during pregnancy, however, varies across and within countries. In the UK, approximately 60% of pregnant women received a pertussis vaccine in 2014. A US study reported that nearly 50% of women (n = 5992/12,089) who delivered in Wisconsin from November 2013 to March 2014 received a pertussis-containing vaccine (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis: Tdap) during pregnancy. There are several factors influencing on uptake of maternal pertussis vaccination such as maternal level of education, maternal work situation and parity. Studies suggest that one of the main reasons for low immunisation rates is clinicians' and/or women's concerns about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^112ajs61]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.
