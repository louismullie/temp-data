## Question

Pediatric medication for sneezing, coughing, rhinorrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric medications for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the cough duration and likely etiologies. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and examination that distinguish viral URTI, allergic rhinitis, and bacterial sinusitis. Next, I will review first-line therapies for each condition, including safety caveats by age. After that, I need to check escalation strategies and when to consider antibiotics, imaging, or surgery. Finally, I will confirm follow-up intervals, red flags, and special situations like COVID-19 and pertussis, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the cough duration framework because it drives the differential and management. Acute cough is less than 2–3 weeks, subacute around 3–8 weeks, and chronic is more than 8 weeks in children, with most acute coughs due to viral URTIs that are self-limited, whereas chronic cough mandates an etiology-based approach rather than empiric trials unless specific features are present [^111GyBva] [^116Zz2be] [^1174isjq].

> Wait, let me verify the key history and exam features that separate viral URTI, allergic rhinitis, and bacterial rhinosinusitis. Viral URTI typically presents with acute onset, fever, myalgias, and symptoms peaking within 3 days and resolving in 10–14 days, whereas allergic rhinitis features clear rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal/ocular itch, pale or bluish edematous turbinates, and a personal or family atopic history, and bacterial acute rhinosinusitis is suggested by persistent nasal discharge and/or daytime cough beyond 10 days without improvement, severe onset with fever 39°C and purulent discharge for 3+ days, or worsening after initial improvement [^112CBRBR] [^115hFZPU] [^1118BtKs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for cough; I should confirm the ABRS criteria before prescribing. Persistent illness beyond 10 days without improvement, severe onset with high fever and purulent discharge for at least 3 days, or worsening after initial improvement are the accepted pediatric ABRS triggers, and when present, high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate is first-line, with duration typically 10–14 days, while observation with close follow-up is reasonable for persistent nonsevere presentations in select cases [^1118BtKs] [^115Sjbnr] [^112p63Z3].

> I will now examine first-line management for presumed viral URTI, and I need to ensure I avoid ineffective or unsafe therapies. Supportive care is the mainstay, with analgesics/antipyretics as needed, adequate hydration, and nasal saline irrigation, which modestly improves rhinologic symptoms and may reduce other interventions; importantly, routine OTC cough and cold medications are not recommended due to limited efficacy and safety concerns, codeine is contraindicated under 18 years, and antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness, so I should counsel families accordingly [^111GyBva] [^114W5nkt] [^1135GYQg] [^111dsQHp].

> Let me consider allergic rhinitis next, and I should double-check the hierarchy of therapies. Intranasal corticosteroids are strongly recommended for children with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis whose symptoms impair quality of life, with second-generation oral antihistamines as an alternative for those with predominant sneezing and itching; intranasal antihistamines are an option, particularly for rapid-onset relief, and saline irrigation can augment intranasal steroid efficacy, while allergen avoidance and, if pharmacotherapy fails, immunotherapy should be considered [^112FVUn4] [^111tXiaK] [^1177BnkU] [^115HvJ8V].

> But wait, what if symptoms suggest ABRS rather than viral URTI or allergic rhinitis; I should confirm the antibiotic choice and duration. High-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate is first-line for 10–14 days, with fluoroquinolones reserved for type I penicillin hypersensitivity or failure of first-line therapy, and in regions with high invasive pneumococcal resistance or in children with severe infection, daycare attendance, age under 2 years, recent hospitalization, or recent antibiotics, higher-dose regimens are advised; adjunct intranasal corticosteroids can modestly improve symptoms when added to antibiotics in ABRS [^112p63Z3] [^114PpfdV] [^112yBRCP].

> Next, I should review chronic cough management because the approach differs fundamentally from acute cough. For children with chronic cough, I need to ensure an etiology-based plan rather than empiric trials for upper airway cough syndrome, GERD, or asthma unless specific supportive features are present; validated cough outcomes and defined limited-duration trials, if used, help confirm or refute a hypothesis, and I should screen for and address environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke while setting realistic expectations with families [^116Zz2be] [^1174isjq] [^112kQBX4].

> I need to check escalation strategies for allergic rhinitis that remains uncontrolled. If monotherapy with intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines is insufficient, combination therapy with intranasal steroid plus intranasal antihistamine can be offered, and for refractory disease, immunotherapy is appropriate; for persistent nasal obstruction due to turbinate hypertrophy despite medical therapy, inferior turbinate reduction may be considered in selected patients [^112FVUn4] [^112sEp2i].

> Let me verify the approach to pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis, since cough and rhinorrhea often coexist. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigations are recommended, with adenoidectomy considered for medically refractory disease; systemic corticosteroids may be used in select severe cases but not as monotherapy, and functional endoscopic sinus surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms despite maximal medical therapy and adenoidectomy, with evidence that limited pediatric FESS improves symptoms without long-term facial growth impact [^113mEew1] [^114TaqPX] [^112adY6E] [^111mhEHd].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging cautions because unnecessary CT can cause harm. In children with chronic cough or suspected rhinosinusitis, routine sinus CT is not recommended due to radiation risks that are about 10-fold higher than in adults; CT should be reserved for suspected complications or refractory cases after specialist input, and chest CT likewise should be minimized given lifetime cancer risk estimates in young children [^115cKEwH].

> I should confirm special situations that can mimic or complicate the course. COVID-19 in children often includes cough and fever, with rhinorrhea and sneezing less prominent, so testing and isolation guidance should follow local public health protocols, while pertussis presents with a prolonged paroxysmal cough after a catarrhal phase and warrants macrolide therapy and public health notification; in both scenarios, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion based on exposure risks and symptom chronology [^1121BgaB] [^114VKUv8].

> Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: I initially thought decongestants might help rhinorrhea broadly, but I should double-check the evidence. For acute viral rhinosinusitis, antihistamines and decongestants have not shown clear benefit in children, and topical decongestants carry risks of rebound if used beyond 3–5 days, so I should avoid routine decongestants and, if considered for severe mucosal edema, limit to very short courses with counseling on rebound risk [^115A5y7R] [^113MV1hA].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment intervals to ensure timely adjustment. For allergic rhinitis, reassess in 7–14 days after initiating or changing therapy to gauge control and adherence, and for chronic cough, use validated tools and predefined response thresholds to judge whether an empiric trial has succeeded or failed within a set window, adjusting the diagnostic and therapeutic plan accordingly [^115nu8E7] [^116Zz2be].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety counseling is explicit. Codeine-containing medications should be avoided in children under 18 years due to respiratory risk, honey may be used for children over 1 year with acute cough but not in infants under 1 year because of botulism risk, and families should be educated on infection prevention including hand hygiene and cough etiquette during viral illnesses to reduce transmission [^1135GYQg] [^1178JuvT] [^116DrSBn].

For pediatric sneezing, cough, and rhinorrhea, **intranasal corticosteroids are first-line** for allergic rhinitis with sneezing and rhinorrhea [^112FVUn4], and **second-generation oral antihistamines** are added for sneezing and itching [^112FVUn4]. For acute viral URTI, use **saline irrigation** [^114W5nkt] and avoid antihistamines, decongestants, and cough suppressants due to limited benefit and potential harm [^111GyBva] [^1178JuvT]. If cough persists > 10 days or worsens, evaluate for bacterial sinusitis and treat with **amoxicillin-clavulanate** [^1118BtKs] [^112p63Z3]. Avoid **first-generation antihistamines**, codeine, and OTC cough/cold meds in young children [^111dsQHp] [^112i5hFt].

## Pharmacological management

### Allergic rhinitis

- **Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS)**: first-line for moderate-to-severe or persistent symptoms; reduce sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion [^112FVUn4] [^111tXiaK].

- **Second-generation oral antihistamines**: cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine for sneezing and itching; less sedating and safer than first-generation agents [^112FVUn4] [^117LsoKJ].

- **Intranasal antihistamines**: azelastine or olopatadine for rapid relief; consider in combination with INCS for refractory symptoms [^116Cmejr] [^112FVUn4].

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists**: montelukast for coexisting asthma or when INCS/antihistamines are inadequate [^116taeyX] [^115TzZet].

---

### Acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)

- **Saline nasal irrigation**: reduces nasal symptoms and cough; safe for all ages [^114W5nkt] [^116yhLrd].

- **Honey**: for children ≥ 1 year with acute cough; avoid in infants < 1 year due to botulism risk [^1178JuvT] [^111GyBva].

- **Avoid antihistamines and decongestants**: limited benefit and potential harm in young children [^111GyBva] [^111dsQHp].

---

### Acute bacterial sinusitis

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is **first-line** for 10–14 days [^112p63Z3] [^115Sjbnr]; use high-dose regimens in high-resistance areas or severe cases [^112p63Z3]. Adjunctive **intranasal corticosteroids** can reduce nasal inflammation and symptoms [^112yBRCP] [^112udp56].

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

- **First-generation antihistamines**: avoid due to sedation, anticholinergic effects, and cognitive impairment [^116gXLtd].

- **Codeine-containing cough medications**: contraindicated in children < 18 years due to respiratory depression risk [^1135GYQg] [^111dsQHp].

- **OTC cough and cold medications**: avoid in children < 2 years; limited efficacy and risk of adverse effects [^111dsQHp] [^112i5hFt].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures include **allergen avoidance** — identifying and minimizing exposure to triggers such as dust mites, pollen, and pet dander [^112FVUn4] [^117LsoKJ] — and **environmental controls**, including using HEPA filters, maintaining regular cleaning, and controlling humidity [^112FVUn4]. Patient and caregiver education should emphasize proper medication use, adherence, and when to seek medical attention [^114B8gbt] [^1143wjHT].

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Condition** | **First-line treatment** | **Second-line treatment** | **Medications to avoid** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Allergic rhinitis | - Intranasal corticosteroids <br/> - Second-generation antihistamines | - Leukotriene receptor antagonists <br/> - Intranasal antihistamines | - First-generation antihistamines |
| Acute viral URTI | - Saline irrigation <br/> - Honey (≥ 1 year) | - Supportive care | - Antihistamines <br/> - Decongestants <br/> - Cough suppressants |
| Acute bacterial sinusitis | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate | - Adjunctive intranasal corticosteroids | - First-generation antihistamines <br/> - Codeine-containing medications |

---

## Conclusion

Intranasal corticosteroids and second-generation antihistamines are **first-line** for pediatric allergic rhinitis with sneezing and rhinorrhea [^112FVUn4] [^117LsoKJ]. For acute viral URTI, use saline irrigation and honey (≥ 1 year) [^114W5nkt] [^1178JuvT]; avoid antihistamines, decongestants, and cough suppressants [^1178JuvT]. Treat suspected bacterial sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanate [^112p63Z3] and consider adjunctive intranasal corticosteroids [^112yBRCP]. Avoid first-generation antihistamines, codeine, and OTC cough/cold medications in young children due to safety concerns [^111dsQHp] [^116gXLtd].

### Allergic rhinitis: treatment based on patient profiles [^114B8gbt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a common medical condition characterized by nasal, throat, and ocular itching; rhinorrhea; sneezing; nasal congestion; and, less frequently, cough. The treatment of allergic rhinitis should control these symptoms without adversely affecting daily activities or cognitive performance and should prevent sequelae such as asthma exacerbation or sinusitis. This review describes a stepwise approach to treatment of allergic rhinitis derived from a synthesis of clinical trial results, patient preferences, and real-world tolerability data. Key clinical considerations include frequency and intensity of symptoms, patient age, comorbidities, compliance with treatment regimens (influenced by formulation, route and frequency of administration), and effects on quality of life. Oral second-generation antihistamines, versus first-generation agents and inhaled corticosteroids, should be considered first-line treatment because they provide rapid relief of most allergic rhinitis symptoms without safety and tolerability issues. Additional therapeutic agents can then be added or substituted based on individual symptom response.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115qEvM5]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Upper airway disorders in children — rhinosinusitis and cough: Cough is included in the symptom complex of both acute (> 10 days) and chronic (> 90 days) rhinosinusitis, and in both conditions the recommended first-line treatment is antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 7–10 and 20 days, respectively; however, to date no studies have undertaken FB in children with acute or chronic sinusitis to determine if chronic cough is related to lower airway infection. Pediatric reports of 'upper airways cough syndrome' were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and most used antibiotics, and a RCT in adolescents and adults with allergic rhinitis (n = 245) showed a significant daytime cough difference between mometasone furoate and placebo (P = .049) with no difference in nighttime cough.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112CBRBR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Pediatric allergic rhinitis: treatment [^116taeyX]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, an IgE-mediated disease, is the most common chronic childhood condition and is characterized by nasal sneezing, rhinorrhea, palate and eye itchiness, and congestion. Allergic rhinitis should be diagnosed as early as possible to avoid detrimental effects on the quality of life and comorbid disorders. Treatment initially involves avoidance measures and, when necessary, pharmacotherapy or immunotherapy. Pharmacotherapy generally involves antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids, but other medications such as leukotriene antagonists have demonstrated effectiveness in treating allergic rhinitis symptoms. Immunotherapy generally is reserved for patients unresponsive to therapy or unable to take medications.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116Zz2be]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — etiology-based management, empiric trials, research methods, and contextual factors: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend basing the management on the etiology of the cough, and an empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that if an empirical trial is used based on features consistent with a hypothesized diagnosis, the trial should be of a defined limited duration in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized diagnosis. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that clinical studies aimed at evaluating cough etiologies use validated cough outcomes, use a-priori defined response and diagnosis, and take into account the period effect, and undertake a period of follow-up. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that exacerbating factors such as environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be determined and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated, and we suggest that parental (and when appropriate the child's) expectations be determined, and their specific concerns sought and addressed.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

Intranasal steroids (INS) for ABRS in children — Adjunct and monotherapy evidence: In a pediatric trial, 89 children with ABRS received amoxicillin — clavulanate and were randomized to budesonide or placebo nasal sprays for 3 weeks, with significant improvements in cough and nasal discharge at the end of the second week in the steroid group; several trials in mixed adult and pediatric populations (usually 12 — 14 years and older) show similar benefits, and therefore there is reasonable evidence to support adding an INS to antibiotics. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients older than 12 years, 200 μg of mometasone twice daily (twice the allergic rhinitis dose) was more effective than placebo and amoxicillin, suggesting some evidence that a high dose of INS in older children might be effective as monotherapy, although generalizing to younger children is not justified without more studies.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Allergic rhinitis – current pharmacotherapy [^116U67eW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The use of pharmacotherapy for allergic rhinitis remains a central strategy in the integrated treatment of the patient. The most appropriate medical therapy depends upon the nature of specific rhinitis symptoms, patient tolerance to and preference for certain classes of medications, and response to treatment. Through an appreciation of these various physiological mechanisms, the physician can select the treatment option or options that will be most likely to effectively manage symptoms.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1174isjq]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — treatment and evaluation of treatment for children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough — states "we recommend basing the management on the etiology of the cough. An empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present (Grade 1A.)"; additionally, "we suggest that if an empirical trial is used based on features consistent with a hypothesized diagnosis, the trial should be of a defined limited duration in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized diagnosis (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)" and "we suggest that clinical studies aimed at evaluating cough etiologies use validated cough outcomes, use a-priori defined response and diagnosis, and take into account the period effect, and undertake a period of follow-up (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)".

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^116DrSBn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette — secretions, covering, distancing, and masks: Since it is not always known if a person is contagious when they have respiratory symptoms including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, or increased production of respiratory secretions, all respiratory secretions are potentially infectious. A person should cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, immediately dispose of the tissue in a waste receptacle, and perform hand hygiene when finished; if tissues are not readily available, then sneezing or coughing into one's sleeve or elbow is safer than sneezing or coughing into the air, although use caution if an infant or child may be held in one's arms and encounter soiled sleeves. Many viruses and bacteria are transmitted through the air, and a common and practical suggestion is that vulnerable patients should remain at least 3–6 feet (1–2 m) away from individuals who are coughing or sneezing; this may not prevent all infections. The medical team will advise patients with weakened immune systems to avoid crowded places and to wear masks when they are in public areas for additional protection against respiratory tract infections, and these surgical masks, sometimes referred to as isolation masks, cover the mouth and nose, but do not fit tightly on the face; if someone is coughing near a child who is vulnerable, move the child away or ask the coughing person to move away and cover their cough.

### Management of rhinitis: guidelines, evidence basis, and systematic clinical approach for what we do [^112VEBbt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Whereas very mild rhinitis may be simply and successfully self-managed by patients using medications available over the counter, most patients with rhinitis who present to medical offices have more severe rhinitis that may need a more comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Optimal care may require special diagnostic studies and combination therapies that are arrived at only after trying multiple different medication and therapeutic options. This article presents a systematic approach to office care of rhinitis from the perspective of an allergist-immunologist. More emphasis is given to discussion of dilemmas that face the specialist or more involved considerations that have been highlighted in recently published guidelines.

### Decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis in children [^115A5y7R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation in children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines or nasal irrigation in improving symptoms of acute sinusitis in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to June week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1950 to June 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, which evaluated children younger than 18 years of age with acute sinusitis, defined as 10 to 30 days of rhinorrhea, congestion or daytime cough. We excluded trials of children with chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed each study for inclusion.

Main Results

Of the 662 studies identified through the electronic searches and handsearching, none met all the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to determine whether the use of antihistamines, decongestants or nasal irrigation is efficacious in children with acute sinusitis. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions are beneficial in the treatment of children with acute sinusitis.

Children with cough, in particular chronic cough, are sometimes referred to otolaryngologists for assessment, diagnosis, and management. Although the likely diagnoses encountered by otolaryngologists are rhinosinusitis, foreign body aspiration, and tracheomalacia, otolaryngologists should be cognizant of the many other possible diagnoses and the evidence for and against their association. This article highlights and focuses the discussion on the cough issues relevant to otolaryngologists.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^114D1wWo]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Management

Guideline-directed management has been shown to improve disease control. The global Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guideline (ARIA), which includes quality-of-life measures in evaluation and treatment, and provides an evidence-based approach to treatment of AR, has recently been updated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology. The UK has its own guidelines, which are currently being updated. More recent, specifically paediatric guidelines, include those from the European Academy for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)and patient pathways from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The following is a synopsis of their content.

Diagnosis

AR is diagnosed by detailed history, including questions about possible asthma, and nasal examination, together with inspection of throat, ears and chest where possible, backed up by specific allergy tests, either skin prick or blood tests, for specific IgE to allergens suggested by the history.

Clinical history: symptom type, duration and frequency and exacerbating factors are the cornerstone for diagnosing and classifying paediatric rhinitis which is characterised by two or more nasal symptoms: itching, sneezing, obstruction and rhinorrhoea. The timing of these in relation to exposure to allergen (ie, specific season or animal) is highly relevant. Upon such exposure, symptoms of AR occur in minutes and last for hours. Late-phase symptoms can include nasal obstruction, hyposmia, postnasal mucous discharge and nasal hyper-reactivity. AC occurs in approximately 50%–70% of patients with ARand is the symptom which best differentiates AR from other forms of rhinitis.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### The approach to pediatric cough [^116NLqy5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of pediatric cough, with specific emphasis on various causes, to aid in diagnosis and treatment.

Data Sources

Relevant articles and references published between January 1, 1961, and May 1, 2009, were found through a PubMed search using the following keywords: pediatric cough and cough in children.

Study Selection

All key relevant articles and textbook sections were reviewed, and the most relevant were selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

Although asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postnasal drip can be causes of cough in children, it is important to think of other potential causes, such as bronchitis, postviral cough, and foreign-body inhalation. Testing and treatment for cough will vary, depending on the presentation and diagnosis. Just as in adults, in children, the cause of cough can be multifactorial.

Conclusions

Pediatric cough is commonly encountered by primary care physicians and allergists. Physicians should be aware of the various potential causes of cough in children to properly determine the cause so that testing and treatment can proceed appropriately.

The relationship between allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis has been assessed in a number of observational and experimental studies. In this review, we attempt their synthesis and evaluation using the modified Bradford Hill guidelines for causation. Although there is no proof of causation, especially in the pediatric literature, an evaluation of underlying allergies is recommended at least as an initial measure of symptoms relief.

### Pediatric allergic rhinitis: factors affecting treatment choice [^116gXLtd]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is the mostprevalent chronic allergic disease in children. Although it is not life-threatening, it can have a significantly detrimental effect on a childs quality of life, and it may exacerbate a number of common comorbidities, including asthma and sinusitis. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines, an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, advocate the use of antihistamines for the treatment of the broad spectrum of the disease. However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with a number of adverse events, including central nervous system impairment and anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these agents have not been rigorously tested in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, first-generation antihistamines remain the most frequently prescribed agents in this class of drugs. This is despite the fact that the second-generation antihistamines are largely free of the undesirable side effects associated with their predecessors and the fact that they have been shown to be effective in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms in children in a number of large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, when selecting an antihistamine for a child, it would be prudent to consider the full range of antihistamines and to base the selection of a particular drug on its efficacy, onset and duration of action, and safety profile.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116yhLrd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) supportive care and natural history note that acute VRS is estimated to occur from 2 to 5 times per year in the average adult, secondary bacterial infection is believed to complicate only 0.5% to 2.0% of these events, and symptoms typically peak within 3 days then decline and resolve within 10 to 14 days. Management is symptomatic: antibiotics are not recommended for treating VRS as antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness and do not provide direct symptom relief, and palliative medications — non-narcotic analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, acetaminophen), nasal saline, decongestants, antihistamines, mucolytics, cough suppressants, and topical or oral corticosteroids — may be used alone or in varying combinations for symptom relief. Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea but does not alleviate other viral symptoms, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents do not improve nasal discharge but improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia, and should be used with caution in older adults. Nasal saline may be palliative and cleansing with low risk of adverse reactions, with minor improvements in nasal symptom scores reported and a meta-analysis indicating that higher volume irrigations may be superior. For decongestants, in 2023 the FDA advisory committee discouraged the use of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant; use of up to 3 to 5 days of topical oxymetazoline may be beneficial but clinicians should warn patients against paradoxical rebound congestion with use greater than 3 days; pseudoephedrine could be considered beyond this, although recent evidence is lacking and the patient should be counseled regarding contraindications of elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Commonly used antihistamines show no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or sneezing, and first-generation varieties should be avoided in older adults. While not supported by a large body of evidence, topical corticosteroids in VRS is an option for symptomatic relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 13 and greater effect with longer courses and higher doses. Diagnostic caveats include that nasal purulence alone does not indicate a bacterial infection.

A meta-analysis reported an 88% success rate with a low complication rate, and long-term follow-up showed no impact on pediatric facial growth up to 10 years postoperatively. A limited FESS approach has yielded significant improvements: nasal obstruction (91%), rhinorrhea (90%), post nasal drainage (90%), headache (97%), hyposmia (89%), and chronic cough (96%). Overall, the most supported approach after failed maximal medical therapy probably begins with adenoidectomy with a maxillary sinus wash.

For younger children, "the application of recommendations to children would be partially based on data extrapolation from adult studies and would therefore be less certain". Because "GRADE documents require a comprehensive literature search, systematic review, and meta-analysis for each question", resource constraints mean "the only GRADE recommendations are those that were previously published in the 2017 rhinitis guideline update". The remainder are "consensus-based statements (CBSs)", for which "The strength of the CBSs is determined to be either strong or conditional" and "The certainty of evidence for each recommendation is determined to be high, moderate, low, or very low". Development steps include that "At least 2 work group members are assigned to write and review each section" and that "all sections are reviewed and revised by the entire work group through several rounds of electronic and teleconference reviews".

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111mhqRu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking).

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Paediatric rhinitis: position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^115TzZet]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Rhinitis is a common problem in childhood and adolescence and impacts negatively on physical, social and psychological well-being. This position paper, prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Taskforce on Rhinitis in Children, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and therapy of paediatric rhinitis. Rhinitis is characterized by at least two nasal symptoms: rhinorrhoea, blockage, sneezing or itching. It is classified as allergic rhinitis, infectious rhinitis and nonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis. Similar symptoms may occur with other conditions such as adenoidal hypertrophy, septal deviation and nasal polyps. Examination by anterior rhinoscopy and allergy tests may help to substantiate a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Avoidance of relevant allergens may be helpful for allergic rhinitis (AR). Oral and intranasal antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids are both appropriate for first-line AR treatment although the latter are more effective. Once-daily forms of corticosteroids are preferred given their improved safety profile. Potentially useful add-on therapies for AR include oral leukotriene receptor antagonists, short bursts of a nasal decongestant, saline douches and nasal anticholinergics. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is helpful in IgE-mediated AR and may prevent the progression of allergic disease. There are still a number of areas that need to be clarified in the management of rhinitis in children and adolescents.

### Treatment of allergic rhinitis [^112vNYJw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, a common and often debilitating disease marked by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, is on the increase worldwide. Treatment involves allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and, in selected cases, immunotherapy. This overview describes the characteristics, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The major contributing allergens of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are identified. Pharmacotherapy is described within the context of treatment guidelines developed by the major asthma and allergy professional organizations. Oral H1 antihistamines are first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate allergic rhinitis. The newer, nonsedating agents are recommended over first-generation antihistamines. Some of the newer oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine, have been shown to relieve the symptom of nasal congestion. Intranasal steroids are first-line therapy for patients with more severe symptoms.

Methods

Study design and population

The study has a cross-sectional design. Survey participants were selected from patients presenting classical respiratory symptoms (like: sneezing, watery nasal discharge, cough, nasal obstruction) and seeking for medical advice for the first time between May 2015 and November 2017 in pediatric allergy outpatient clinic, Beijing Children's Hospital. The diagnosis and assessment of asthma was evaluated according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria, and allergic rhinitis was diagnosed according to the ARIA. Exclusion criteria were as following: (1)Having received standard treatment protocol for allergic diseases(asthma, allergic rhinitis); (2)refuse to complete survey questionnaire; (3)information missing or logic error in a questionnaire; (4)withdrawal from the study; (5)having receiving skin testing previously; (6)children who had taken anti-histamine medication within 7 days prior to SPT; (7)refusal or intolerance to complete skin testing.

This study was approved by Ethical Review Board of Beijing Children's Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were older than 6 years of age, or their parents.

### Intranasal steroids in the treatment of allergy-induced rhinorrhea [^113enWCv]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

While nasal congestion has been identified as one of the most bothersome and prevalent symptoms of allergic rhinitis, it is underappreciated that many patients find rhinorrhea also to be bothersome. Rhinorrhea as a symptom of allergic rhinitis virtually never occurs alone; about 97% of patients with allergic rhinitis suffer from at least two symptoms, a finding that underscores the advantage of treating a broad range of symptoms with a single medication. Along with sneezing and nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea is a classic acute symptom of allergic rhinitis; it appears as a late-phase symptom as well. In this review, the characterization and epidemiology of rhinorrhea, the pathophysiology of rhinorrhea in allergic rhinitis, the roles played by mediators in early- and late-phase rhinorrhea, the prevalence and impact of this symptom, and the efficacy and safety of available treatment options are all discussed in context of relevant literature. A review of the clinical studies assessing the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids (INS) for rhinorrhea is presented. Many clinical studies and several meta-analyses conclusively demonstrate that, in addition to being safe and well-tolerated, INS are more effective than other agents (including oral and intranasal antihistamines) across the spectrum of AR symptoms, including rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.

Imaging risk considerations in pediatric chronic cough note that radiation risk from CT should be weighed carefully: "children have 10 times increased risk compared to middle aged adults" and "For a single CT examination of 200 mA, lifetime attributable cancer mortality risk is 1 in 1000 to 2500 for a 2.5-year-old child". Accordingly, chest and sinus CTs "should rarely be performed unless other symptoms are present and ideally with prior consultation with a pediatric respiratory specialist".

### Long-term outcome of once daily nasal irrigation for the treatment of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis [^114CiMDn]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Chronic rhinosinusitis(CRS) results in significant morbidity and health care expenditure. Safety and efficacy of nasal irrigation use in the treatment of pediatric CRS have been demonstrated, but long-term outcomes are unknown. We reviewed characteristics and treatment outcomes after 6 weeks of once daily nasal irrigation in pediatric CRS based on computed tomography (CT) scans, and summarized parental reports of subsequent use of nasal irrigation for recurring symptoms

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study and cross-sectional survey.

Methods

Review and survey of 144 pediatric CRS patients diagnosed between July 2003 and January 2012.

Results

One hundred four patients were reviewed. Mean age was 8.0 years, and 65.4% were male. Presenting symptoms included congestion (95.2%), cough (79.8%), rhinorrhea (60.6%), headache (48.1%), and fatigue (40.4%). Comorbidities included positive allergy test (50%), asthma (57.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.2%). After 6 weeks, 57.7% of patients reported complete resolution of symptoms. Reductions in Lund-Mackay CT scores were 4.14 and 4.38 on the left and right sides, respectively (P < .001). Of the 54 parents who completed the prospective surveys, 53.7% reported using irrigation again in the past 12 months (median = 1, interquartile range = 3). Only nine patients underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) after the initial 6 weeks. Patients requiring FESS were, on average, 3.6 years older than those who did not receive FESS (P = 0.0005). Median length of follow-up was 48 months (range = 20–113). There were no significant differences in age, Lund-MacKay score changes, and symptom resolution proportions between those who completed the survey and those who did not.

Conclusions

Nasal irrigation is effective as a first-line treatment for pediatric CRS and subsequent nasal symptoms, and reduces the need for FESS and CT imaging.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114QUpan]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a highly prevalent symptom in children of all ages and in different regions of the world. Pediatric cough is most commonly caused by acute viral respiratory tract infection, though it can be triggered by numerous conditions including bacterial infection, allergic response, and asthma. Pediatric cough has a major impact on sleep, school performance, and the ability to play and, therefore, has a negative influence on children's quality of life. Pediatric cough is also a source of stress and anxiety for parents, due to its impact on children's behavior (e.g. refusing food) and sleep patterns, and the often unwarranted fear that it will escalate into a more serious health condition. Thus, pediatric cough is a major driver to seek medical attention, and is associated with high costs resulting from physician visits, diagnostic tests, and medications, thereby placing a high burden on healthcare systems.

Various local, national, and international organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines in order to standardize the treatment of cough in adults and/or children. However, these guidelines vary in quality, and recommendations are often based on low-quality evidence (observational studies or expert consensus, as opposed to randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Cough is a symptom of multiple diseases and, therefore, is managed by a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, while guidelines for adults outnumber those for children, adult guidelines do not translate well to children. Overall, there are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. The aims of this study were to identify and present therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients, at an international level, and to consider the clinical studies required to address these unmet needs. The aims are addressed through a review of current literature on pediatric cough, and expert opinion collected using a questionnaire.

### Pediatric COVID-19: systematic review of the literature [^1121BgaB]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is limited data regarding the demographics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data.

Results

Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1 day to 17 years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1 year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.18%.

Conclusion

In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

What AR patients want from treatment

Living with symptomatic AR means coping with any or all of the symptoms of nasal congestion, headache, postnasal drip, repeated sneezing, runny nose and other symptoms on a near-daily basis. AR patients have high expectations from their treatment, but also a high degree of dissatisfaction with AR treatment, for reasons that include: symptom breakthrough, lack of 24-hour coverage, lack of coverage of both nasal and ocular symptoms, and unwanted side effects. Patients want faster and more complete symptom control. Insufficient symptom control with INCS and oral AH is a major concern, and a situation, which has not improved over time. Many physicians underestimate AR severity and consequently fail to issue adequate treatment, a situation which appears to have changed little in a decade.

### Allergic rhinitis: a review [^117LsoKJ]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Allergic rhinitis affects an estimated 15% of the US population (approximately 50 million individuals) and is associated with the presence of asthma, eczema, chronic or recurrent sinusitis, cough, and both tension and migraine headaches.

Observations

Allergic rhinitis occurs when disruption of the epithelial barrier allows allergens to penetrate the mucosal epithelium of nasal passages, inducing a T-helper type 2 inflammatory response and production of allergen-specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis typically presents with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. In an international study, the most common symptoms of allergic rhinitis were rhinorrhea (90.38%) and nasal congestion (94.23%). Patients with nonallergic rhinitis present primarily with nasal congestion and postnasal drainage frequently associated with sinus pressure, ear plugging, muffled sounds and pain, and eustachian tube dysfunction that is less responsive to nasal corticosteroids. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis typically have physical examination findings of edematous and pale turbinates. Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis typically have erythematous and inflamed turbinates with serous secretions that appear similar to other forms of chronic rhinitis at physical examination. Patients with nonallergic rhinitis have negative test results for specific IgE aeroallergens. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring less than 4 consecutive days/week or less than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring more often than 4 consecutive days/week and for more than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Patients with allergic rhinitis should avoid inciting allergens. In addition, first-line treatment for mild intermittent or mild persistent allergic rhinitis may include a second-generation H1 antihistamine (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine) or an intranasal antihistamine (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), whereas patients with persistent moderate to severe allergic rhinitis should be treated initially with an intranasal corticosteroid (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) either alone or in combination with an intranasal antihistamine. In contrast, first-line therapy for patients with nonallergic rhinitis consists of an intranasal antihistamine as monotherapy or in combination with an intranasal corticosteroid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Allergic rhinitis is associated with symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be instructed to avoid inciting allergens. Therapies include second-generation H1 antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine), intranasal antihistamines (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), and intranasal corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) and should be selected based on the severity and frequency of symptoms and patient preference.

### Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116TqsqE]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review relevant literature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methodology

The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, review articles, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched and reviewed by a single author. The date of the last comprehensive search was December 5, 2003, and that of the Cochrane database was November 7, 2004. The authors' own databases and expertise identified additional articles.

Results/Conclusions

Pediatric chronic cough (ie, cough in children aged < 15 years) is defined as a daily cough lasting for > 4 weeks. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of URTIs in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough (ie, cough associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem) and nonspecific cough (ie, dry cough in the absence of an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology). The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology. A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are a general guideline only, do not substitute for sound clinical judgment, and are not intended to be used as a protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness. Children (aged < 15 years) with cough should be managed according to child-specific guidelines, which differ from those for adults as the etiologic factors and treatments for children are sometimes different from those for adults. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology, and there is no evidence for using medications for the symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, it is imperative that the children are followed up and therapy with the medications stopped if there is no effect on the cough within an expected time frame. An evaluation of the time to response is important. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences and parental expectations should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough often impacts the quality of life of both children and parents, and the exploration of parental expectations and fears is often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115nu8E7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Persistent allergic rhinitis — age 12 and older: population scope, severity assessment, and reassessment interval — Severity can be assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most severe; alternatively, patient and provider can define "mild" as normal daily activities, sport, leisure, work, school, sleep, and no troublesome symptoms, whereas "moderate/severe" indicates at least 1 abnormal or impaired item. While most medications are approved for children < 12 years old, comparative trials have, for the most part, been limited to those ≥ 12 years of age. The algorithm includes a reassessment interval of 7–14 days.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112sEp2i]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) diagnosis and treatment flow chart — patients who present with "Patient presents with the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing" should undergo history and physical examination (KAS1), "including assessment of chronic conditions and comorbidities (KAS5)", after which the "Physician determines clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis". When "Treatment Needed? - YES", options include "Pharmacologic Treatment (KAS 6–10): Refer to Figure 3: Medications Flow Chart for Common Clinical Scenarios", Environmental Factors (KAS4), where "Clinicians may advise avoidance of known or suspected allergens", and, if "Patient prefers Complementary Medicine", "Clinicians may offer acupuncture (KAS13)". For "Inadequate control of AR symptoms with pharmacologic therapy and/or environmental controls", proceed to "Allergy Testing (KAS2); Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing" as indicated; if positive, "Immunotherapy If Positive Allergy Testing (KAS11): Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with allergic rhinitis who have inadequate response to pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls". For persistent nasal obstruction, "Inferior Turbinate reduction: for Persistent Nasal Airway Obstruction (KAS12) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction" in patients with enlarged inferior turbinates "who have failed medical management".

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^115HvJ8V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment

This aims at safe and effective symptom relief plus prevention of complications and disease progression. There is evidence that outcomes are improved when evidence-based guidelines are applied. The ARIA guidelines are currently the most widely used in Europe for AR treatment. A recent revision published in 2010 answers specific paediatric questions. The EAACI guideline similarly suggests a stepwise therapeutic approach (figure 2).

Figure 2
Entry to therapy can occur at 1, 2 or 3 year, depending on severity of presenting symptoms. Poor control should lead to a step up, good control to a step down, so that the minimum therapy necessary is used. For seasonal disease, regular therapy should be commenced 2 weeks before the anticipated start of symptoms. *Oral antihistamines may be better tolerated, while intranasal antihistamines have a more rapid onset of action. **Reconsider diagnosis if not controlled within 1–2 weeks. If < 2 years of age and unresponsive to antihistamine within a week, reconsider diagnosis before stepping up therapy. If poorly controlled, consider a short rescue course of a decongestant or low-dose oral prednisolone to gain symptom control; topical ipratropium may be useful for rhinorrhoea (adapted from Roberts et al [33] (with permission)).

Allergen avoidance, where possible, is recommended across the spectrum of disease severity. Those suffering from hay fever are asymptomatic outside the pollen season and symptoms in nose and eyes are reduced by nasal air filters, and pet avoidance shows clear benefits; for house dust mite (HDM) reduction, individual measures gave equivocal results or lack of benefit.FA rarely causes isolated rhinitis, but can be relevant where there are additional gastrointestinal problems, asthma and/or atopic eczema in toddlers.

Saline douching: This reduces symptoms of AR and improves the effect of intranasal steroids (INS)and is effective in rhinosinusitis, where douching is guideline-recommended. Isotonic solutions are well tolerated, inexpensive, easy to use, with no evidence showing that regular, daily use adversely affects health. Other complementary therapies, such as homeopathy, acupuncture, butterbur and herbal medicines are not recommended.

### IDSA clinical practice guideline for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children and adults [^112p63Z3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to administer amoxicillin/clavulanate over amoxicillin alone as empiric antimicrobial therapy in pediatric patients with ABRS. (strong, moderate) Administer high-dose (90 mg/kg/day PO BID) amoxicillin/clavulanate in pediatric patients with ABRS from geographic regions with high endemic rates (≥ 10%) of invasive penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae, those with severe infection (evidence of systemic toxicity with fever ≥ 39 °C, and threat of suppurative complications), attendance at daycare, age < 2 years, recent hospitalization, antibiotic use within the past month, or immunocompromised condition.

### Face mask use and control of respiratory virus transmission in households [^111GbChA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Recruitment and Follow-up

Children 0–15 years of age seeking treatment at pediatric health services with fever (temperature > 37.8 o C) and either cough or sore throat were identified by an electronic triage system. Parents or primary caregivers were approached in the waiting room, and that household was invited to join the study if all of the following criteria were satisfied:) the household contained > 2 adults > 16 years of age and 1 child 0–15 years of age;) the index child had fever (temperature > 37.8 o C) and either a cough or sore throat;) the child was the first and only person to become ill in the family in the previous 2 weeks;) adult caregivers consented to participate in the study; and) the index child was not admitted to the hospital.

If eligibility criteria were satisfied, adults from the household were enrolled in the study. Enrolled adults and any siblings of the index child were then evaluated for respiratory symptoms and signs (fever, history of fever or feeling feverish in the past week, myalgia, arthralgia, sore throat, cough, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, headache). If any of these symptoms were present, the family and household were excluded. Sociodemographic and medical information including influenza vaccination history (both the index child and participating adults) was obtained using a researcher-administered questionnaire. Medication use was also recorded. The index case-patient had combined nasal (each nostril) and throat swabs collected for multiplex reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) testing. The household was randomized to 1 of the 3 arms, allocated the appropriate mask type, and educated about infection prevention. Formal fit testing of the P2 masks was not performed, but information pertaining to the correct method for fitting and disposing of the masks was provided. Over the next week, participants were contacted by telephone daily to determine if symptoms had developed and to record adherence to mask use throughout the day.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114W5nkt]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are the most common infections in infants and children. Saline nasal irrigation (SNI) is widely prescribed and recommended. We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of SNI in infants and children with acute rhinopharyngitis.

Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Medline, Embase and clinicalTrials.gov. Two authors selected randomized control trials (RCTs), including infants ≥ 3 months and children ≤ 12 years, comparing the use of isotonic saline solutions, whatever their mode of administration, with one therapeutic abstention, or a therapy deemed less important for nasal lavage. Trial quality was assessed independently by two authors, who, with a third author, extracted and analysed data. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The standard difference in means (SMD) between groups and its 95% confidence interval were estimated.

Results

Four RCTs (569 participants) were included. The analysis showed a benefit of SNI for certain clinical rhinological symptoms (SMD = -0.29 [-0.45; -0.13]) but no significant improvement of respiratory symptoms (SMD = -0.19 [-0.70; 1.08]) or health status (SMD = -0.30 [-0.68; 0.07]). Its use appeared to limit the prescription of other treatments, whether local or systemic, and particularly antibiotics. Long-term use led to a decrease in the incidence of acute rhinosinusitis and its complications. SNI appeared to be a safe treatment.

Conclusions

SNI is beneficial for rhinological symptoms but not respiratory symptoms. Further research is needed to address the full benefits/risks of this treatment.

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^115rfotL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa that is caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished, depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food and age. On a cellular molecular level different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack an effective treatment as a result of poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed in patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intranasal corticosteroids, delivered by any means and in any volume, with (a) placebo/no intervention or (b) other active treatments in adults and children (aged ≥ 12 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a significant adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were (disease-specific) health-related quality of life, objective measurements of airflow and other adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 34 studies (4452 participants); however, only 13 studies provided data for our main comparison, intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo. The participants were mainly defined as patients with perennial rhinitis symptoms and negative allergy tests. No distinction between different pheno- and endotypes could be made, although a few studies only included a specific phenotype such as pregnancy rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa or senile rhinitis. Most studies were conducted in a secondary or tertiary healthcare setting. No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Intranasal corticosteroid dosage in the review ranged from 50 µg to 2000 µg daily. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo Thirteen studies (2045 participants) provided data for this comparison. These studies used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data in each analysis using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to -0.33; 4 studies; 131 participants; I² = 22%) (low-certainty evidence). However, between four weeks and three months the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.20; 3 studies; 85 participants; I² = 0%) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may slightly improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score change from baseline when compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 4 studies; 1465 participants; I² = 35%) (low-certainty evidence). All four studies evaluating the risk of epistaxis showed that there is probably a higher risk in the intranasal corticosteroids group (65 per 1000) compared to placebo (31 per 1000) (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.57; 4 studies; 1174 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute risk difference (RD) was 0.04 with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 25 (95% CI 16.7 to 100). Only one study reported numerical data for quality of life. It did report a higher quality of life score in the intranasal corticosteroids group (152.3 versus 145.6; SF-12v2 range 0 to 800); however, this disappeared at longer-term follow-up (148.4 versus 145.6) (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies provided data for the outcome objective measurements of airflow. These data could not be pooled because they used different methods of outcome measurement. Neither found a significant difference between the intranasal corticosteroids and placebo group (rhinomanometry SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.14; 44 participants; peak expiratory flow rate SMD 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.03; 11 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids probably resulted in little or no difference in the risk of other adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3 studies; 1130 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids versus other treatments Only one or a few studies assessed each of the other comparisons (intranasal corticosteroids versus saline irrigation, intranasal antihistamine, capsaicin, cromoglycate sodium, ipratropium bromide, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroids with saline compared to saline alone). It is therefore uncertain whether there are differences between intranasal corticosteroids and other active treatments for any of the outcomes reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes in this review was low or very low. It is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids reduce patient-reported disease severity in non-allergic rhinitis patients compared with placebo when measured at up to three months. However, intranasal corticosteroids probably have a higher risk of the adverse effect epistaxis. There are very few studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids to other treatment modalities making it difficult to draw conclusions.

### Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines: 2010 revision [^112d2TFu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis represents a global health problem affecting 10% to 20% of the population. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines have been widely used to treat the approximately 500 million affected patients globally.

Objective

To develop explicit, unambiguous, and transparent clinical recommendations systematically for treatment of allergic rhinitis on the basis of current best evidence.

Methods

The authors updated ARIA clinical recommendations in collaboration with Global Allergy and Asthma European Network following the approach suggested by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group.

Results

This article presents recommendations about the prevention of allergic diseases, the use of oral and topical medications, allergen specific immunotherapy, and complementary treatments in patients with allergic rhinitis as well as patients with both allergic rhinitis and asthma. The guideline panel developed evidence profiles for each recommendation and considered health benefits and harms, burden, patient preferences, and resource use, when appropriate, to formulate recommendations for patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals.

Conclusion

These are the most recent and currently the most systematically and transparently developed recommendations about the treatment of allergic rhinitis in adults and children. Patients, clinicians, and policy makers are encouraged to use these recommendations in their daily practice and to support their decisions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115bUP1w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — epidemiology and scope: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized as one of the most common diseases affecting adults and as the most common chronic disease in children in the United States and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall, affecting nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generating $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually, with as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. The guideline is applicable to both pediatric and adult patients with AR, but children under the age of 2 years were excluded; there is considerable variation in use of diagnostic tests and treatments, and the recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or limit individual care.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^114VK9Md]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Saline nasal irrigation or lavage in acute sinusitis — pediatric and adult evidence: Saline nasal irrigation or lavage (not saline nasal spray) has been used to remove debris and temporarily reduce tissue edema to promote drainage, but there have been very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mixed results, and the 1 study in children showed greater improvement in nasal airflow, quality of life, and total symptom score compared with placebo in patients treated with antibiotics and decongestants. Adult data include 2 Cochrane reviews with variable results, with one review published in 2007 concluding it is a beneficial adjunct and the other published in 2010 concluding that most trials were too small or had too high a risk of bias to be confident about benefits.

### Placebo effect in the treatment of acute cough in infants and toddlers: a randomized clinical trial [^1111ZVy7]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cough is one of the most common reasons why children visit a health care professional.

Objectives

To compare the effect of a novel formulation of pasteurized agave nectar vs placebo and no treatment on nocturnal cough and the sleep difficulty associated with nonspecific acute cough in infants and toddlers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized clinical trial performed in 2 university-affiliated outpatient, general pediatric practices from January 28, 2013, through February 28, 2014, children 2 to 47 months old with nonspecific acute cough duration of 7 days or less were studied. Surveys were administered to parents on 2 consecutive days, the day of presentation (when no medication had been given the prior evening) and the next day (when agave nectar, placebo, or no treatment had been administered to their child before bedtime) according to a partially double-blind randomization scheme.

Interventions

A single dose of agave nectar, placebo, or no treatment administered 30 minutes before bedtime.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cough frequency, cough severity, cough bothersomeness, congestion severity, rhinorrhea severity, and cough effect on child and parent sleep.

Results

Significant differences in symptom improvement were detected between the study groups (P < .05 for all, except P = .06 for cough bothersomeness), with agave nectar and placebo proving to be superior to no treatment, but no significant differences for any outcome were found when comparing agave nectar against placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a comparison of agave nectar, placebo, and no treatment, a placebo effect was demonstrated, with no additional benefit offered by agave nectar. Health care professionals should consider the potential benefits and costs when recommending a treatment with only a placebo effect for infants and toddlers with nonspecific acute cough.

### Allergic rhinitis: broader disease effects and implications for management [^114ubMLX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a burdensome disease for a significant part of the population in both adults and children. Poorly controlled allergic rhinitis can trigger exacerbations of asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media, diseases with which it shares common pathophysiologic elements. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment should be a priority for patients and physicians, not only to control the symptoms of allergic rhinitis but also to improve the management of associated diseases. Several pharmacologic therapies can be considered in an armamentarium that includes antihistamines (intranasal and systemic), intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergic agents, intranasal steroids, systemic steroids, immunotherapy, and, most recently, leukotriene receptor antagonists. Often, combinations of these treatments are used to maximize control of refractory symptoms.

### Allergic rhinitis management pocket reference 2008 [^1143wjHT]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a major chronic respiratory disease because of its prevalence, impacts on quality of life and work/school performance, economic burden, and links with asthma. Family doctors (also known as 'primary care physicians' or 'general practitioners') play a major role in the management of allergic rhinitis as they make the diagnosis, start the treatment, give the relevant information, and monitor most of the patients. Disease management that follows evidence-based practice guidelines yields better patient results, but such guidelines are often complicated and may recommend the use of resources not available in the family practice setting. A joint expert panel of the World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca), the International Primary Care Airways Group (IPAG) and the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), offers support to family doctors worldwide by distilling the globally accepted, evidence-based recommendations from the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative into this brief reference guide. This guide provides tools intended to supplement a thorough history taking and the clinician's professional judgment in order to provide the best possible care for patients with allergic rhinitis. A diagnostic Questionnaire specifically focuses the physician's attention on key symptoms and markers of the disease. When questionnaire responses suggest a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, a Diagnosis Guide and a simple flowchart then lead the clinician through a series of investigations commonly available in primary care to support the diagnosis. In addition, key aspects of differential diagnosis are illuminated. According to ARIA, allergic rhinitis may be classified as Intermittent or Persistent, and as Mild or Moderate/Severe. The classification of rhinitis determines the treatment necessary, as set out in an ARIA flowchart included in this guide. The guide also includes information about the strength of evidence for efficacy of certain rhinitis treatments, a brief discussion of pediatric aspects, and a glossary of allergic rhinitis medications to assist the clinician in making medication choices for each individual patient. Finally, many patients with allergic rhinitis also have concomitant asthma, and this must be checked. The World Organization of Family Doctors has been delegated by WHO as the group that will be taking primary responsibility for education about chronic respiratory diseases among primary care physicians globally. This document will be a major resource in this educational program.

How AR can affect patients?

AR a common condition that affects > 20% of the UK population, is a frequent presenting problem in primary care, and is increasing in prevalence. It is associated with considerable morbidity; significantly reducing quality of life, interfering with attendance and performance at school and work, – and resulting in considerable health-care and indirect costs. – Around 50–80% of AR patients report that their condition interferes with sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, decreased alertness, inability to concentrate, depression and irritability. AR is also associated with a number of coexisting conditions, including asthma, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media with effusion and nasal polyposis.

### Management of acute rhinosinusitis in children [^115YYLTP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a common condition in children, usually preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Diagnosing ARS can be challenging, relying primarily on clinical history and examination. Differentiating between viral URTI, post-viral ARS and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is crucial for guiding appropriate antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics have been showed to be effective in improving symptom scores and cure rates in ABRS. Adjunct therapies, including corticosteroids, nasal saline irrigation and analgesics, may provide symptomatic relief. While viral ARS is self-limiting, bacterial ARS can lead to severe complications, including orbital and intracranial involvement, necessitating timely diagnosis and treatment. This review highlights current evidence on the diagnosis and management of ARS in children, emphasising best practices to optimise patient outcomes and prevent complications.

### Otolaryngologic management of chronic cough in school-aged children: a review [^116xcRkQ]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The causes of pediatric chronic cough are numerous and span across several medical subspecialties. In addition to the vast array of underlying causes, there are also several different ways to approach and evaluate chronic cough. Given the frequency with which children present to otolaryngology clinics with this problem, a review of common otolaryngologic causes and an algorithm for evaluation and treatment can be beneficial.

Observations

The primary 3 causes of pediatric chronic cough presenting to an otolaryngologist include infectious causes, reflux, and airway hyperreactivity. In these cases and other instances of specific cough, treatment should be directed at the underlying cause-which may include supportive care, antibiotics, antireflux medication, bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or other intervention. Patients with nonspecific cough should be treated according to pediatric-specific cough algorithms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Appropriate workup and treatment of chronic cough can lead to higher cure rates, shorter cough duration, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers. A systematic approach using cough algorithms can help otolaryngologists effectively manage this common yet complex problem.

Rhinosinusitis summary statements 40–47 — pediatric ARS/CRS management states: Realize that ARS in children is a self-limited process in most cases and treatment with antibiotics seems to accelerate resolution (Rec, A). Use an intranasal corticosteroid (INS) as a potentially useful adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of ABRS in children (StrRec, A). Realize that ancillary therapy in the form of nasal irrigations, antihistamines, decongestants, or mucolytics has not been shown to be helpful in the treatment of ARS in children (Opt, D). Realize that there are limited data to justify the use of oral antibiotics for the treatment of CRS in children (Opt, C). Consider use of antibiotic therapy in acute exacerbations of CRS in children (Rec, C). Use INS in the treatment of CRS in children (Rec, C). Realize that surgery is used much less frequently in the management of CRS in children compared with adults and that the mainstay of therapy is medical (Rec, C). Consider adenoidectomy with or without maxillary sinus irrigation as the first-line surgical therapy in children with CRS (Rec, C).

Saline irrigation in children with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — a randomized trial found no added benefit from gentamicin. In a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study of once-daily saline versus saline plus gentamicin for 6 weeks in 60 children, both groups had statistically significant improvements in quality-of-life at 3 weeks and CT scores at 6 weeks with no significant difference between groups, suggesting the addition of gentamicin provided no additional benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^116Cmejr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

### Cough [^117H4Xxr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Revisiting the safety of over-the-counter cough and cold medications in the pediatric population [^112i5hFt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Increased reports of serious adverse events in young children have led to numerous investigations of its therapeutic role in the pediatric population. A review of the literature has shown limited support of its use in young children, with the majority of randomized controlled trials showing no difference in endpoints when compared to placebo. Because of the recent recommended changes to pediatric cough and cold medication use, studies have suggested a decline in ingestion misuses, health care referrals, and reports of adverse events. While these patterns of use are reassuring, clinicians should continue to educate and provide caregivers guidance in managing cough and cold symptoms. Although a tremendous improvement in frequency of therapeutic error ingestions in children younger than 2 years was shown in these studies, the same magnitude of improvement was not seen in children 2 to 12 years. Therefore, future research is necessary to investigate its role in children younger than 12 years.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — hospitalized adults and pediatric predictors show variable accuracy and age-specific features. In hospitalized patients, fever with cough or sore throat had a sensitivity of 43% for patients without asthma and only 20% for asthmatic patients. Infants and young children with influenza may not always have fever and may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, may present with fever and suspected sepsis, and diarrhea can occur in up to 28% of infants and young children with influenza. In young children 1–5 years, fever > 38°C, chills, headache, malaise, and sore eyes were significantly associated with a positive RT-PCR test result. In pediatric patients, fever (≥ 38°C), headache, cough, and absence of abnormal breathing sounds had a positive predictive value of 57.1%. Among children aged ≤ 5 years, adding rhinorrhea to the fever and cough case definition achieved a better balance between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (47%), and among pediatric outpatients aged ≤ 13 years with respiratory infections, fever was the only reliable predictor of culture-confirmed influenza virus infection.

### Algorithm-based pediatric otolaryngology management during the COVID-19 global pandemic: a children's hospital of Philadelphia clinical consensus [^11317VEt]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires clinicians to explore alternatives to routine patient management. Otolaryngologists caring for children commonly depend on physical examination, laboratory data, and ambulatory surgical procedures. Limiting patient care, mindful allocation of resources, and concern for safety have challenged all aspects of our health care system. This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed literature, published reports, institutional guidelines, and expert consensus.

Review Methods

A clinical consensus on 6 common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology developed with evidence-based strategies.

Conclusions

Providers should suspend all in-person nonessential office visits and elective surgical procedures. An emphasis on medical management and caregiver education will provide reasonable approaches to many of the common outpatient concerns. Surgery for chronic otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute rhinosinusitis should occur only in response to severe complications or failure of medical regimens. The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling. Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures.

Implications For Practice

Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires thoughtful planning. The strategies described allow for safe handling of common pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses. Ultimately, otolaryngologists must be stewards of our global health community while advocating for the care of individual pediatric patients.

A child with persistent runny nose may cause significant parental anxiety and healthcare utilisation. While the most common diagnoses are recurrent acute viral upper respiratory tract infections and allergic rhinitis, a careful history and examination is necessary to exclude other causes and to identify comorbidities. Treatment can then be tailored to the underlying cause. The aim of this article is to provide a systematic approach to such patients.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

Immunotherapy must be given under physician's supervision. Sterile solutions, vials, syringes, etc. must be used. Aseptic technique must be observed in making dilutions from stock concentrates. The usual precautions in administering allergenic extracts are necessary, refer to boxed WARNINGS and "WARNINGS" section. Sterile syringe and needle must be used for each individual patient to prevent transmission of serum hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other infectious agents.

Epinephrine 1:1000 should be available. Refer to "OVERDOSAGE" section for description of treatment for anaphylactic reactions.

Information for Patients:

Patient should remain under observation of a nurse, physician, or personnel trained in emergency measures for at least 20 minutes following immunotherapy injection. Patient must be instructed to report any adverse reactions that occur within 24 hours after injection. Possible adverse reactions include unusual swelling and/or tenderness at injection site, rhinorrhea, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or faintness. Immediate medical attention must be sought for reactions that occur during or after leaving physician's office.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extract to determine their potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility.

CHEST Expert Panel — acute cough due to the common cold — issues ungraded consensus-based suggestions as follows: For adult and pediatric patients, "we suggest against the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients, "we suggest against the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years), "we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), with the remark that "Infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms". In pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), "we suggest avoiding use of codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^1113EnLY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Meningitis (bacterial or viral) — background notes that most types of bacterial meningitis do not spread easily from person-to-person, except two specific types that can be highly contagious: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis and Neisseria meningitidis meningitis (also called "meningococcal meningitis"); these bacteria can spread from person-to-person by inhaling or having direct contact with an infected person's respiratory tract secretions through coughing, kissing, and sneezing, and exposed contacts are sometimes given preventative antibiotics to prevent them from becoming sick. Recommendations state to allow individuals who were discharged from the hospital after treatment for bacterial meningitis to enter the family-centered residential facility; allow individuals who were exposed to a person with bacterial or viral meningitis who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility without restrictions and refer them to their primary care physician, licensed clinician or the public health department to determine if they qualify for post-exposure antibiotics to prevent the disease; allow individuals who are prescribed post-exposure antibiotics to enter the facility; if a guest develops symptoms of meningitis, immediately refer them for medical evaluation and notify the program manager if the person has Hib or meningococcal meningitis so exposed guests can be identified, notified, and instructed to contact their primary care physician, licensed clinician or public health authorities; and restrict entrance to the facility to individuals who have been discharged from the hospital after treatment for viral meningitis until they are fever-free for 24 hours and diarrhea (if present) has resolved completely.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^114VKUv8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS

The classic clinical course of pertussis occurs in three stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The initial catarrhal stage begins with nonspecific viral upper respiratory tract symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, sneezing, and mild dry cough) and lasts about 1–2 weeks before progressing to the paroxysmal stage. The paroxysmal stage is well‐known for the spasmodic, repetitive cough that occurs with the same breath and ends in an inspiratory whoop or gasp resulting from a breath taken against a swollen glottis. This stage is where the name "whooping cough" was derived from, and it is often associated with post‐tussive emesis and cyanosis. Following the paroxysmal stage is the convalescent stage, where individuals slowly improve over a few weeks to even months. Fever is generally not associated with pertussis, and the most common lab abnormality is lymphocytosis.

Pertussis can affect all ages, but the most severe presentation/course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, who account for most of the hospital admissions and deaths. Older children, adolescents, and adults tend to have a more varied presentation than the classic clinical course. Typically, symptoms consist of a mild respiratory illness; prolonged cough often prompts adults to seek care.

Pertussis can cause pulmonary, neurologic, and nutritional complications. Even with treatment with antibiotics, the course of serious illness with pertussis can be long and significant. Table 1 describes the clinical complications and frequency seen by age group. Approximately 50% of infants and 12% of adults with pertussis will require hospitalization. The paroxysmal cough can be associated with cyanosis, vomiting, and bradycardia. Pneumonia is a common complication due to the lungs becoming filled with inflammatory cells and fibrous material. Pulmonary hypertension can also result from the formation of lymphocyte aggregates in the setting of lymphocytosis, leading to an increase in pulmonary vasculature. Encephalopathy can result from hypoxia/apneic episodes that occur during paroxysmal coughing episodes. Patients can also develop intracranial bleeding or new onset seizures. Nutritional complications result from difficulty eating or recurrent vomiting with the paroxysmal cough. In adults, prolonged and intense coughing can lead to pulled muscles, broken ribs, pneumothorax, temporary urinary incontinence, and syncope. Additional complications that have been reported are subcutaneous emphysema, umbilical and inguinal hernias, subconjunctival hemorrhages, otitis media, insomnia, carotid artery dissection, and death.

### Chronic sinusitis in children [^115tJ7HH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute sinusitis in children have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Of note is that in this document, a brief discussion of chronic disease concluded that the pathogenesis and management are essentially unknown. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines, a careful review of the literature and clinical experience of experts who manage pediatric chronic sinusitis is presented in an effort to develop specific recommendations and to offer practical treatment options. Factors associated with chronic sinusitis should be addressed individually and include recurrent viral upper respiratory infections, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, and anatomic abnormalities. Bacteriology includes the 3 pathogens associated with acute disease i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis but with chronic sinusitis also includes Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Medical interventions discussed include endoscopic sinus surgery, saline nasal irrigation, intranasal decongestant therapy, intranasal steroids, and oral antibiotics. Clinical ranking without regard to side effects and cost suggests that endoscopic sinus surgery and antral irrigation have the highest probability of substantial symptom improvement. Other issues discussed include identification and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergy, and immune deficiency.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to further establish the efficacy and safety of once-daily FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg in Chinese pediatric patients aged 2–12 years, with additional subgroup analysis of the 2–6-year age group.

This study met its primary efficacy endpoint: a statistically significant greater treatment effect was observed in the mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS compared with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg compared with placebo, in both the ITT population and the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, over 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. FFNS treatment at both doses also demonstrated efficacy in managing other AR symptoms within the ITT population. Over 4 weeks, FFNS 110 µg demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in daily rTOSS compared with placebo, and a significant reduction in anterior rhinoscopic findings (assessing the nasal mucosa, secretory volume, and description of rhinorrhea) was associated with FFNS irrespective of dose throughout the treatment period. The observed increase in the number of days without use of loratadine rescue medication for patients on active FFNS treatment also reflects the reduction in symptoms achieved in the ITT population. Generally, results were similar between the ITT population and the pre-specified younger subgroup of patients aged 2–6 years.
