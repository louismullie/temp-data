## Question

Surgical be non surgical hip reduction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about surgical versus non-surgical hip reduction across conditions, with transparent reasoning and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical contexts where "hip reduction" applies. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence for each context, including randomized and high-quality guideline data. Next, I will examine outcomes, risks, and patient selection nuances. After that, I should synthesize condition-specific recommendations and highlight evidence gaps. Finally, I will translate this into practical decision-making guidance and a concise conclusion, ensuring I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts encompassed by "hip reduction". Initially, I thought this might only refer to acute fracture-dislocation reduction, but wait, let me verify the broader indications: developmental dysplasia of the hip (closed versus open reduction), femoral neck fractures (internal fixation versus arthroplasty), acetabular fractures, and even osteoarthritis where "reduction" is metaphorical for symptom control versus arthroplasty; I should also consider pediatric SCFE and nonarthritic hip pain with impingement where joint-preserving surgery is sometimes pursued after failed conservative care, so I need to keep these distinct buckets in mind to avoid conflating mechanisms and outcomes.

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and grading approach to anchor strength of recommendations. Hold on, I should verify that the VA/DoD and AAOS frameworks use GRADE-based methods and explicit strength ratings; yes, both employ GRADE to assess certainty of evidence and assign "strong" versus "weak" recommendations based on balance of benefits and harms, confidence in evidence, and values/preferences, which will guide how confidently I can state conclusions for each condition [^117SbWd2] [^111Hduo4] [^1149wVdE].

> For developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants, I will now examine non-surgical versus surgical reduction. Let me think about the natural history and spontaneous resolution; I should confirm that many neonatal hip abnormalities resolve without intervention, which tempers early aggressive treatment. The Cochrane review of splinting in infants under 6 months shows very low certainty evidence and no clear superiority of immediate dynamic splinting over delayed strategies for stable or dislocatable hips, supporting a watchful approach in selected cases. But wait, what if the hip is dislocated or unstable? POSNA-aligned guidance supports closed reduction when instability persists, and contemporary series suggest closed reduction achieves high initial success with meaningful AVN risk, while open reduction carries higher AVN rates; importantly, age at intervention matters, with earlier treatment reducing the need for secondary surgery, so I should not understate the value of timely action when instability is present [^116yanh9] [^117PVEHR] [^11431s3B] [^117FZfEV] [^111Ytcsv].

> For adult hip fractures, I need to check whether non-operative care is ever appropriate and how outcomes compare. The Cochrane review indicates that operative management shortens hospital stay and improves rehabilitation versus conservative care, though mortality differences are inconsistent across small RCTs; contemporary large-scale observational syntheses show non-operative management is selected in roughly 8–10% of cases globally, with higher mortality and worse functional outcomes, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is confounded by indication, as "too unwell" patients are overrepresented in non-operative cohorts. Guidelines endorse surgery for most, reserving non-operative care for patients with prohibitive risk or aligned goals of care, and emphasize early mobilization and orthogeriatric models to mitigate complications, so I should frame non-operative care as exceptional rather than routine [^112cMRp9] [^1146wZnM] [^113m6Xx1] [^116Gu4Yk].

> For osteoarthritis, I should confirm the sequencing of non-surgical care before arthroplasty. The VA/DoD guideline prioritizes exercise therapy, weight loss, and NSAIDs as first-line, with opioids only as a last resort given small benefits and substantial harms; platelet-rich plasma shows mixed and generally low-certainty signals for hip OA, so I should avoid overstating its role. Shared decision-making is essential, and when pain and function remain unacceptable despite appropriate non-operative therapy, elective total hip arthroplasty is appropriate; the AAHKS/ACR guideline advises not to delay arthroplasty unnecessarily after a reasonable non-operative trial, which I should integrate into timing discussions [^114Vn2CN] [^1163C3kU] [^116fWkSw] [^1112EtFK] [^114jhpTq].

> For acetabular fractures, let me consider when non-operative management is reasonable. I should double-check that small, minimally displaced, stable patterns in low-demand patients may do well with non-operative care, whereas displaced, unstable patterns or those with intra-articular fragments generally benefit from surgical reduction and fixation; surgical hip dislocation can facilitate anatomic reduction in complex cases, but the learning curve is steep and evidence is largely retrospective, so patient selection and surgeon expertise are pivotal [^111SgZoe].

> For nonarthritic hip pain, including femoroacetabular impingement, I need to ensure I distinguish early disease from advanced OA. High-quality RCTs show non-operative care can yield meaningful short-term improvements in many patients with FAI and mild OA, but outcomes wane in the presence of Tönnis grade 2 or higher degeneration, where arthroscopy may underperform and conversion to arthroplasty is common; thus, I should confirm radiographic stage and counsel that joint-preserving surgery is less predictable in moderate-to-advanced OA, reinforcing a non-operative first approach in early disease [^1118WRiz] [^114CUuEx].

> Now, I should synthesize cross-cutting principles. First, age and biology drive thresholds: infants with unstable DDH benefit from timely closed reduction, older adults with fragility fractures benefit from operative fixation to enable mobilization, and adults with end-stage OA benefit from timely arthroplasty after failed conservative care. Second, evidence quality varies: DDH and some trauma domains rely on observational data with low certainty, whereas OA guidelines have stronger RCT foundations; I need to be transparent about this uncertainty. Third, shared decision-making is non-negotiable, integrating patient values, comorbidities, and functional goals, especially when evidence is weak or trade-offs are stark [^116ymHSU].

> But wait, what about specific outcomes and risks I must flag? For DDH, AVN risk after closed reduction is variably reported and influenced by definitions and follow-up, so I should communicate a realistic range and the potential need for secondary procedures. For hip fractures, non-operative care is associated with higher mortality and worse function, though confounded, so I should avoid implying equivalence. For OA, I should caution that opioids offer small, short-term benefits with nontrivial harms, and that PRP evidence for the hip remains limited and inconsistent, preventing strong endorsement [^117FZfEV] [^1146wZnM] [^116fWkSw] [^1112EtFK].

> I should also identify evidence gaps and research directions. Large, pragmatic trials comparing high-quality non-operative pathways versus surgery in specific DDH phenotypes are needed; randomized or rigorously adjusted studies of non-operative fracture care in the highest-risk cohorts could clarify selection; and head-to-head trials of exercise, weight loss, NSAIDs, and intra-articular therapies with adequate follow-up would refine OA sequencing, particularly in hip-dominant disease where knee-focused data dominate [^116yanh9] [^113m6Xx1] [^117T6zZi].

> Translating this into practice, I need to ensure condition-specific algorithms are explicit. For infants with DDH, start with observation or Pavlik harness for stable dysplasia, escalate to closed reduction with spica for instability, and reserve open reduction for failed closed methods or older infants, counseling on AVN and the importance of timely intervention. For older adults with hip fracture, default to surgical fixation or arthroplasty with rapid mobilization, reserving non-operative care for those with overwhelming risk or palliative goals. For OA, exhaust exercise, weight loss, and NSAIDs, avoid routine opioids, and proceed to arthroplasty when pain and function remain unacceptable, avoiding unnecessary delays once a non-operative trial is complete [^11431s3B] [^112X1VKK] [^114Vn2CN] [^114jhpTq].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no universal answer to surgical versus non-surgical hip "reduction"; decisions must be condition-specific, evidence-weighted, and patient-centered. Non-surgical care is appropriate first-line for many infants with DDH and for adults with early OA or selected low-demand fracture patterns, whereas surgery is preferred for unstable DDH, most hip fractures, and advanced OA with refractory symptoms, with shared decision-making guiding exceptions and trade-offs in the face of uncertainty [^116yanh9] [^112cMRp9] [^114Vn2CN] [^114jhpTq].

Surgical hip reduction is indicated for **displaced femoral neck fractures** [^113tShxe], **unstable acetabular fractures** [^111SgZoe], and **failed closed reduction** in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) [^1172Bp2X], as it provides **anatomical alignment**, **stable fixation**, and **early mobilization** to reduce complications and improve outcomes [^112cMRp9]. Non-surgical management is reserved for **stable, impacted fractures** [^112X1VKK], **high-risk patients** with severe comorbidities [^117EFUTg], or **infants with mild DDH** [^116yanh9], where closed reduction and bracing can be effective [^117GzivG]. The choice depends on fracture type, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each approach [^112X1VKK].

---

## Indications for surgical hip reduction

Surgical hip reduction is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Displaced femoral neck fractures**: Surgical reduction and internal fixation or arthroplasty are recommended for displaced femoral neck fractures to restore joint congruity and function [^113tShxe].

- **Unstable acetabular fractures**: Surgical reduction is indicated for unstable acetabular fractures to achieve anatomical reduction and stable fixation, preventing post-traumatic arthritis and joint dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Failed closed reduction in DDH**: Open reduction is indicated when closed reduction fails or is not feasible, particularly in older infants or those with complex dislocations [^116SuGL9].

---

## Indications for non-surgical hip reduction

Non-surgical hip reduction is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Stable, impacted fractures**: Non-displaced or stable impacted femoral neck fractures may be managed conservatively with traction and immobilization, particularly in patients with high surgical risk [^112X1VKK].

- **High-risk patients**: Patients with severe comorbidities or poor physiological reserve may benefit from non-surgical management to avoid perioperative complications [^notfound].

- **Infants with mild DDH**: Closed reduction with bracing (e.g. Pavlik harness) is effective for infants with mild developmental dysplasia of the hip, particularly when initiated early [^notfound].

---

## Comparative outcomes and complications

| **Aspect** | **Surgical reduction** | **Non-surgical reduction** |
|-|-|-|
| Advantages | - Anatomical alignment <br/> - Stable fixation <br/> - Early mobilization <br/> - Reduced risk of non-union and avascular necrosis [^notfound] | - Avoids surgical risks <br/> - Lower infection rates <br/> - Suitable for high-risk patients [^115U1vHa] |
| Disadvantages | - Surgical risks (infection, bleeding, anesthesia complications) <br/> - Higher cost <br/> - Longer recovery in some cases [^notfound] | - Prolonged immobilization <br/> - Higher risk of non-union <br/> - Avascular necrosis <br/> - Persistent pain and functional impairment [^notfound] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

- **Age**: Younger patients generally tolerate surgery better and have better functional outcomes, while older patients may benefit from non-surgical management due to higher surgical risks [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with significant comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or osteoporosis, may be better suited for non-surgical management [^115U1vHa].

- **Fracture type and severity**: Displaced, unstable, or complex fractures typically require surgical reduction, whereas stable, minimally displaced fractures may be managed non-surgically [^112X1VKK].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values, expectations, and lifestyle [^114jhpTq].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on patient-specific factors, fracture type, and available resources. The AAOS recommends surgical reduction for displaced femoral neck fractures [^113tShxe] and unstable acetabular fractures, while non-surgical management is reserved for stable, minimally displaced fractures or high-risk patients [^112X1VKK]. For DDH, early closed reduction with bracing is recommended, with open reduction reserved for failed closed reduction or older infants [^11431s3B].

---

## Conclusion

Surgical and non-surgical **hip reduction** have distinct indications, advantages, and disadvantages. Surgical reduction is preferred for **displaced or unstable fractures** and **failed closed reduction**, providing anatomical alignment and stable fixation, whereas non-surgical management is suitable for stable fractures, high-risk patients, or infants with mild DDH. The decision should be individualized, considering patient-specific factors, fracture characteristics, and current clinical guidelines.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) — the Work Group used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation, using four domains: balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, confidence in the quality of the evidence, patient or provider values and preferences, and other implications (resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation ("Strong" or "Weak"), and generally a "Strong" recommendation indicates high confidence in the quality of the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications.

### Conservative versus operative treatment for hip fractures in adults [^112cMRp9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Until operative treatment involving the use of various implants was introduced in the 1950s, hip fractures were managed using conservative methods based on traction and bed rest.

Objectives

To compare conservative with operative treatment for fractures of the proximal femur (hip) in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008), Current Controlled Trials, orthopaedic journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing these two treatment methods in adults with hip fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by fracture type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped by implant type and data were pooled where appropriate using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

The five randomised trials included in the review involved only 428 elderly patients. One small and potentially biased trial of 23 patients with undisplaced intracapsular fracture showed a reduced risk of non-union for those fractures treated operatively. The four trials on extracapsular fractures tested a variety of surgical techniques and implant devices and only one trial involving 106 patients can be considered to test current practice. In this trial, no differences were found in medical complications, mortality and long-term pain. However, operative treatment was more likely to result in the fracture healing without leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay and a statistically non-significant increase in the return of patients back to their original residence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is a lack of available evidence to inform practice for undisplaced intracapsular fractures, variation in practice has reduced and most fractures are treated surgically. The limited available evidence from randomised trials does not suggest major differences in outcome between conservative and operative management programmes for extracapsular femoral fractures, but operative treatment is associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. Conservative treatment will be acceptable where modern surgical facilities are unavailable, and will result in a reduction in complications associated with surgery, but rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity more common. Currently, it is difficult to conceive circumstances in which future trials would be practical or viable.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116fWkSw]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — opioid therapy recommendations and evidence: An RCT found no significant differences between etoricoxib and tapentadol in pain reduction or physical function at 12 weeks, with adverse events 49% versus 37% (p = 0.048, favoring tapentadol). The guideline notes that the current VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain "recommends against initiating long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain", that "Alternatives to opioid therapy… are the mainstay of management", and that "non-opioids are recommended over opioids". For patients who "do not have an adequate response to several non-pharmacologic and non-opioid therapies" and have "persistent, severe OA pain", a cautious, patient-centered opioid therapy approach "may be considered" for "carefully selected patients in which the benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks", and if opioids are prescribed, "it should be for the shortest duration and at the lowest effective dose" with "appropriate monitoring as per the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy is suggested". The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was "very low" and trials were short-term "1–17 weeks"; because of serious opioid risks, the Work Group concluded risks outweighed potential benefits, while benefits included "a modest reduction in pain intensity and improved function" that "have not been studied over the long-term and are likely not clinically significant". The Work Group acknowledged opioids "may be considered for certain patients" and issued a "Weak against" recommendation.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — weight loss and pain outcomes: Percent weight loss with interventions ranged from 4.5–11.4% versus 1.3–4.3% for comparators, with a weighted effect size of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.17–0.48) based on four articles (n = 676), and larger effect sizes in studies achieving > 10% weight loss. In overweight and obese patients, diet and exercise interventions reduced pain up to 12 months (mean BMI ranged from 32.8–37.9 kg/m²), with mean weight loss 4.7%, and authors estimated at least 6–8% weight loss may be required for pain improvement; a smaller multifactorial randomized controlled trial reported improvement in pain and greater weight loss versus control. For diet-only interventions, seven RCTs up to 72 weeks were not associated with a statistically significant impact on pain, despite mean weight loss of 10.5%; however, a smaller RCT (n = 62) with a three-month follow-up found a statistically significant improvement in pain with diet versus control with an average weight loss of 1.7 kg (2%).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^114FeAN5]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — evidence limitations and practical considerations note serious inconsistency and imprecision with study designs and outcomes, with concerns about blinding, incomplete outcome data collection, selective reporting, other biases, and unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, plus a lack of hip OA studies, limited evidence for severe knee OA, lack of radiographic outcomes, and no studies comparing interventions with CSI. Given the novelty of this treatment, some variation in patient preference is likely, and many patients still prefer exhausting all non-invasive options; stem cell therapy is relatively expensive, currently not covered by insurers, and requires additional resources (e.g., centrifuge, technician training, increased procedural time), including for bone-marrow-derived approaches an additional, moderately invasive iliac crest harvesting procedure with image guidance, time, support staff, and some minor procedural discomfort. As a Reviewed, New-added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, that stem cell therapy may not be a recommended treatment option among older adult patients who have severe and/or advanced OA, and that the benefits (i.e., pain reduction, improved function, quality of life) and the potential for some minor change in disease progression were balanced with the risks.

### Common elective orthopaedic procedures and their clinical effectiveness: umbrella review of level 1 evidence [^116hRzKE]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Explanations for findings

Surgery is expensive and associated with considerable morbidity, increased risk of complications attributed to the surgical intervention, and excess mortality. Seeking high level evidence to support surgery is thus imperative. When high level evidence shows that non-operative care is equivalent, surgeons and patients should carefully consider what would be achieved by doing surgery. A cogent argument can be made for surgery being used as a second line treatment when non-surgical measures have failed or in certain subgroups of patients who have been identified as "responders" to surgical treatment. However, trials first need to be done to show the efficacy of surgery in these scenarios and to define the period of treatment with non-surgical interventions that is appropriate before surgery is undertaken. For an operation such as total hip replacement, the understandable assumption is made that all improvement is due to the surgery, but some may be due to the natural history including regression to the mean or treatment effect from non-replacement co-interventions. Given the current waiting lists for surgery due to the covid-19 pandemic, a randomised controlled trial comparing total hip replacement with best non-surgical care may be timely, especially if those patients randomised to non-operative care are subsequently offered surgery should they be dissatisfied with the outcome of non-operative care.

Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes — definition and guiding questions — focuses on the size of anticipated benefits relative to harms, and "the certainty or uncertainty of the provider about the risk-benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation". Key questions include whether "the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa", whether "Are the undesirable anticipated effects small?" and whether "Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects?"

### Surgical approaches and ancillary techniques for internal fixation of intracapsular proximal femoral fractures [^115netZj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In the fixation of intracapsular hip fractures, different implants, surgical approaches and ancillary manoeuvres have been employed to improve the reduction, and the stability of the reconstruction, in an attempt to reduce the frequency of non-union and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head.

Objectives

To compare alternative surgical approaches and ancillary techniques in internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures which have been subjected to randomised and quasi-randomised trials in adults.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Date of the most recent search: November 2004.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials investigating operative technique for the treatment of intracapsular hip fractures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality, by use of a 10 item checklist, and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial with 103 participants studied the effect of impaction of the fracture at the time of surgery. The only outcome measure reported was bone scintimetry. There was some evidence that impaction, particularly of displaced fractures, resulted in a reduction of blood flow to the femoral head as assessed by bone scintimetry. One quasi-randomised trial with 220 participants compared compression of the fracture with no compression. Results for 156 individuals at one year showed a tendency to a lower incidence of non-union for those fractures treated without compression. Two trials, one involving 102 young adults under 50 years old and the other involving 49 older people aged 65 years or over, compared open versus closed reduction of the fracture. Both found open reduction significantly increased length of surgery. None of the other differences between open and closed reduction in the outcomes reported by the two trials were statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists from randomised trials to confirm the relative effects of open versus closed reduction of intracapsular fractures, or the effects of intra-operative impaction or compression of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis — platelet-rich plasma (PRP) versus hyaluronic acid (HA), sham saline, CSI, and rehabilitation evidence from randomized controlled trials is as follows: Four RCTs suggest PRP leads to improved function at six and 12 months. Against HA, evidence from nine RCTs and five additional RCTs suggests there were no serious adverse events reported and no differences between PRP and HA, with mild injection-site adverse events noted 3–5 days post-procedure for both groups. Imaging outcomes versus HA were mixed: one RCT suggests no difference in MRI-evaluated progression at 12 months, another RCT suggests a significant difference in the proportion improving > 1 KLGS grade favoring PRP at six months, and another suggests significantly more ultrasound-detected improvements with PRP at both three and six months. Versus sham saline injection in knee osteoarthritis, three RCTs suggest PRP leads to significant differences in pain reduction at 3, 6, and 12 months and significant differences in improved function at 3, 6, and 12 months, with no serious adverse events reported. Versus CSI, five RCTs were inconsistent for pain reduction and improved function at 2, 3, and 6 months, and these RCTs suggest there were no serious or minor adverse events reported. Versus rehabilitation interventions, RCTs were inconsistent for pain reduction at two and three months, suggested PRP does not lead to functional differences at two and three months, and reported no serious adverse events but increased minor adverse events in the PRP group. Most studies were conducted in Europe, the Middle East, and China, and across studies there was significant heterogeneity in the preparation, dose, and frequency of injection administration for both PRP and the comparators of HA, CSI, and rehabilitation.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^115RTrmG]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery is generally the preferred treatment for fragility hip fractures in the older person. The surgical technique is well‐defined according to fracture type, and the beneficial role of early mobilisation and orthogeriatric models of care is well‐recognised. The evidence in favour of surgery does not come from randomised clinical trials but from consensus‐driven change in practice and a recognition of the poor outcomes in the past of those patients managed non‐operatively or who underwent delayed surgery. People presenting with hip fracture are at high risk of poor outcomes due to pre‐existing comorbidities, advanced age and frailty, and there is limited evidence to guide when non‐operative management should be considered and what the outcomes are following non‐operative management in contemporary practice. Recent work from our group has suggested that there is significant variation globally in attitudes and practice towards non‐operative management of hip fracture.

Our objective was to review the published literature systematically to describe: the variation in rates of non‐operative management of hip fracture across the world; the differences in admission characteristics between the non‐operative and operative populations; the outcomes associated with non‐operative compared with operative management; and the evidence gaps in known outcomes. Our focus was as much on describing the variation as on providing point estimates of particular characteristics.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^1146wZnM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Introduction

Surgery is the preferred treatment for hip fracture in older people. However, a proportion of patients with hip fracture do not receive surgery. There is a lack of contemporary evidence describing this patient population and what their associated outcomes are. We aimed to describe the variation in non‐operative management and its outcomes around the world.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of older people presenting to hospital with hip fracture, comparing those with and without surgery for non‐operative proportions, mortality and other outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale. We performed a random effects meta‐analysis with adjustment for clustering.

Results

Of 4437 screened studies, 185 were included from 172 separate cohorts, 44 countries, six continents and involving 10,763,994 patients. The overall proportion of non‐operative management was 8.4% (95%CI 7.2–9.7%) with wide within‐country and regional variation. There was no consistent association of non‐operative management proportions with the admission characteristics of sex, fracture type or patient ethnicity. Non‐operative management was associated with a greater relative risk of death at all time points. Risk of bias was generally low except for the expected confounding by indication.

Discussion

Non‐operative management of hip fracture is relatively common, but there is wide variation that is unexplained by differences in patient characteristics. The evidence is limited by incomplete reporting of patient characteristics and outcomes, and a lack of controlled studies even in the highest risk populations. Further work is needed to understand this decision‐making process.

VA/DoD knee osteoarthritis — PRP comparative evidence: For knee OA, the systematic evidence review found studies comparing PRP to HA, sham saline injection, CSI, and rehabilitation modalities, and produced one SR of 15 trials and seven additional RCTs comparing PRP to HA. Evidence from four RCTs in the SR conducted by Han et al. (2019) and two additional RCTs suggest that PRP leads to no difference in pain reduction relative to HA at three months, whereas evidence from five RCTs in the SR by Han et al. (2019) and three additional RCTs suggest statistically significant pain reduction favoring PRP at six and 12 months.

Our appraisal of 84 articles of non-randomised studies (n = 46) and randomised controlled trials (n = 38) that assessed four orthopaedic interventions (total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty carried out by a minimally invasive approach or computer assisted navigation system) does not support the hypothesis that, in general, results of non-randomised studies have better applicability than those of randomised controlled trials. The reporting of items judged "essential" for determining applicability did not differ between the two study designs. Important components of the intervention itself, such as protocols for preoperative care or management of pain, were rarely described. The proxy used to evaluate the applicability related to the context of care — the number of surgeons and centres — was similar between the trial types as well. Other factors potentially affecting actual applicability, such as the relevance of a radiographic primary outcome and duration of follow-up of less than one year, also did not differ by study design and limited the applicability of the results of the selected studies. Our results suggest that some reports of both non-randomised studies and randomised controlled trials may be of uncertain value to surgeons, researchers, systematic reviewers, and decision makers.

These results inevitably prompt the question of why. Controlled studies in other healthcare specialties vary on a spectrum of "pragmatism" or "efficacy/effectiveness", addressing research questions focused on clinical or policy decisions or mechanisms of action. Are our findings evidence of general disinterest among surgeons about pragmatic questions or were the interventions reviewed here too new? Some examples of nationally representative studies on surgical outcomes, such as those involving national arthroplasty registers, may provide useful data, but such studies make up a tiny fraction of the surgical literature. In fact, no published articles evaluating the selected procedures used data from a national register or similar database with wide coverage. Furthermore, studies carried out in other specialties highlight the challenges of interpreting the findings of non-randomised studies involving a nationally representative sample.

How could we improve the situation? Applicability must be considered as it is usually done for internal validity at different steps of the trial: in the protocol, when deciding the eligibility criteria for the centres, surgeons, and patients but also when reporting the trial results by following the CONSORT statement, particularly the extension for non-pharmacological treatments. To tackle the question of the impact of the surgical learning curve, for instance, one author recommended that "surgical trials should report explicitly and informatively on the prior expertise of the participating surgeons".

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^114CUuEx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — surgical candidacy after unsuccessful nonsurgical care notes that if symptoms do not improve with nonsurgical care, surgical intervention may be considered, but the literature is limited primarily to observational studies with small sample sizes and short-term outcomes and careful patient selection is needed if surgery is contemplated to optimize the potential for a favorable outcome.

### Hip fractures in the non-elderly-who, why and whither? [^115c7SzE]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Nonelderly hip fracture patients have gathered little scientific attention, and our understanding of the group may be biased by patient case-mix and lack of follow-up. Preconceptions may thwart adequate investigation of bone health and other comorbidities. This literature review focusses on who these patients between 20 and 60 years are, how to treat them and how to evaluate the outcome. 2–11% of the hip fractures occur in non-elderly, equally common in men and women. Every second to forth patient smoke, have chronic diseases, and abuse alcohol. Poor self-rated health, sleep disturbances, low cognitive function and education are associated with increased hip fracture risk in young adults. Bone health is poorly investigated, but literature suggest young patients to have lower bone mineral density regardless of trauma mechanism. Studies contradict on whether surgery within 8–12 h reduce the risk of avascular necrosis in femoral neck fractures (FNF). Based on rationality, surgery ought to be performed promptly, in order to reduce pain and permit rehabilitation. There is no convincing support from the existing literature to use open reduction. Good reduction is mandatory, preferably using a closed reduction technique. The failure rate following internal fixation of displaced FNF in younger patients can be as high as 59%. In some cases a displaced FNF is better treated with a primary arthroplasty; in case of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis for example. Complications after extracapsular fractures vary from 6 to 23%. The relatively few studies looking at functional outcome in non-elderly use a multitude of outcome measures, precluding comparisons. Many non-elderly patients seem not to fully recover. While some non-elderly hip fracture patients are healthy individuals sustaining high energy trauma, others have low-energy fractures and comorbidities including reduced bone strength (either as a primary or secondary condition). i.e. non-delaying medical optimization, proper surgical technique, bone health investigation and secondary fracture prevention is necessary. Younger hip fracture patients are at risk of permanent loss of function, and negative socioeconomic and psychological consequences. High-energy trauma does not exclude the presence of osteopenia. A hip fracture in adulthood and middle-age is very seldom caused by bad luck only!

VA/DoD hip osteoarthritis — PRP versus HA evidence: The systematic evidence review produced one SR comparing PRP to HA for hip OA, and there is limited research on the use of PRP in hip OA. An SR by Ye et al. (2018) included four trials comparing PRP to HA and found that PRP leads to statistically significant reductions in pain compared to HA at two months but not at six and 12 months; the clinical relevance of this statistically significant difference is unclear. The SR found no difference in function between PRP and HA at all follow-up periods and no difference in safety between PRP and HA for nausea and infection, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was downgraded given problems with blinding and ITT analyses, and the Work Group agreed that the benefits and harms/burden of PRP were generally balanced.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1163C3kU]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — clinical summary and recommendation state that the evidence supports a clinically significant reduction in pain with NSAIDs and a lesser overall effect of reducing pain with acetaminophen in patients with OA of the hip or knee; the superiority of NSAIDs over acetaminophen was more apparent in patients with moderate-to-severe baseline pain, while differences were negligible in milder disease or symptoms. Therefore, providers should carefully consider the medical history of patients being considered for such therapy, and providers should avoid offering this treatment to patients with comorbidities that increase their risk for adverse events (e.g. CKD [chronic kidney disease], especially severe CKD, at risk for or known CVD, at risk for NSAID-related upper GI events). Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen appear to be dose-related, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and avoidance of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is suggested in patients with certain comorbidities, leading to a "Weak for" recommendation.

### The optimal age for surgical management of DDH differs by treatment method [^111Ytcsv]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of consensus on the optimal age for specific surgical interventions for developmental dysplasia of the hip. We compared radiographic and clinical outcomes among patients who were treated with closed reduction (CR), open reduction (OR), and open reduction with concomitant pelvic osteotomy (ORP) for the treatment of a dislocated hip. We sought to identify the optimal age at treatment within each of these groups.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 256 hips (n = 195 patients) who underwent CR (n = 96), OR (n = 116), or an ORP (n = 44) as their index procedure at a single institution between January 1, 2004 and September 23, 2020. Radiographic outcomes included acetabular index, The International Hip Dysplasia Institute classification, and acetabular depth ratio. The incidence of further corrective surgery (FCS), defined as the need for an additional femoral and/or pelvic osteotomy before skeletal maturity, and the optimal age cutoffs for index surgery within each surgical group were determined.

Results

After adjusting for age and sex, the incidence of FCS was 13.8% in the CR group, 29.2% in the OR group, and 9.2% in the ORP group. Earlier surgery was protective against FCS in the CR and OR groups. In contrast, patients in the ORP group who were older at index procedure were less likely to undergo FCS. Optimal age at surgery was 9.9 months (CR), 11.5 months (OR), and 21.4 months (ORP). Compared with older patients, younger patients were associated with a larger average decrease in the acetabular index and a larger average increase in acetabular width during the first 5 years post surgery.

Conclusions

Age at index surgical procedure was correlated with both clinical and radiographic outcomes. Age at index procedure did impact the risk of subsequent FCS, particularly in the CR and ORP groups. Based on our analysis, CR should be considered before 9.9 months of age and OR considered before 11.5 months of age to minimize the risk of FCS during childhood. This work highlights the importance of considering age-related heterogeneity in developmental dysplasia of the hip treatment outcomes.

### Femoral head injuries: which treatment strategy can be recommended? [^114BcLDw]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Despite different operative and non-operative treatment regimens, the outcome after femoral head fractures has changed little over the past decades. The initial trauma itself as well as secondary changes such as posttraumatic osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis or heterotopic ossification is often responsible for severe loss of function of the afflicted hip joint. Anatomic reduction of all fracture fragments seems to be a major influencing factor in determining the outcome quality. Eight years ago we inaugurated a new surgical approach for better access and visualisation for the treatment of femoral head fractures, using the "trochanteric flip" (digastric) osteotomy. Thus inspection of the entire hip joint and accurate fragment reduction under direct visual control are possible. After good initial experiences with this operative procedure we changed our standard treatment regimen to this approach in an attempt to achieve the most accurate anatomic reduction of the femoral head in every affected patient. Between 1998 and 2006 we operated on 12 patients with femoral head fractures associated with posterior hip dislocation, using the new surgical approach. Patients were followed for 2–96 months and outcome was documented with the Merle d'Aubigne and Postel score as well as the Thompson and Epstein score. The posttraumatic formation of heterotopic bone was documented with the Brooker score. Retrospective analysis of these 12 patients showed good or excellent results in 10 patients (83.3%). The two patients with poor outcome developed an avascular necrosis of the femoral head and underwent total hip arthroplasty. Periarticular heterotopic ossification was seen in five patients. In four patients this caused a significantly reduced range of motion and was therefore considered as a posttraumatic complication. The two patients with the most severe heterotopic bone formation (Brooker III and IV) had initially sustained multiple injuries including brain injury. Comparing our results with earlier published series including our own before changing the treatment protocol, the data suggest a favorable outcome in patients with trochanteric flip (digastric) osteotomy for the treatment of femoral head fractures.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^113aVFv9]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis. Minor changes to the pre‐registered protocol included: a decision to limit included references/reports to those with mid‐cohort date after 1995 (to describe more contemporary practice); exclusion of studies reporting comparisons of management approaches for impacted intracapsular fractures (not the population of interest); and exclusion of COVID‐19‐related studies (non‐representative of general practice and reported widely elsewhere). This study has been reported in line with PRISMA recommendations.

We primarily searched PubMed and Web of Science (online Supporting Information Appendix S1). These searches were supplemented with specific searches for reports from hip fracture registries, keyword searching within Google Scholar and Google, snowballing forwards (citing references within PubMed and Google Scholar) and backwards (manual review of reference lists). The primary search was carried out in February 2024; updates were carried out, including snowballing, in June 2024 and October 2024.

Inclusion criteria were: study population of patients with fragility hip fracture requiring hospital care (as defined by the author or clearly corresponding to international definitions); and comparative data for both operative and non‐operative patients for at least one characteristic, including their respective numbers or proportions. Key exclusion criteria were: studies before 1995; studies investigating surgical approaches to impacted intracapsular hip fracture; and COVID‐19‐related studies. There was no restriction by country, study type (trials, observational studies) fracture type or publication language. We did not attempt to assess rates of non‐operative management formally across whole populations.

Search results were de‐duplicated using a combination of automated matching and manual verification. All screening, abstract, full paper review, quality assessment and data entry were performed independently by two study authors, with resolution of differences by discussion and/or correction from original data. We used Rayyan (Rayyan Systems Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA) for study screening and deduplication; Covidence (Covidence, Melbourne, Australia) for full text review; and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) for data collation.

### Splinting for the non-operative management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in children under six months of age [^116yanh9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) describes the abnormal development of a hip in childhood, ranging from complete dislocation of the hip joint to subtle immaturity of a hip that is enlocated and stable within the socket. DDH occurs in around 10 per 1000 live births, though only one per 1000 are completely dislocated. There is variation in treatment pathways for DDH, which differs between hospitals and even between clinicians within the same hospital. The variation is related to the severity of dysplasia that is believed to require treatment, and the techniques used to treat dysplasia.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of splinting and the optimal treatment strategy for the non-operative management of DDH in babies under six months of age.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other electronic databases, and two trials registers up to November 2021. We also checked reference lists, contacted study authors, and handsearched relevant meetings abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-RCTs, as well as non-RCTs and cohort studies conducted after 1980 were included. Participants were babies with all severities of DDH who were under six months of age. Interventions included dynamic splints, static splints or double nappies (diapers), compared to no splinting or delayed splinting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and performed risk of bias and GRADE assessments. The primary outcomes were: measurement of acetabular index at years one, two and five, as determined by radiographs (angle): the need for operative intervention to achieve reduction and to address dysplasia; and complications. We also investigated other outcomes highlighted by parents as important, including the bond between parent and child and the ability of mothers to breastfeed.

Main Results

We included six RCTs or quasi-RCTs (576 babies). These were supported by 16 non-RCTs (8237 babies). Five studies had non-commercial funding, three studies stated 'no funding' and 14 studies did not state funding source. The RCTs were generally at unclear risk of bias, although we judged three RCTs to be at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. The non-RCTs were of moderate and critical risk of bias. We did not undertake meta-analysis due to methodological and clinical differences between studies; instead, we have summarised the results narratively. Dynamic splinting versus delayed or no splinting Four RCTs and nine non-RCTs compared immediate dynamic splinting and delayed dynamic splinting or no splinting. Of the RCTs, two considered stable hips and one considered unstable (dislocatable) hips and one jointly considered unstable and stable hips. No studies considered only dislocated hips. Two RCTs (265 babies, very low-certainty evidence) reported acetabular index at one year amongst stable or dislocatable hips. Both studies found there may be no evidence of a difference in splinting stable hips at first diagnosis compared to a strategy of active surveillance: one reported a mean difference (MD) of 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.74 to 0.94), and the other an MD of 0.20 (95% CI -1.65 to 2.05). Two RCTs of stable hips (181 babies, very low-certainty evidence) reported there may be no evidence of a difference between groups for acetabular index at two years: one study reported an MD of -1.90 (95% CI -4.76 to 0.96), and another study reported an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -1.93 to 1.73), but did not take into account hips from the same child. No study reported data at five years. Four RCTs (434 babies, very low-certainty evidence) reported the need for surgical intervention. Three studies reported that no surgical interventions occurred. In the remaining study, two babies in the dynamic splinting group developed instability and were subsequently treated surgically. This study did not explicitly state if this treatment was to achieve concentric reduction or address residual dysplasia. Three RCTs (390 babies, very low-certainty evidence) reported no complications (avascular necrosis and femoral nerve palsy). Dynamic splinting versus static splinting One RCT and five non-RCTs compared dynamic versus static splinting. The RCT (118 hips) reported no occurrences of avascular necrosis (very low-certainty evidence) and did not report radiological outcomes or need for operative intervention. One quasi-RCT compared double nappies versus delayed or no splinting but reported no outcomes of interest. Other comparisons No RCTs compared static splinting versus delayed or no splinting or staged weaning versus immediate removal.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of RCT evidence for splinting for the non-operative management of DDH: we included only six RCTs with 576 babies. Moreover, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, precluding meta-analysis. We judged the RCT evidence for all primary outcomes as being of very low certainty, meaning we are very uncertain about the true effects. Results from individual studies provide limited evidence of intervention effects on different severities of DDH. Amongst stable dysplastic hips, there was no evidence to suggest that treatment at any stage expedited the development of the acetabulum. For dislocatable hips, a delay in treatment onset to six weeks does not appear to result in any evidence of a difference in the development of the acetabulum at one year or increased risk of surgery. However, delayed splinting may reduce the number of babies requiring treatment with a harness. No RCTs compared static splinting with delayed or no splinting, staged weaning versus immediate removal or double nappies versus delayed or no splinting. There were few operative interventions or complications amongst the RCTs and the non-randomised studies. There's no apparent signal to indicate a higher frequency of either outcome in either intervention group. Given the frequency of this disease, and the fact that many countries undertake mandatory DDH screening, there is a clear need to develop an evidence-based pathway for treatment. Particular uncertainties requiring future research are the effectiveness of splinting amongst stable dysplastic hips, the optimal timing for the onset of splinting, the optimal type of splint to use and the need for 'weaning of splints'. Only once a robust pathway for treatment is established, can we properly assess the cost-effectiveness of screening interventions for DDH.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^111YjvsP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical course and surgical considerations — total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the most common surgical procedure for end-stage hip OA, yet consensus on criteria for the timing of surgery has not been established. The Group for the Respect of Ethics and Excellence in Science (GREES) suggests that nonsurgical intervention has failed if a patient has not experienced a reduction in symptoms, such as a 20% to 25% improvement on the WOMAC pain subscale, and has progressive loss of joint space of between 0.3 and 0.7 mm per year. The rate of hip OA progression varies from patient to patient; therapists should monitor the clinical course of hip OA (range of motion [ROM] and strength) and baseline hip pain, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades, joint space width, and outcome score. In a secondary analysis of 131 patients meeting American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for hip OA, investigators were unable to identify variables that predicted treatment success for patients with hip OA, and independent variables included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), duration of symptoms, comorbidities, treatment adherence, baseline pain with activity, baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function subscale score, baseline Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score, baseline aggregate range of motion (ROM), and treatment adherence.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical management of acetabular fractures with associated patterns in elderly patients: factors affecting outcomes [^1153bo8E]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Other limitations exist within this study. We are not able to remark on the quality of reduction as a possible contributing factor for PTA and poor outcomes. In addition, there was a low response rate (31%) for completion of the MFA. When comparing outcomes across treatments, it was difficult to draw concrete conclusions due to the small response rate in the nonsurgical group. This was due to either lack of interest, inaccurate phone numbers or address, or death of the patient. The low response rate among the nonsurgical group may also portend a bias toward sampling patients with worse outcomes secondary to lower satisfaction with recovery. Finally, although the MFA survey is a measure of outcome, it fails to consider certain factors such as patient outlook and baseline function. Other measures of functional outcome and quality of life could be analyzed, such as the Short Form-36. Further study to include more individuals through more years or at more centers would increase validity. Prospective MFA completion during follow-ups would also be informative.

### Variation in treatment of hip fractures and guideline adherence amongst surgeons with different training backgrounds in the Netherlands [^112DpU2C]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Two medical specialties, general surgery and orthopaedic surgery, with different training programs but matching trauma certification requirements, provide hip fracture surgery in the Netherlands. This study analyses treatment preferences and guideline adherence of Dutch surgeons with different surgical backgrounds.

Patients and Methods

All hip fracture patients registered in the Dutch Hip Fracture Audit in 2018 and 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Four types of surgeons were distinguished: trauma-certified general surgeons (ST+), non-trauma certified general surgeons (ST-), trauma-certified orthopaedic surgeons (OT+) and non-trauma certified orthopaedic surgeons (OT-). Differences in patient characteristics, and practice variation in treatment choices and guideline adherence per fracture type were analysed using descriptive statistics.

Results

28,656 patients were included; 16,367 (57.1%) treated by ST+, 1,371 (4.8%) by ST-, 4,692 (16.4%) by OT+ and 6,226 (21.7%) by OT-. Few clinically relevant differences in patient characteristics and hospital processes were found between all surgeon groups. Displaced FNF were the most commonly treated fracture type for all types of surgeons. Both OT+ and OT- operated mostly (displaced) FNFs, while the fracture types treated by ST+ and ST- were more heterogeneous. For all fracture types, the orthopaedic surgeons performed THA and HA more often than general surgeons, while general surgeons more often placed SHS and IMN for specific fracture types. Guideline adherence was on average 68.4% and differed significantly per surgeon type (68.7% by ST+, 65.2% by ST-, 74.4% by OT+ and 63.6% by OT- (p < 0.01)), as well as per fracture type: > 90% treatment according to the guideline for trochanteric AO-31A2 and A3 fractures, 18.8% for AO-31A1 fractures and 51.7% guideline adherence for undisplaced FNF. Guideline adherence for displaced FNF varied depending on patient characteristics.

Discussion

In the Netherlands, different surgical specialists treat different types of hip fractures and have different preferences concerning implants for hip fracture surgery in comparable patients. Guideline adherence of trauma- and non-trauma certified orthopaedics and general surgeons differs significantly. Reduction of practice variation should be strived for in order to improve hip fracture care.

### What is the best evidence for the treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis? [^114h3xMZ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are many different treatment methods for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). It was the purpose of this study to review the results from the literature for different methods of SCFE treatment and on the basis of level of evidence determine the current best evidence treatment.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Treatment results were grouped into 2 categories. The first was all methods without surgical hip dislocation, and the second was all methods in which surgical dislocation was used.

Results

For stable SCFEs without surgical dislocation, the best recommended treatment (mostly level IV) recommends in situ single screw fixation over multiple pin fixation, epiphysiodesis, osteotomy, or spica cast. For the unstable SCFEs without surgical dislocation (all level IV), the best recommended treatment is urgent reduction with decompression and internal fixation. For both stable and unstable SCFEs, the short-term small series in the literature (all level IV) does not demonstrate an advantage or improvement in outcomes compared with in situ single screw fixation for stable SCFE and urgent reduction, decompression, and internal fixation in unstable SCFEs.

Conclusions

A systematic review of the literature recommends on the basis of level of evidence that the best treatment for a stable SCFE is single screw in situ fixation and for unstable SCFEs urgent gentle reduction, decompression, and internal fixation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^115tS5U2]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — opioid efficacy versus placebo notes that most opioids consistently reduced pain intensity more than placebo, but the effect sizes were relatively small for knee osteoarthritis (SMD: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.41 – -0.04), hip osteoarthritis (SMD: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.93 – - 0.28), and combined knee and hip osteoarthritis (SMD: -0.29, 95% CI: -0.38 – -0.20). While opioid treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity, the reduction did not reach the benchmark for clinical significance set by da Costa et al. (2014) (SMD: 0.37, corresponding to 0.9 centimeters [cm] reduction on a 10 cm VAS). Treatment with all opioids, except for tapentadol, also improved physical function more than placebo, but these improvements were relatively small.

NSAID and acetaminophen effectiveness with minimally important difference (MID) — a systematic review by da Costa et al. (2017) (n = 58,451; 76 trials) found that all active treatments improved pain associated with OA of the hip or knee versus placebo, but not all treatments met the predefined MID to be clinically significant. Interventions meeting MID criteria were rofecoxib 25–50 mg, etoricoxib 30–90 mg, and diclofenac 150 mg, with only diclofenac available in the U.S., and the maximum daily doses of naproxen and ibuprofen had an estimated 80% probability of meeting the MID for pain reduction.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — comparisons of tramadol with acetaminophen and NSAIDs report that an RCT comparing tramadol to acetaminophen showed no statistically significant differences in pain reduction or study withdrawal due to adverse events at seven days. Trials comparing NSAIDs (diclofenac, celecoxib) to tramadol at four and 12 weeks found NSAIDs reduced pain (SMD: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07–0.36) and improved function (SMD: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.37) over tramadol; tramadol was associated with more adverse events and more study withdrawals than NSAIDs, although there was no difference in serious adverse events. RCTs comparing the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen versus NSAIDs alone found no statistically significant difference in pain reduction between groups at 8–12 weeks.

### Palliative care in the hip fracture patient [^117EFUTg]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline through PubMed to look for all relevant articles discussing the use of nonoperative management when compared to surgery in patients with hip fracture between 1985 and 2016. Search terms included: palliative care, conservative care, non-operative, hip fracture, orthopedic procedures, fracture fixation, and surgery (see Figure 1 for search strategy). The search returned 374 articles and was narrowed using English language and aged 65+ years as limits, leaving 142 articles. Articles were hand searched for relevance to hip fractures in the elderly patients, patient postoperative outcomes, pre- and postoperative mortality risks, and the role of different medical specialties in the treatment of fractures. Articles were first screened by title and abstract and then by full text. Specific terminology included in hand searching were nonoperative hip fracture, conservative management of hip fracture, nonoperative management of hip fracture, differences in mortality conservative versus operative, and care planning. Exclusion criteria included articles primarily covering surgical management, fractures in areas other than the hip, or fractures in the pediatric or adult populations. Articles were also excluded if surgical fixation was provided before palliative care, an amputation was performed, or in cases of malignancy.

Type of exercise in hip and knee osteoarthritis — comparative evidence shows no superiority among modalities while multiple approaches are effective. The Work Group determined that various exercise therapy approaches are effective for the management of OA of the hip and knee; however, there was insufficient evidence to recommend one specific type of exercise therapy over any other type for the management of hip or knee OA. For knee OA, a systematic review of aquatic versus land-based exercise that included eight RCTs found no statistically significant differences in reducing pain or improving physical function, quality of life, or symptoms. Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 19 RCTs indicated both land-based and water-based exercise programs were superior to a control intervention for pain relief in the short-term (< 3 months) but indicated no statistically significant differences between different types of exercise therapy. Individual randomized controlled trials were consistent: an RCT of 64 patients comparing sensory-motor training to resistance training showed statistically significant reductions in pain and improved function in both groups with no statistically significant differences between the two groups; an RCT among 100 patients comparing neuromuscular exercise with quadriceps strengthening found significant reductions in pain and improvements in physical function in both groups with no statistically significant between-group differences; and an RCT of 39 patients comparing quadriceps strengthening on a vibration platform (whole-body vibration) to quadriceps strengthening alone found no statistically significant differences in pain or physical function measured at 16 weeks.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis — weight management and exercise — Providers should refer to the current VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Adult Overweight and Obesity for current evidence-based weight reduction recommendations. Previously published guidelines have established that weight reduction is a cornerstone of non-pharmacologic therapy for the management of hip and/or knee OA, and high-level arthroplasty studies have shown that elevated BMI, in particular BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², is an independent risk factor for developing post-operative peri-prosthetic joint infections. Some patients and providers believe exercise may exacerbate symptoms of OA despite the longstanding recommendation of exercise as one of the core elements in a comprehensive treatment plan.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants — observational and case control evidence describes that intervention with splintage devices, more frequent visits to providers, and increased imaging occur where DDH is diagnosed, and that treatment has been associated with varying rates of avascular necrosis representing a possibility of harm. For children who present at walking age or older, these studies suggest a greater risk of being managed by open surgical hip reduction with attendant risks of avascular necrosis, infection, hip stiffness, and early onset osteoarthritis as an adult. The harms of late diagnosis with no treatment are not established. The guideline scope is limited to children up to six months of age.

### The management of developmental dysplasia of the hip in children aged under three months: a consensus study from the British society for children's orthopaedic surgery [^114iiiEb]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Delphi process on the management of DDH in children aged under three months revealed some agreement, in an area of medicine with a long history of debate and varied practice. Consensus was reached in 42 of 60 statements proposed by clinicians, with clarity given to the perceived optimal methods of screening and treatment for DDH. It is important to note that none of the areas of consensus are based on high-quality evidence and require focused research. Nevertheless, in the context of uncertainty, consensus is a useful basis on which guidelines can be standardized and a foundation from which evidence can be formulated.

A key difference in this study, compared with most international guidelines, -,- was that consensus recommended a universal USS strategy. This is in line with some European practice, and a previous European DDH consensus group which reported in 2019. Undoubtedly the reason behind this outcome is the high number of children in whom the diagnosis of DDH continues to be missed in the UK, and therefore present late and require surgical treatment. Most respondents were surgeons who deal with these missed cases. A further key outcome is the appetite for high-quality research to address the uncertainties. The evidence base in children's orthopaedics has been strengthened by recent successful national cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. - The enthusiasm of the clinical community, combined with new tools that allow the extensive collection of outcome data such as Smart4NIPE, could enable large studies to be efficiently undertaken throughout the UK. It is clear that while interventions for screening need to be tested, elements of the treatment pathway such as how, when, and who to treat, appear the highest priorities. Only by understanding the fundamental aspects of the condition and effective forms of treatments can we begin to understand the place of screening.

### Closed reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip: early-term results from a prospective, multicenter cohort [^117FZfEV]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis is one of the most concerning complications following CR. In recent studies (published since 2000), the incidence of AVN following CR varies widely between 2% and 36%,–with Cooper et alnoting that this disparity is "largely caused by differences in the definitions of AVN and the timing of follow-up". Comparing closed versus open treatment, Novais et alreported in their recent meta-analysis an incidence of significant AVN (grade ≥ 2) of 8% following CR versus 19% following OR, with Clarke et alreporting a similar pattern of 7% and 14%, respectively. Here, our reported incidence of AVN was 25% at a median follow-up of approximately 2 years. Although some have suggested that prolonged follow-up for 10 to 12 years is necessary to ascertain the true incidence of AVN, others argue that follow-up beyond 2 years will not identify additional cases.–A variety of classification criteria have also been used, and many authors differentially include low-grade changes. This variation in AVN definitions and lengths of follow-up highlight the importance of establishing a prospective cohort that can be followed longitudinally to determine accurate data.

Young femoral neck fractures remain challenging fractures to treat. Reduction has repeatedly been shown to be the single most important determinant of patient outcome, and treating surgeons should do all they can to achieve anatomic reduction because this is an outcome variable within the surgeon's control.

In addition, we hope to review indications and techniques for using the various treatment implants/modalities that are currently available as they pertain to reduction and fixation.

VA/DoD hip & knee osteoarthritis — topical NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) efficacy and safety: Diclofenac is the only commercially manufactured topical NSAID currently available in the U.S., and trials found topical diclofenac to be superior to placebo and equivalent to oral diclofenac at reducing pain associated with OA of the knee, with another RCT showing no significant difference between topical and oral diclofenac; diclofenac gel provided statistically significant pain relief over placebo and vehicle control. Studies with topical ketoprofen and topical piroxicam compared to oral NSAIDs showed no significant difference in pain reduction, and topical NSAIDs showed indirect superiority over oral acetaminophen, opioids, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, although these agents have not been compared in head-to-head trials. Treatment with topical NSAIDs was associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events but more local adverse events compared to oral NSAIDs; safety data are mostly limited to 12-week follow-up, two open-label studies showed the safety profile of topical diclofenac at one year to be consistent with results at 12 weeks, and the systematic evidence review yielded no studies evaluating the effect of topical NSAIDs on pain associated with OA of the hip.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^113m6Xx1]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The key findings of our systematic review were: rates of and outcomes following non‐operative management of hip fracture vary across the world; despite non‐operative management being reported for around 1 in 12 patients, there is a paucity of data on who these people are; and there are large gaps in our understanding of what outcomes are for these patients, particularly for those who survive.

To our knowledge, this is the largest collation of data pertaining to non‐operative management of hip fracture. Three previous reviews identified only a total of 22 studies. We cast a wide net deliberately, rather than narrowing our search to trials or matched cohort studies. We set out to describe variation in practice as much as deriving point estimates. Confounding by indication is universal to all the data we have reported; hence, interpreting outcomes of those with and without surgery is not straightforward. Any discussion of the point estimates we have generated must acknowledge the high degree of heterogeneity between reports and their clinical contexts. Although we have provided region‐level summary estimates, even those cover widely different healthcare systems and cultural approaches.

The variation in the use of non‐operative management of hip fracture between continents, countries and even within countries is significant (e.g. National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), Spanish Hip Fracture Registry and Australia and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR)) and is unlikely to be explained by differences in the patient populations. Our previous work suggests that there are regional and cultural differences in non‐operative decision‐making and pathophysiological reasons are clearly a part of this. However, although the average age of patients managed non‐operatively was greater than those undergoing surgery, the difference was relatively small (2–2.5 years) and there was no association between the average age of the cohorts and proportions with non‐operative management. Similarly, although other surrogates of frailty such as independence in mobility and activities of daily living were suggestive of people living with greater degrees of frailty having non‐operative management, the data do not support this as a strong differentiator. The reasons why non‐operative management was chosen were frequently not reported or simply described in terms akin to 'too unwell'. However, we suggest that it is likely the clinician‐patient‐family interpretation of the patient's current state and future outcomes influences this decision more than differences in the health of the patients presenting with hip fracture.

### Indications and clinical results of non-operative management of periprosthetic hip fractures in elderly patients [^115U1vHa]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The increase in life expectancy in the general population has led to a rise in the use of hip arthroplasties and consequently, to an increase in the incidence of periprosthetic hip fractures (PPHF). The impact of this type of fracture on patients necessitates a personalized approach to treatment, whether surgical or non-operative, taking into account the trajectory and associated comorbidities.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 80 patients over the age of 70 diagnosed with a periprosthetic hip fracture between 2011 and 2018. These cases were reviewed after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. We included demographic data, comorbidities including Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), primary prosthesis characteristics, fracture type according to the Vancouver classification, treatment received and mortality among others. Radiographs were analyzed during follow-up and Merle D'Aubigné and visual analog scales were performed.

Results

Fifty-two of the 80 fractures analyzed involved total hip arthroplasties, 26 were hemiartroplasties and only 2 were revision prostheses. A total of 77.5% had cementless stems and 88.8% of the patients had significant comorbidities. There were 29 B1 (36.3%) and 30 B2 (37.5%) fractures which compromised most of the study cohort. Fifty-three patients underwent surgery compared to 27 patients (34%) treated non-operatively; most of the latter had short, oblique undisplaced B1 fractures. 28 fractures (35%) required reduction and fixation (ORIF) while 25 patients (31.3%) underwent a revision arthroplasty (RA). The mean score at 3 months for the VAS scale was 2.9 points and for Merle D'Aubigné scale, the scores were 4.3 points for pain, 4.1 for mobility and 3.8 for ambulation. Seven patients who underwent surgery died in the first 2 months compared to 2 in the non-operative group. Revision arthroplasty had the highest prevalence of mortality (p = 0.032) as did those with a CCI ≥ 6 (p = 0.038).

Conclusions

In some low functional demand elderly patients with significant comorbidities non-operative treatment can be considered, especially in fractures with short transverse and oblique patterns where it provides similar clinical and radiographic results to surgical treatment whilst avoiding additional risks in these fragile and vulnerable patients.

Acetaminophen — hip and knee osteoarthritis efficacy: In systematic reviews (SRs) and network meta-analyses, acetaminophen versus placebo showed clinically insignificant differences in reducing pain and improving function in osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and/or knee, and there was not a dose-dependent effect; in one analysis, maximal doses 3,900–4,000 milligrams [mg]/day produced statistical improvement, but differences were not clinically significant regardless of dose. In another SR and network meta-analysis, the relative reduction in OA pain from baseline was 32.5% for acetaminophen, while other classes reduced pain to a greater degree (NSAIDs = 34.3%, p = 0.035; opioids [mostly tramadol] = 35.4%, p = 0.001; COX-2 inhibitors = 36.9%, p < 0.001; topical NSAIDs [knee and hand only] = 40.9%, p < 0.001).

Exercise therapy overall effects and implementation — All forms of exercise therapy reviewed appear to show significant improvements in pain and function at short-term follow-up; therefore, the Work Group could not recommend a specific type of exercise therapy over another, and the magnitude of exercise's effect appears to lessen in long-term comparisons; exercise needs to be ongoing for sustained improvements, as strength and function will decline back to baseline if exercise is stopped; the Work Group determined the benefits and harms were balanced because no specific exercise therapy appeared to be more or less beneficial, or more or less harmful, than another; shared decision making is important to develop an individualized program that is feasible for a patient's current functional level, with feasibility depending on availability of equipment, space, training, or staff, and providers must weigh economic burdens such as lost wages, transportation costs, and co-pays.

### Applicability and generalisability of published results of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies evaluating four orthopaedic procedures: methodological systematic review [^116UVp53]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We identified and selected eligible published articles of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies that assessed four surgical procedures: minimally invasive and computer assisted navigation techniques for total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Next, we surveyed orthopaedic surgeons to identify items considered essential in assessing the applicability of evidence for these procedures to clinical practice. We extracted data on the reporting of essential applicability items using standardised methods and compared the quality of reporting for non-randomised studies and randomised controlled trials. Finally, we extracted data on the context of care (number of centres and surgeons involved) and compared the applicability of the context of care for non-randomised studies and randomised controlled trials.

Search for and selection of eligible studies

We searched for all English language articles of trials that evaluated minimally invasive or computer assisted total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty in Medline and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (see web extra appendix 1 for details of the search strategy). One author (LP) screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations to select the relevant articles. The a priori inclusion criteria were all randomised and non-randomised studies that compared total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty done by a minimally invasive approach or a computer assisted navigation system with one or more conventional procedures. We also included trials that evaluated minimally invasive procedures involving computer assisted navigation techniques.

A priori exclusion criteria were uncontrolled studies, non-therapeutic studies (in vitro, biomechanical, and epidemiological studies), pathophysiological studies, letters, ancillary studies such as a subgroup analysis, studies that compared two minimally invasive procedures or two computer assisted navigation procedures, cost effectiveness evaluations, and systematic reviews or meta-analyses. We also excluded studies that assessed the organisation of the healthcare system or interventions provided to care providers. When more than one article was retrieved for the same study, we considered only the earliest publication as eligible.

We used a standardised form to extract data for each eligible study (see web extra appendix 2): year of publication, type of surgical procedure (total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty, minimally invasive or navigation procedure), study design (randomised controlled trial, non-randomised historically controlled study, case-control study, or other non-randomised comparative study), sample size, whether a statistician or methodologist was included among the authors, the risk of bias, and items essential to interpreting the applicability of the findings.

Categorizing recommendations without an updated review of the evidence in the VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis clinical practice guideline (CPG) specifies that, for recommendations carried forward with a review of the evidence and slightly modified wording, the "Reviewed, Amended" category was used, and recommendations not brought forward after review were designated "Reviewed, Deleted". When recommendations were carried forward from the previous version without an updated systematic review (SR), these were categorized as "Not reviewed"; if evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as "Not changed", "Amended", or "Deleted". "Not reviewed, Not changed" refers to recommendations carried forward unchanged, "Not reviewed, Amended" designated recommendations modified from the 2014 VA/DoD OA CPG with the updated GRADE language, and "Not reviewed, Deleted" applied if they were determined to be out of scope (topics outside the scope for the updated CPG as defined by the Work Group). Because the 2014 recommendations inherently needed to be modified at least slightly to include this language, the "Not changed" category was not used, and the categories for the recommendations included in the 2020 version of the guideline are noted in the Recommendations, with the 2014 categories noted in Appendix D.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis evidence review methodology — key questions (KQs), PICOTS, and outcome rating: The CPG Champions and Work Group identified KQs to guide the systematic evidence review on the non-surgical management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), and the KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions. As a result of resource constraints, not all developed KQs were included; the Champions and Work Group included questions of highest priority. Once the KQs were finalized, the Work Group prioritized the outcomes for each KQ by importance to decision making and, using GRADE methodology, rated each outcome on a 1–9 scale (7–9, critical for decision making; 4–6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1–3, of limited importance for decision making), and only critical outcomes were used to determine the overall quality of evidence.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^114wYdyq]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. Despite a comprehensive search, we may have missed some reports; but additional data are unlikely to alter our key findings. Many of the studies reported non‐operative management as a byline of people not included in a study of postoperative outcomes, hence the lack of detailed information about the patients. There may be smaller studies that by chance had zero non‐operative management rates but did not report this explicitly, so were not captured in our searches. However, the lack of difference between data solely from administrative and registry‐based studies and results from all the cohorts would suggest the impact of this is small. We have undertaken extensive sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of outliers and there are no meaningful differences in results. Importantly, these data are not from randomised trials. We do not believe the data support a particular optimal proportion of non‐operative management. Personal and societal attitudes towards quantity and quality of life and ageing will differ. We do suggest, however, that there is unexplained and probably unwarranted variation.

Moving forward, we suggest that there are practical steps that may improve our understanding and practice in this area. The Fragility Fracture Network and individual registries could consider explicit inclusion of data fields related to characteristics and outcomes of those having non‐operative management. There is opportunity for national, regional and international consensus on the principles of decision‐making and pathways of care for those offered or receiving non‐operative management. We would suggest that these discussions must include patients and their carers, wider society and regulatory authorities. We must avoid any retreat into a nihilistic view of hip fracture management in general, which is rightly predicated on offering surgery to the vast majority of patients.

Bar the FRAIL‐Hip studies, there were few data on what non‐operative care looked like. In settings where non‐operative management is more common, we would suggest that this pathway is similar in quality to an operative pathway. There is scope for carefully considered research in this area which might include: identifying patients where non‐operative management may be the preferred option for them and their carers, either before or after fracture; understanding the reasons for inter‐individual, inter‐hospital and national variation; identifying optimal approaches to palliation in those who are dying; and rehabilitation in those where operative management is viewed as riskier than not operating.

### The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in neuromuscular hip reconstruction: can we alter the need for blood transfusion? [^1119mmfH]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with neuromuscular complex chronic conditions (NMCCC) frequently undergo hip reconstruction surgery requiring blood transfusion. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirement in NMCCC children undergoing hip reconstruction surgery.

Methods

Children with NMCCC undergoing hip reconstruction surgery between 2013 and 2018 were identified. Two cohorts were identified: those who received TXA and those who did not. Patient and surgical characteristics between cohorts were used for propensity matching. Patients were matched on the basis of comorbid factors, bilateral involvement, pelvic osteotomy, open reduction, and surgeon. Comparative outcomes between cohorts were analyzed for intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements and length of hospital stay (LOS).

Results

A total of 166 patients underwent hip surgery at an average of 9.6 years (SD, 4.0). Propensity matching utilized 72% of the cohort including 47 TXA and 72 non-TXA subjects. There were no differences in patient or surgical characteristics across matched groups. Fifteen (15/47, 32%) TXA subjects required a postoperative blood transfusion compared with the 47% (34/72) of non-TXA subjects who required a transfusion and intraoperative transfusion rates were similar between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in complication rate (TXA, 79%; non-TXA, 86%), reported estimated blood loss (median = 200mLfor both) or LOS (median = 6d for both). Hematocrit levels were slightly higher in TXA subjects intraoperatively (P = 0.047), at the end of surgery (P = 0.04), and for the overall lowest perioperative level (P = 0.04). The overall percent loss of estimated blood volume was less for those who were given TXA compared with those who were not (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of TXA during hip reconstruction surgery in NMCCC children significantly reduced the percent loss of estimated blood volume and postoperative transfusion rate. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed to verify the positive effects and safety of TXA in the setting of hip reconstruction surgery in NMCCC children.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^1116XS7J]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) research needs — framing priorities for detection and nonoperative management — highlight defining core concepts and standardizing measures. Listed needs include specifying "clinical terms that describe hip stability", articulating "radiographic and ultrasound criteria for dysplasia and dislocation based upon age", identifying "historical and clinical risk factors to be assessed for all children that are related to DDH", clarifying "what constitutes "standard" brace treatment of DDH", and stating "what are outcomes criteria that define successful or failed treatment for DDH". Methodologic priorities call to "establish universally accepted and reproducible ranges of normal values across ages for sonographic and/or radiographic hip measures or any future surrogates for normal hip development", "establish clear relationships between these surrogates for hip development and demonstrate long-term functional limitations that are correlated to surrogate values that fall outside of the normal ranges", "define the benefits and harms of late diagnosis of DDH", "define the harms of early diagnosis and treatment of DDH", "standardize follow-up times after bracing to improve objective testing of outcomes", and "provide research design that is applicable to routine practice situations and allows for comparison of alternative methods of diagnosis and treatment".

### Minimally invasive versus classic procedures in total hip arthroplasty: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^117GRtkW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

After the introduction of MIS (incision length 10–12 cm or less) in THA, a debate started worldwide regarding the possible clinical benefits of this approach as compared with the classic approaches (CLASS). The rationale for MIS is a minimized tissue dissection, resulting in reduced blood loss, pain, hospital stay, and faster rehabilitation. Compared with the classic approach, the first retrospective studies showed a greater perioperative complication rate in the absence of clinical improvements in the THAs performed with a posterolateral MIS approach. Randomized trials showed conflicting results. However, these nonblinded studies suffered from selection, confirmation, and personal bias. Dorr et al. performed the first double-blind, randomized controlled trial using a sham-incision strategy. Because of the relatively small study population, the possible benefits of MIS over the classic approach could not be established.

To contribute to a better understanding of the effects of this minimally invasive THA on clinical and other parameters, we conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We attempted to eliminate bias by blinding investigators and patients from group allocation by using a sham-incision strategy. In this study we compared the MIS and CLASS approaches with regard to the following five issues: (1) Can a clinically significant difference in clinical outcome between these two approaches be detected at 6 weeks and 1 year after surgery? (2) Does MIS result in a greater incidence of complications than CLASS? (3) Is there a difference between approaches in perioperative factors such as operative time, blood loss, or tissue injury? (4) Is there a difference between approaches in thigh circumference and body mass index (BMI) for the perioperative and clinical outcomes? (5) Are there differences between groups with respect to the radiographic measures?

### Use of inlet radiographs in the assessment of reduction after the surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip [^111bs2oq]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

This pilot study aimed to evaluate prospectively the use of inlet radiographs of the hip as an alternative method of the assessment of reduction after the surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).

Patients and Methods

The children in this study underwent surgery between January 2013 and January 2015. All had inlet radiographs and CT scans post-operatively. Data were analysed by determining inter-observer reliability and intra-observer reproducibility, using the kappa value (K). Differences were settled by discussion between the two observers until a consensus was reached. The sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic and CT results were compared. A total of 26 radiographs were obtained from 23 children, with a mean age of 2.38 years (one to five).

Results

Similar high levels of intra- and inter-observer agreement were observed (K = 0.834, 95% confidence interval (CI)). There was a high agreement between the radiographic and CT results (K = 0.834, 5% CI), with excellent sensitivity and a specificity of 95.5%.

Conclusion

These results suggest that inlet radiographs may be a reliable method of assessing the reduction of the hip after the surgical treatment of DDH. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:697–701.

### Intravenous tranexamic acid decreases blood transfusions and blood loss for patients with surgically treated hip fractures [^115N3Gfn]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Distribution of Surgical Techniques.

For statistical analysis, rates of blood transfusion were calculated for those patients who received TXA and those who did not, which are the control event rate and experimental event rate. The absolute risk reduction was then calculated and then converted to a number needed to treat (NNT). From this data, the relative risk reduction was calculated. As the blood transfusion results data is dichotomous or non-continuous, so a 95% Confidence Interval for the difference between 2 independent proportions was calculated. Additionally, a 2×2 Chi Square analysis was performed with significance set to P < .05. The calculated blood loss, using the hemoglobin balance method, for each patient was recorded. The mean blood loss and standard deviation for each group was calculated. Using this information, the 95% CI for single samples was calculated using the Z statistic. Since these data were continuous, an unpaired 2 tailed t-test was utilized. Significant was set to P < .05. Microsoft Excel was used for some calculations. Online statistical calculators were used for other tests. The 95% Confidence Interval for the difference between 2 independent proportions was accessed at. Chi square analysis calculator was accessed at. The Z statistic calculator was accessed at. The unpaired 2 tailed t-test calculator was accessed at.

### Developmental dysplasia of the hip [^1172Bp2X]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatricians are often the first to identify developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and direct subsequent appropriate treatment. The general treatment principle of DDH is to obtain and maintain a concentric reduction of the femoral head in the acetabulum. Achieving this goal can range from less-invasive bracing treatments to more-invasive surgical treatment depending on the age and complexity of the dysplasia. In this review, we summarize the current trends and treatment principles in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH.

### Does perfusion MRI after closed reduction of developmental dysplasia of the hip reduce the incidence of avascular necrosis? [^113qpmZ9]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gadolinium-enhanced perfusion MRI (pMRI) after closed reduction/spica casting for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) has been suggested as a potential means to identify and avoid avascular necrosis (AVN). To date, however, no study has evaluated the effectiveness of pMRI in clinical practice or compared it with other approaches (such as postreduction CT scan) to show a difference in the proportion of AVN.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Can a pMRI-based protocol be used immediately post closed reduction to minimize the risk that AVN would develop? (2) What are the overall hip-related outcomes after closed reduction/spica casting using this protocol? (3) Do any patient-specific factors at the time of closed reduction predict future AVN?

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study at a large tertiary care children's hospital. Between 2009 and 2013 we treated 43 patients with closed reduction/spica casting for DDH, of whom 33 (77%) received a postreduction pMRI. All patients were indicated for pMRI per treating surgeon preference. A convenience sample totaling 25 hips in 22 patients treated with pMRI was then established using the following exclusion criteria: DDH of neuromuscular/syndromic origin, failed initial closed reduction, less than 1 year of clinical and radiographic followup, and subsequent open reduction. Next, the 40 patients treated with closed reduction between 2004 and 2009 were screened until the chronologically most recent 25 hips (after applying the previously mentioned exclusion criteria) were identified in 21 of the first 34 patients (62%) screened. Although termed the CT group, specific postreduction imaging was not a defined inclusion criterion in this group with the majority (21 of 25 [84%]) receiving postreduction CT and the remainder (four of 25 [16%]) receiving only postreduction radiographs. All hips with globally decreased femoral head perfusion on postreduction pMRI were treated with immediate cast removal followed by repeat closed reduction or open reduction, as per surgeon preference, with two of 33 (6%) requiring such further interventions. Salter criteria were then used to determine the proportion of AVN on radiographs at 1-year and final followup. Secondary outcomes including residual dysplasia and the need for further corrective surgery were ascertained through radiographic and retrospective chart review.

Results

At 1-year followup there was no difference in the proportion of AVN in the historical CT group as compared with the pMRI group (six of 25 [24%] versus one of 25 [4%]; odds ratio [OR], 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–363; p = 0.098). However, by final followup there was a statistically higher proportion of AVN in the CT group (seven of 25 [28%] versus one of 25 [4%]; OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 1.0–438; p = 0.049). No patient with normal perfusion on postreduction pMRI went on to develop AVN. In those pMRI patients in whom a successful reduction was initially obtained, two of 25 (8%) went on to require further corrective surgery and one of 25 (4%) had a redislocation event. With the numbers available, no patient-specific factors at the time of closed reduction were predictive of future AVN, including the patient's age/weight, the presence of an ossific nucleus, history of previous bracing treatment, or the abduction angle in spica cast.

Conclusions

A pMRI-based protocol immediately after closed reduction/spica casting may decrease the risk of AVN by helping the surgeon to evaluate femoral head vascularity. Although preliminary in nature, this study could serve to guide further investigation into the potential role of pMRI for the treatment of patients who require closed reduction/spica casting for DDH.

### Minimally-invasive dega osteotomy in ambulatory pediatric patients with residual developmental dysplasia of the hips – A technique and prospective case series [^1169k4M3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a prevalent disorder, characterized by anomalies in hip joint anatomy. This encompasses a shallow acetabulum, diminished femoral coverage, and a lateralized hip center. Management strategies typically depend on the patient's age and the extent of anatomical abnormalities. The overarching objective remains consistent: the attainment of a hip that is concentrically reduced within the acetabulum to prevent further dysplasia and future degenerative changes.

Treatment ranges from closed reduction with a Pavlik harness or spica cast to open or closed reduction with pelvic osteotomy for better acetabular coverage. The optimal timeframe for reduction and surgical technique and rehabilitation protocols remain controversial because they are often compounded by surgeon and institutional preferences.

Residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD) refers to persistent acetabular underdevelopment despite prior treatment for DDH, typically in a reduced but dysplastic hip. It occurs in approximately 3% to 20% of cases, with variability due to differences in diagnostic criteria, patient selection, and treatment protocols. -

The risk of RAD is strongly associated with the age at initial treatment, with earlier intervention leading to lower rates of residual dysplasia and reduced need for secondary surgery. Although most cases improve over time, RAD remains a notable risk factor for early osteoarthritis, especially when left untreated, and current data suggest that early surgery may be beneficial in these patients.

Open reduction through the anterior approach allows hip capsule access but risks lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury, whereas the medial approach facilitates reduction but risks obturator nerve and vascular injury, potentially causing osteonecrosis. - Recently, Canavese et al described a minimally invasive approach for acetabular dysplasia in nonambulatory cerebral palsy patients, reporting similar outcomes with less bleeding and shorter surgical times. However, our technique differs in its indications and goals because it is performed in non-cerebral palsy mobilizers, does not necessarily require adductor tenotomies as in the study by Canavese et al, and is applied to a generally younger and smaller ambulatory patient population. In addition, although their technique aims to prevent subluxation, ours is designed to correct RAD, enhance femoral head coverage, and reduce the risk of future degenerative changes.

This study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of the minimally invasive Dega osteotomy (MIDO) in ambulatory RAD patients. By minimizing surgical exposure and soft-tissue disruption, MIDO may offer advantages over standard techniques while ensuring adequate acetabular correction. We hypothesize that it provides similar clinical and radiographic outcomes with reduced morbidity and short recovery period.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^112NcgsB]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The small positive association between the proportion of the cohort with dementia (at least partially as a surrogate for greater frailty) and the proportion undergoing non‐operative management makes clinical sense but is too small to account for the variations. The extent to which biomechanical reasons (e.g. stable or old fractures) are a reason for variation in non‐operative management rates is also unclear. Data from the NHFD and ANZHFR show considerable between hospital/within‐country variation in reasons for non‐operative management. In addition, our previous work, and informal conversations with clinical colleagues, support the notion that external factors (e.g. perceived legal or reputational risk) and cultural factors (healthcare culture and societal expectations) may play at least a part in the decision to offer surgery.

### A global survey of patient and caregiver experiences throughout care for developmental dysplasia of the hip [^116HDhBD]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study highlights the variable experiences of patients and caregivers across diagnosis and treatment for hip dysplasia even within the same countries, as a first step to formally understand burden of the disease from the family perspective. We found substantial variation in age, number of visits to health care providers, timespan of care, and type and duration of treatments. Despite variation, our results demonstrate that DDH diagnosis and treatment can pose significant burden on patients and caregivers, necessitating multiple surgeries and procedures, many health care visits, and lengthy care duration. These findings underscore the worry and uncertainty that many participants reported.

Family history of hip dysplasia, breech birth, swaddling, and female sex are known risk factors for DDH. Despite reporting risk factors, many participants still received diagnosis after 3 months of age, and many reported they did not receive screening. These findings highlight potential knowledge gaps, where health care providers may be unaware of DDH risk factors that necessitate monitoring or screening, or gaps in resources where at-risk children are unable to receive recommended care. Participants identified another important issue: dismissal of patient concerns by health care professionals. This phenomenon has been documented across many medical disciplines; physician communication and listening skills are repeatedly highlighted by patients as critical components of establishing a trusting rapport with their healthcare provider. Together, these results emphasize the importance of global knowledge translation activities and educational efforts to raise awareness of DDH risk factors, signs, and symptoms among primary care providers, to increase physician awareness and improve identification, screening, and monitoring of at-risk children.

Most participants received treatment. Patients may not have received treatment due to mild diagnoses undergoing observation, very late diagnosis in adulthood and awaiting surgery, or awaiting first treatment at time of survey. Participants who reported diagnosis before 3 months old more often reported treatment with bracing only or with bracing and closed reduction only, compared to those with delayed diagnosis. Bracing is often the first line of treatment for uncomplicated cases, especially in infants below 6 months of age, as it is less invasive, and use during a less-mobile developmental period results in high success rate. Conversely, participants were more likely to report surgical management for older patients. Complications from surgery can be serious, and surgical intervention is typically used when nonoperative techniques are unsuccessful or due to decreased efficacy of bracing in older children. Our findings align with existing knowledge that later diagnosis may require more invasive treatments.–Participant-reported age at first surgery suggests a lapse between diagnosis and surgery where other treatment options were employed.

### Closed reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip: early-term results from a prospective, multicenter cohort [^117GzivG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Achieving, and maintaining, a concentric reduction of the hip is one of the primary drivers of future acetabular growth and development. Although potential overlap is likely, rates of failed initial reduction across the literature vary between 6% and 25%, and rates of loss of reduction from 0% to 18%. In this cohort, 91% of hips were successfully reduced on the initial attempt, with 9% going on to fail CR at latest follow-up. Importantly, however, rates of failed initial reduction are likely to vary considerably based upon the treating surgeon's threshold for proceeding directly to open reduction. Nevertheless, our results fall within the lower half of the previously reported ranges, suggesting reasonable success may be achieved following CR.

Several factors have been proposed to increase risk of residual dysplasia following CR. In this study, we chose to measure residual dysplasia in 2 ways: objective acetabular measurements (acetabular index and IHDI grade) and the incidence of further corrective surgery. Regarding the former, no patient-specific factors in this cohort were predictive of worsened acetabular index, including prereduction IHDI grade, age at reduction, or final AVN status. Regarding the latter, 11% of hips in this study were treated with a subsequent acetabuloplasty and/or femoral osteotomy, although that rate will likely rise with continued follow-up. In comparison, rates of further corrective surgery across the literature range as high as 57% to 100%, with the majority of published studies identifying a frequency ≤ 35%. In contrast to the acetabular index, we did observe that increased age at the time of CR predicted a higher rate of further corrective surgery, which is consistent with Luhmann et al'sobservation that delaying CR may increase the need for later intervention.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^112ub3J6]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The lack of data is startling. To our surprise, Europe appears relatively light on population and outcome data despite a strong tradition of hip fracture registries. Personal communications with some of the registries would suggest that more data are held than currently published and there are active projects to analyse data further. The lack of data from most of Africa is unsurprising; the number of people at risk of hip fracture is still relatively low, although demographic changes mean this will change in the next few decades.

As non‐randomised cohorts, all the studies are at considerable risk of bias by indication. In addition, aside from some of the national registries which can claim almost 100% capture of hip fracture data in their countries, there will inevitably be some degree of selection bias of the centres reporting data. The extent to which they serve populations that are different to the rest of their country or provide different approaches to non‐operative decision‐making is unanswerable. In many countries, almost all people with hip fractures will present to secondary care so reported data are likely to be representative of the local, if not national, population. In other parts of the world there is evidence that significant numbers either do not present to hospital or are not considered eligible for admission for a variety of reasons and will therefore be missing from any data presented here. For those countries, the proportions provided with operative management will be over‐estimated. The reasons why registry‐based data give lower estimates of rates of non‐operative management are unclear. This may be simply due to where the registries are based, or it may reflect under‐reporting by registries or over‐reporting by administrative data. It is certainly likely that registries miss some patients that never come to their attention. However, this does not seem likely to account for the large differences seen, notably between the UK NHFD (registry) data (with non‐operative rates of around 2%) and the administrative UK data for the same periods reported by Burrack et al. with rates of around 10%.

### Non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis: where are we now and where do we need to go? [^112N9b4B]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Given this background, proper guidance on the management of OA is needed. This issue has been addressed over recent months in updated guidelines or recommendations from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO). In addition, the OA Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee OA were updated and published recently. While previous OARSI guidelines addressed the management of hip and knee OA, the updated guidelines focused specifically on the knee, evaluating the safety and efficacy profiles of currently available treatment options. Given the relative paucity of novel data, the authors took an innovative approach to enhance the specificity of treatment recommendations: they defined OA clinical subphenotypes (knee-only OA with and without comorbidities; multijoint OA with and without comorbidities).

Commonly, we distinguish three treatment modalities: non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical. Figure 1 summarises treatments OARSI recommends are 'Appropriate' in at least one of the four subphenotypes. They suggest not using treatments rated 'Inappropriate' (eg, risedronate, electrotherapy), but others are rated 'Uncertain' (eg, acupuncture, chrondroitin, glucosamin or opioids). For the latter, the authors recommend physician–patient interaction to determine whether this treatment may have merit for an individual patient. Referral for consideration of orthopaedic surgical intervention is indicated after more conservative treatment options have been exhausted. Although both patients and doctors consider postponing surgery a success, for many patients joint replacement is eventually the final treatment option. This implies that, despite the variety of appropriate non-surgical treatment options, there are still considerable limitations in either success rate or tolerability when treating established knee OA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^117UYMfZ]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Exercise — Exercise is a well-studied intervention for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA). An SR and meta-analysis by Anwer et al. (2016) suggests home exercise programs with and without supervised clinic-based services improve pain and function in patients with OA of the knee, and the review included 15 RCTs and four case-controlled studies, including 4,270 patients with OA of the knee. An SR and meta-analysis by Beumer et al. (2016) included comparisons of land exercise versus minimal control in six studies and aquatic exercise versus minimal control in four studies for patients with OA of the hip, and both forms of exercise were found to be beneficial for pain and function in the short-term but the magnitude of the benefit decreased in medium- and long-term comparisons. An SR and meta-analysis by Tanaka et al. (2013) compared strengthening exercises and aerobic exercises to control; the review included eight RCTs (n = 505), all forms of exercise were effective for pain relief in the short-term, and there appeared to be a greater reduction in pain relief in the non-weight-bearing strength exercise group; however, the Work Group noted serious study limitations, which impacted some of the subgroup analyses.

### Late reduction in congenital dislocation of the hip and the need for secondary surgery: radiologic predictors and confounding variables [^116mAs1X]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite early recognition and appropriate treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip, there are a number of cases that subsequently require further surgery to prevent progressive dysplasia, instability, and eventual early osteoarthritis. This study aimed (1) to determine the incidence of pelvic osteotomy (PO) after late open (OR) or closed (CR) reduction for failed initial conservative treatment or late presentation; (2) study potential radiologic predictors of those that will require a secondary procedure; (3) and to evaluate the effect of potential confounding variables including age of reduction, Pavlik harness treatment, and surgical experience on PO rate.

Methods

All cases of congenital dislocation of the hip that presented late or had failed conservative treatment with subsequent late OR versus CR, that were carried out during 1988 to 2003, by the lead surgeon were included. Dislocations secondary to neuromuscular causes or teratologic causes were excluded. Intraoperative arthrograms confirmed the concentric or eccentric reduction and determined subsequent intervention. The AP pelvis plain radiograph was used to measure the height of dislocation, as described by Tonnis, and monitor Acetabular index, and ossific nucleus width and height postreduction.

Results

After 134 OR's, 24 hips (19%, 95% CI: 16–23%) later required a pelvic osteotomy compared with 59 out of 104 hips (58%, 95% CI: 49–68%) in the CR cohort. There was no statistical difference in avascular necrosis rates between late OR (10.9%, 95% CI: 4.8–17%) and CR (11.4%, 95% CI: 5.8–17%). Acetabular index was a reliable predictor for the need of subsequent PO becoming significantly different in those that did (PO group) and did not (non-PO group) require further surgery approximately 1.5 years postreduction. There was no difference in the ON development after reduction in both PO and non-PO groups. The PO requirement was not affected by earlier failed Pavlik harness treatment but did change with ongoing surgical experience. Late OR produced the lowest secondary procedure rate without an increase in the incidence of avascular necrosis. There is a learning curve to this procedure that will affect these outcomes.

AAOS developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) clinical practice guideline methods — The work group met in an introductory meeting on June 11–12, 2012 to establish scope, then held a two-day recommendation meeting on October 4–6, 2013 at which final recommendations were written and voted on, after which drafts were peer-reviewed, sent for public commentary, and sequentially approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value, AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. The original guideline and systematic review were prepared by the AAOS Detection and Nonoperative Management of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip in Infants up to 6 Months of Age physician work group. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the 2022 update to the 2014 guideline searched for all articles published between January 1, 2014, and April 16, 2020. Study selection criteria required that included studies meet all of the following: Study must be of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip; Article must be a full article report of a clinical study; Study must appear in a peer-reviewed publication; Study must be published in English; Study must be published in or after 1950; Study must be of humans; and Study must not be an in vitro study. The methods used to perform this clinical practice guideline were employed to minimize bias and enhance transparency in the selection, appraisal, and analysis of the available evidence.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants — natural history and spontaneous resolution: The long-term natural history appears related to the type and severity of hip abnormality, with mild dysplasia possibly not manifesting until adult life and severe dysplasia presenting with functional limitations during childhood; most DDH found in the newborn period appear to represent hip laxity and immaturity, and approximately 60%–80% of abnormalities identified by physical examination and more than 90% identified by ultrasound (US) appear to resolve spontaneously in early infancy, prompting questions about whether and when to use bracing; interventions to alter long-term natural history have included early bracing and manipulative and surgical options with advancing age, and prior literature has used inconsistent terminology and has not clarified which early abnormalities are progressive versus self-resolving.

### No evidence exists on outcomes of non-operative management in patients with femoroacetabular impingement and concomitant Tönnis grade 2 or more hip osteoarthritis: a scoping review [^1118WRiz]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) represents an abnormal hip morphology that may be a cause of development of hip osteoarthritis (OA) in view of the abnormal mechanical stresses being placed on the joint. Usually, FAI is initially managed non-operatively, and this includes activity modification/reduction, physiotherapy and analgesia. If symptoms persist, joint-preservation surgery can be considered. However, outcomes of surgery for FAI with concomitant moderate- to advanced hip OA (Tönnis Grade ≥ 2) are equivocal, with some reports suggesting poor results and high rates of conversion to THA in the literature. There is also concern that performing a joint-preservation procedure in this subgroup may lead to a rapid clinical decline that would require a THA sooner.

Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (FASHIoN and FAIT) have successfully demonstrated good short-term clinical outcomes following non-operative management in patients with FAI and Tönnis Grade 0 and 1, even if it underperformed when compared to hip arthroscopy.

In a recent systematic review by our group, inconclusive and contradictory results were found for outcomes of hip arthroscopy for FAI with Tönnis Grade 2 or more hip OA. Whilst a significant amount of hip preservation surgeons consider Tönnis Grade 2 to be a contraindication for hip preservation surgery, some experts reported favourable outcomes even in the context of moderate to advanced degeneration (Tönnis Grade 2 or more hip OA). These reports, however, did not include comparators with non-operative management.

In the context of a lack of consensus in the management of this specific patient cohort, the aim of the study was to investigate whether non-operative regimens alone may improve patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) and delay the need of subsequent surgery, either joint preservation or THA in patients with FAI and concomitant Tönnis Grade 2 or more hip OA.

### Surgical hip dislocation in fixation of acetabular fractures: extended indications and outcome [^111SgZoe]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical hip dislocation has been described as an excellent method for reduction and fixation of acetabular fractures. It allows a 360-degree access to the acetabulum and acetabular dome. However, reproducibility of this technique is still a concern. The primary outcome of this study was to investigate the short term functional and radiological outcome with the use of surgical hip dislocation in acetabular fractures. The secondary outcome was to describe different indications and methods of reduction using this technique.

Methods

This is a retrospective consecutive case series for the use of surgical hip dislocation in acetabular fractures. Between July 2013 and February 2017, we used this technique to manage 36 cases of acetabular fractures. Two patients were lost to follow up leaving 34 patients eligible for the study. All surgeries were done by a 5-years and a 10-years' experience surgeons in pelvic and acetabular trauma surgeries. Through Gibson approach, we used the technique of surgical hip dislocation as described by the Bernese group. Different methods of fracture reduction were used. Intraoperative grading of cartilage injury was done using Disler's grading system. Postoperative fracture reduction was evaluated using the criteria described by Matta. Clinical evaluation was done using the modified Merle d'Aubigne ́ and Postel system.

Results

The mean intra-operative blood loss was about 700 ± 35.4 ml. The mean units of blood transfused were 1 ± 0.1 unit. The mean surgical time was 135 ± 11.7 minutes. Anatomical reduction was achieved in 27 patients (79.4%). At a mean of 30 ± 16.8 months (median = 26 and IQR 22) follow up, the functional score was excellent in 5 (14.7%), very good in 8 (23.5%), good in 9 (26.5%), fair in 2 (5.8%), and poor in 10 (29.4%) patients. Four patients (11.7%) developed AVN at a mean of 8 months postoperatively. Conversion to THA was done in 5 patients (14,7%). Trochanteric osteotomy showed osseous healing in all cases. No patient developed nerve injury or infection. One patient developed severe (grade III) heterotopic ossification.

Conclusions

Besides the indications of surgical hip dislocation mentioned before as reduction of the anterior column in T and Transverse fractures, associated femoral head fractures, intraarticular fragments, and labral injuries, it can be used in other indications as entrapped posterior wall, roof impaction, pure impaction injuries and cranial extension of the posterior wall fractures. The technique is reproducible; however, the learning curve is steep and needs to be performed by experienced acetabular trauma surgeons.

### Treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip after walking age with open reduction, femoral shortening, and acetabular osteotomy [^116n2ixp]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The one-stage surgical treatment for developmental dysplasia of the hip-consisting of open reduction, femoral shortening, and pelvic osteotomy-is a demanding procedure, one that is more challenging, technically, than a staged procedure. It can, however, be done safely and effectively, providing good conditions for proper development of the hip joint in the older child who has untreated developmental dysplasia of the hip.

Limitations

As a retrospective study, this research is subject to potential selection bias. The absence of a control group limits direct comparative analysis. However, we compared our findings with those of other similar studies in the existing literature. In addition, this study contributes to a relatively underexplored area, as simultaneous bilateral single-stage triple procedure surgery for DDH is not extensively documented. Furthermore, the follow-up period in this study was limited to short-term to mid-term outcomes; a long-term follow-up study would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the procedure's durability and effectiveness. Despite these limitations, the authors believe that this study offers valuable information that can enhance clinical practice in the management of DDH.
