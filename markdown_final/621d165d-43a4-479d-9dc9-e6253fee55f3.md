## Question

A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for diarrhea. He states that he has experienced roughly 10 episodes of non-bloody and watery diarrhea every day for the past 3 days. The patient has a past medical history of IV drug abuse and recently completed treatment for an abscess with cellulitis. His vitals are notable for a pulse of 105/min. Physical exam reveals diffuse abdominal discomfort with palpation but no focal tenderness. A rectal exam is within normal limits and is Guaiac negative. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?
A. Clindamycin
B. Metronidazole
C. Oral rehydration and discharge
D. Vancomycin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the best initial treatment for a 55-year-old man with acute watery diarrhea, recent IV drug use, recent antibiotics for cellulitis/abscess, and mild tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether he is hemodynamically stable. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies given the history and exam, especially the risk for Clostridioides difficile infection. Next, I will review guideline-based management for acute watery diarrhea and CDI, including when to test and when to treat empirically. Finally, I will weigh the provided options against those recommendations and outline the correct initial management and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm stability and the need for fluids. He is alert, normotensive, afebrile, and has a pulse of 105/min, which suggests mild tachycardia likely from volume depletion rather than sepsis; oral rehydration is appropriate if he can tolerate it, with IV fluids reserved for those unable to drink, with severe dehydration, or with hemodynamic instability, so I should not jump to IV therapy unless indicated by clinical status or inability to hydrate orally [^116T8iZ1] [^112XuboH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics yet; I need to check the likely causes. The abrupt onset of non-bloody watery diarrhea over 3 days in an adult with recent antibiotic exposure strongly raises concern for CDI, which can occur within days to months after antibiotics, with clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams among the highest-risk agents; the absence of blood and focal peritoneal signs does not exclude CDI, and the rectal exam being guaiac negative does not rule it out either [^114VHrEv] [^113wP6Rr].

> Next, I should review guideline direction for acute watery diarrhea. The IDSA advises that empiric antimicrobial therapy is generally discouraged in acute watery diarrhea without recent international travel, given the predominance of viral etiologies and the modest average benefit of empiric antibiotics; instead, management should focus on rehydration and supportive care while evaluating for red flags and specific risks such as recent antibiotic use that would prompt CDI testing rather than immediate empiric antibiotics [^117NPL7v] [^111LYwyM].

> I will now examine CDI-specific guidance. Wait, let me verify the testing-first principle: current guidelines recommend confirming CDI with a stool test for toxin A/B or NAAT when clinically suspected, and they discourage empiric CDI treatment without confirmation unless there is fulminant disease or a substantial delay in diagnostics; when treatment is indicated, fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin are preferred first-line agents, and metronidazole is no longer first-line due to inferior efficacy and recurrence outcomes [^111oxKdy] [^1178XKj2].

> Let me consider the provided options carefully. Option A, clindamycin, is contraindicated because it is a high-risk antibiotic for precipitating CDI and would likely worsen the patient's risk profile; Option B, metronidazole, is outdated as first-line therapy for CDI and should be avoided empirically here; Option D, vancomycin, would be appropriate only if CDI is confirmed or strongly suspected with severe disease or diagnostic delay, not as initial empiric therapy for undifferentiated watery diarrhea; Option C, oral rehydration and discharge with appropriate precautions, aligns with guideline-based initial management for stable adults with acute watery diarrhea and suspected CDI risk, with outpatient testing and clear return precautions [^111oxKdy] [^117NPL7v] [^112XuboH].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating severity? I should double-check for red flags: fever, hypotension, severe abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, ileus, or immunocompromise would change management; none are present here, and the tachycardia is mild and likely volume responsive, so continued outpatient oral rehydration, strict hand hygiene, and prompt CDI testing are appropriate, with escalation to vancomycin or fidaxomicin if CDI is confirmed or if the patient deteriorates while awaiting results [^112XuboH] [^111oxKdy].

> Next, I should review the immediate next steps. I need to ensure stool testing for C. difficile is obtained before any antibiotics, provide oral rehydration guidance, and arrange close follow-up within 24–48 hours; if CDI is confirmed, I should start fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days, and if the patient becomes ill-appearing or develops severe features, I should reconsider inpatient management and combination therapy per severe CDI pathways [^111oxKdy] [^112WyyUQ].

> Final answer: Option C, oral rehydration and discharge with CDI testing and return precautions, is the best initial treatment for this stable patient with acute watery diarrhea and recent antibiotic exposure; empiric antibiotics are not indicated at this time, and clindamycin or metronidazole would be inappropriate, while vancomycin is reserved for confirmed CDI or severe disease with diagnostic delay [^117NPL7v] [^111oxKdy] [^112XuboH].

---

The best initial treatment is **oral rehydration and discharge** [^112XuboH] because the patient has acute, non-bloody, watery diarrhea without signs of severe illness or immunocompromise, and recent antibiotic use alone does not justify empiric antibiotics [^117NPL7v]. Empiric antibiotics are not indicated for acute watery diarrhea without red flags [^111LYwyM], and **clindamycin, metronidazole, or vancomycin** should only be considered if C. difficile infection is confirmed or strongly suspected with severe features [^1178XKj2]. The patient should receive oral rehydration, antiemetics as needed, and clear return precautions; stool testing for C. difficile is reasonable if symptoms persist or worsen [^112XuboH].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

- **Severity of diarrhea**: The patient reports approximately 10 episodes of non-bloody, watery diarrhea per day for 3 days, which is significant but not necessarily indicative of severe illness.

- **Vital signs**: Mild tachycardia (pulse 105/min) is present, but there are no signs of hypotension, fever, or hemodynamic instability.

- **Physical examination**: Diffuse abdominal discomfort without focal tenderness or peritoneal signs, and a normal rectal examination with guaiac-negative stool.

- **Risk factors**: Recent antibiotic use for cellulitis/abscess and history of IV drug use increase the risk of infectious diarrhea, including Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^114VHrEv].

---

## Indications for empiric antibiotic therapy in acute diarrhea

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, **empiric antibiotic therapy** is generally not recommended for acute watery diarrhea in immunocompetent adults without recent international travel [^111LYwyM]. Exceptions include patients who are severely ill, immunocompromised, or have specific risk factors such as recent antibiotic use with severe symptoms. In this patient, although recent antibiotic use increases the risk of CDI, the absence of severe symptoms (e.g. high fever, significant abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, or hemodynamic instability) does not warrant empiric antibiotic therapy [^117NPL7v].

---

## Evaluation for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)

Given the recent antibiotic use, **CDI should be considered**. However, empiric treatment for CDI is not recommended without confirmation of the diagnosis. The appropriate initial step is to obtain diagnostic testing (e.g. glutamate dehydrogenase antigen/toxin immunoassay, nucleic acid amplification test) [^113wP6Rr] if symptoms persist or worsen. If CDI is confirmed, targeted therapy with oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended [^1136xbnm]. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy due to lower efficacy and higher recurrence rates [^113ue2qN].

---

## Recommended initial management

Based on the current clinical presentation and guidelines, **the recommended initial management is**:

- **Oral rehydration therapy**: The cornerstone of treatment for acute watery diarrhea, particularly in patients with mild tachycardia suggesting mild dehydration [^112XuboH].

- **Supportive care**: Antiemetics for nausea/vomiting, antipyretics if fever develops, and dietary modifications as tolerated.

- **Monitoring**: Clear return precautions for worsening symptoms, development of fever, bloody diarrhea, or signs of dehydration.

- **Diagnostic testing**: Consider stool testing for CDI if symptoms persist beyond 3 days or worsen, given the recent antibiotic exposure [^114VHrEv].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best initial treatment for this patient is **oral rehydration and discharge** with supportive care and close monitoring. Empiric antibiotics (clindamycin, metronidazole, or vancomycin) are not indicated at this stage, as there is no evidence of severe illness, immunocompromise, or confirmed CDI. If symptoms persist or worsen, diagnostic testing for CDI and other pathogens should be pursued, and targeted antibiotic therapy initiated if indicated [^112XuboH].

Examples to illustrate nature of deaths judged to be preventable

A female patient in her early 80s presenting with watery diarrhoea where the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease took 18 days despite a past history of the disease. The patient had deteriorated significantly before appropriate treatment was commenced and failed to respond.

A middle aged male patient who developed infection at the site of a pharyngeal pouch excision. Antibiotic treatment was continued despite a failure to improve and subsequent open drainage proved too late.

A male patient in his 60s with previous history of ischaemic heart disease and treated carcinoma of the bladder (with no evidence of progression/ recurrence) underwent an unnecessary therapeutic ascitic tap when misdiagnosed as recurrent cancer when the actual diagnosis was congestive cardiac failure. He suffered a myocardial infarction after the procedure and went into multi-organ failure.

An obese woman in her 40s who presented with malaise, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, early saity and night sweats. The diagnosis of ovarian malignancy took 21 days to confirm. On day 19 the patient's breathlessness and tachycardia were treated as a chest infection. Two days later she collapsed and subsequently died from pulmonary embolism. No risk assessment undertaken or thromboprophylaxis prescribed during stay.

A 30 year old man with a history of drug and alcohol use admitted with worsening shortness of breath and green sputum. Initially condition treated as a community acquired pneumonia until CT scan showed possible lung abscess or empyema. Patient developed clostridium difficile diarrhoea which delayed chest drainage and then went on to have a cardiac arrest when an attempt at drain insertion was subsequently made on the ward. Following transfer to the intensive care unit and drain insertion he continued to deteriorate and died.

A female patient in her 80s on warfarin for atrial fibrillation and admitted with an infected finger which had been treated with a combination of antibiotics by her general practitioner. Despite daily warfarin at a dose of 1mg being continued, the international normalised ratio (INR) was not checked until day 3, 1-day after blood was first noted in her stools. When the INR was found to be well above therapeutic levels at 10, vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were administered with the clinical team commenting that a preferred treatment was not available at the time. Despite ongoing resuscitation she continued to deteriorate and died.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Enteric fever [^113bQGJj]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Follow-up

Fever resolves in five to 10 days, but patients often feel better sooner as fever intervals and intensity improve. Antibiotic treatment durations of 7–14 days or five days after fever resolution, whichever is longer, have traditionally been used. In clinical trials, shorter durations of between three and five days of ceftriaxone and ofloxacin have proved effective in uncomplicated disease. Patients commenced on parenteral antimicrobials can be switched to oral medications once they are clinically stable. If the susceptibility pattern is known, de-escalate from a broad spectrum to a narrow spectrum drug.

Re-evaluate patients with persistent high fever and symptoms after 7–10 days of treatment. Blood culture can be repeated to detect antimicrobial resistance or another diagnosis.

Fever after CAR T-cell therapy — management algorithm details the initial infectious work-up, empiric therapy, and branch actions. For neutropenic/non-neutropenic patients, radiology includes CT chest and sinus with consideration of CT abdomen/pelvis if intra-abdominal symptoms, and labs include blood cultures, urinalysis with urine culture, respiratory pathogen panel PCR, IL-6, ferritin, Clostridioides difficile testing when active diarrhea, and respiratory culture/MRSA nares screen if active respiratory symptoms. Empiric treatment is to initiate IV antibiotics with an anti-Pseudomonal beta-lactam ± vancomycin, hold bacterial prophylaxis if previously on, and consider broader coverage if history of multidrug-resistant organisms. If there is clinical, microbiological, or radiographic evidence of infection, treat infection. If there is no clinical, microbiology, or radiographic evidence of infection and the patient is afebrile ≥ 48h, discontinue empiric antibiotics and resume bacterial prophylaxis if neutropenia persists; if febrile, formal ID consultation is highly recommended and additional considerations include repeat imaging, bronchoscopy if abnormal CT chest, repeat blood cultures, fungal markers (e.g. Galactomannan, beta-D-glucan), UA/urine culture, and assessing non-infectious etiologies such as CRS, drug fever, or deep vein thrombosis.

The Study

In September 2013, a 19-year-old woman (patient 1) sought care in the emergency department (ED) of the UC San Diego Medical Center, reporting a 2-day history of headache, fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and right upper quadrant pain. Two days earlier she had injected heroin, using a clean needle and a previously used cotton filter. At admission, she had a fever (100°F), increased heart rate (112 beats/min), and right upper quadrant tenderness but no evidence of endocarditis. Test results showed leukocytosis (26.0 × 10 9 cells/L) and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (107 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (112 U/L), and C-reactive protein (CRP; 6.5 mg/dL). Results for rapid HIV antibody test, acute hepatitis panel, and urine pregnancy test were negative. Intravenous (IV) fluids and empiric IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were administered; symptoms and clinical status were improved the next day. Cultures (4/4) of blood samples collected at admission grew B. cereus sensitive to clindamycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin. Transthoracic echocardiography showed no abnormalities.

Over the next 2 days, she remained afebrile and symptoms resolved, but bacteremia persisted. On hospital day 5, given the persistent bacteremia, we stopped piperacillin/tazobactam and started IV ciprofloxacin. Gentamicin was added on days 8–12 for its potential synergistic effect; bacteremia resolved on day 9. IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were continued for 4 weeks.

Fifteen days after patient 1 was admitted, a 43-year-old man (patient 2) sought care at the same institution for low back pain. He had used heroin 2 days earlier; injection technique details are unknown. At admission, he was afebrile and had vital signs and blood cell counts within the normal range, no focal neurologic findings, and unrevealing magnetic resonance imaging results. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of musculoskeletal back pain. After B. cereus grew in 1 of 2 blood cultures, he was asked to return. Although asymptomatic and lacking any stigmata of endocarditis, he was admitted for further observation and started empirically on IV vancomycin. Blood cultures continued to grow clindamycin- and vancomycin-sensitive B. cereus until hospital day 4. Transesophageal echocardiography showed no evidence of endocarditis. IV vancomycin was continued for 2 weeks.

### Secondary bacterial peritonitis and pelvic abscess due to… [^115GouH5]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 70-year-old man with a history of hepatic cirrhosis presented with abdominal discomfort and distention. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, positive fluid wave and abdominal tenderness. Due to concerns for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), paracentesis was performed. Fluid analysis revealed 5371 total nucleated cells with 48% neutrophils. Ceftriaxone was then initiated for the treatment of SBP. Bacterial cultures of the fluid, however, grew Clostridiumdifficile Therefore, metronidazole was added. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a pelvic fluid collection that was suspicious for an abscess on an abdominal CT scan. The patient underwent CT-guided drain placement into the pelvic fluid collection. The fluid aspirate was consistent with an abscess. However, cultures were negative in the setting of ongoing antibiotic therapy. The patient was treated with a 10-day course of ceftriaxone and metronidazole and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up.

### Severe drug-associated colitis with Crohn's features in setting of ixekizumab therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis [^111bM1kB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old male patient presented to our institution with a 3-week history of diffuse abdominal pain, tenesmus, and over 10 episodes of non-bloody diarrhea per day. The patient did not have nausea or vomiting nor did he report fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss. In the week prior to his presentation, he was assessed by his family physician who had ordered a panel of stool nucleic acid amplification tests which were negative for gastrointestinal infections. He was then trialed on a brief course of proton pump inhibitor as an outpatient with no improvement in his symptoms before presenting to the emergency department.

The only significant past medical history for our patient was a long-standing history of plaque psoriasis for which he was being treated with Ixekizumab. He had previously undergone multiple courses of biologic treatments with adjunctive phototherapy but did not achieve reasonable control of his disease until he was switched to Ixekizumab approximately 9 months ago. The patient did not have a family history of IBD or early onset colorectal cancer. He is a life-long non-smoker and he does not report excessive alcohol use. There was no history of recent travel, blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, or new sexual contacts.

On initial assessment, the patient was hemodynamically stable with diffuse non-peritonitic abdominal pain on physical examination. His laboratory investigations demonstrated marked elevation in his inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein of 388 mg/L) as well as a hepatocellular pattern of liver enzyme elevation (aspartate aminotransferase 234 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 142 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 143 U/L). A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed revealing continuous circumferential bowel wall thickening of the left colon from the rectum to the splenic flexure on a background of reactive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service and our gastroenterology experts were consulted for further endoscopic evaluation.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^114VHrEv]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^112XuboH]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### Clostridioides difficile infection evaluation and management in the emergency department [^112UE5on]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), characterized primarily by diffuse diarrhea in the setting of recent healthcare and antibiotic exposure, maintains significantly high rates of diagnosis in the U.S., even in the emergency department (ED). Recent updates in the literature concerning CDI should be considered for effective clinical practice in the ED setting.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of current data for the ED-based evaluation and management of CDI.

Discussion

Substantial literature on the risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and treatment regimens have recently published concerning CDI. These studies include evaluation of risks associated with specific antibiotic classes, demonstrating that even single doses of antibiotics pose significant risk of CDI. Disproportional increases in elderly CDI rates show particular vulnerability in this population. Updated literature reveals presenting symptoms with wide ranges in rates of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and nausea with vomiting. In some patients diarrhea may be altogether absent, clouding clinical suspicion. Classification primarily centers on a non-severe/severe division from the IDSA. Treatment has largely shifted away from metronidazole as a first-line antibiotic, instead focusing on oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, even for an initial episode of CDI in an uncomplicated patient. Attention to hand hygiene and adherence to contact precautions are key to infection prevention.

Conclusions

CDI cause significant illness throughout the U.S. Successful CDI diagnosis and management in the ED require current knowledge of risk, presentation, diagnosis, and proper antibiotic treatment.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^116PSdkr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship — culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.

### Case report of an unusual combination of purulent pericarditis and false aneurysm of the ascending aorta [^117MCZ3r]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 42-year-old man was admitted to a Swiss regional hospital with a complaint of tiredness associated with a 2 weeks' history of diarrhea, jaundice and 3 days of legs edema. His medical history has shown intravenous drug use, untreated HIV, and advanced liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C infection. He had been treated the past month for a chronic ulcer of the right ankle.

On initial physical examination, the patient was obviously shocked with somnolence, dehydration, and marbling of the extremities. Cutaneous status was remarkable for presence of sequels of multiples intravenous injections, necrosis of 3 toes and persistence of the right ankle's ulcer.

Vitals signs were the following: BP 116/79 mmHg, HR 152 bpm, temp 36.8 °C and oxygen saturation 93%, while breathing ambient air. Arterial blood gases were rapidly obtained and showed lactic acidosis with a pH of 7.28 and a concentration of lactates of 8 mmol/l. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with electrical alternans and the chest X- Ray revealed a massively enlarged cardiac silhouette (Fig. 1a). A point of care ultrasound (POCUS) was then performed and confirmed a large pericardial effusion (Fig. 1b).

Fig. 1
a Chest X-ray showing enlarged cardiac silhouette; b POCUS picture revealing a very large pericardial effusion

Laboratory analyses indicated anemia, leukocytosis with severe lymphopenia, thrombopenia, hyponatremia, hyperkaliemia, a slightly elevated CRP and acute renal failure.

The diagnosis of obstructive shock caused by a large pericardial effusion was made and the patient was transferred to a reference hospital for treatment. On admission to the emergency service of this hospital a percutaneous pericardial drainage was rapidly employed to withdraw 1250 mL of purulent liquid with subsequent normalization of blood pressure. A computed tomography revealed multiple pulmonary, hepatic and splenic septic emboli, as well as lobar pulmonary embolism with bilateral thrombosis of the ilio-femoral veins. A transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal ventricular function and no valvular vegetations or other endocarditis echography signs. The pulmonary pressure was normal and there was no interatrial shunt at the color Doppler. The patient was then started on empirical Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Vancomycin and admitted to the ICU. Blood culture drawn at admission and culture of the pericardial effusion showed a Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotherapy spectrum was narrowed with administration of Flucloxacillin only.

### Treatment of anticholinergic-induced ileus with neostigmine [^111YNpUU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old man with a history of recreational benztropine abuse presented to the emergency department with confusion, abdominal pain, and distention. An abdominal radiograph revealed gross fecal loading. He was initially treated with intravenous fluids and opiate analgesia. Subsequently, a diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning was made, based on tachycardia, delirium, dry mucosa, and reduced bowel sounds. Treatment with tacrine reversed the delirium, and a history of repeated benztropine use was obtained. Persistent ileus was treated with repeated doses of neostigmine, and gastrointestinal motility returned with prompt defecation. Neostigmine appears to be useful in reversing ileus caused by anticholinergic drug overdose. Theoretically, it may be useful in reversing anticholinergic ileus resulting from acute drug overdose, allowing or enhancing decontamination, but the safety and potential efficacy of neostigmine in this scenario have not been established.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is the most common pathogen implicated in healthcare-associated infections in the United States (US). Recent data suggest that ~40% of C. difficile infections (CDIs) in the US are community-associated, which often do not have risk factors such as antibiotic exposure or hospitalization commonly associated with healthcare-associated CDI. In Europe, the incidence of CDI is lower than in the US. It is the eighth most frequently reported microorganism in healthcare-associated infections, with increasing incidence in most countries; the majority of cases (76.4%) are healthcare-associated.

CDI classically presents with watery diarrhea (Bristol stool scale 6–7, three or more times a day) and crampy abdominal pain, with or without fever. In rare cases with ileus or a megacolon, diarrhea may not be present. Diagnosis is made by a positive stool test in the presence of typical clinical features. A gamut of tests is available, and the choice of test depends on the institutional protocol and test availability.

Management of CDI has changed significantly in the last few years, with several new treatment options available. In this article, we describe the treatment of primary and recurrent CDI in adults as recommended by recent guidelines along with investigational therapies for CDI.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^112Ld3SB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Tigecycline maintains satisfactory profiles of safety and efficacy in treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria, in complicated intra-abdominal infections. Judicious use of antibiotics for multidrug resistant pathogens is important to preserve their effectiveness, and tigecycline is one of the few available compounds active against multidrug resistant strains. It may be more suitable to use tigecycline for empiric or definitive treatment of patients with high risk intra-abdominal infections. Combinations with other broad-spectrum antibiotics may be suitable in critically ill patients or in patients with health-care infections known or suspected to be owing to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Adequate therapy

Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important. Inadequate duration of treatment is probably the main inappropriate use of antibiotics in surgical practice and the intensive care unit. Antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until normalization of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and WBC count. If clinical signs and symptoms persist after a reasonable course of antibiotic therapy, another infectious cause should be sought rather than prolonging antibiotic treatment for the initial infection.

Unnecessary broad coverage or prolonged therapy can carry high costs, toxicities of therapy and Clostridium difficile colitis superinfection. Clostridium difficile causes 15%-25% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity of which ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis.

Over the past years, some Authors have investigated procalcitonin (PCT) to guide duration of antibiotic therapy. Currently, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a laboratory variable that allows early differentiation between SIRS and sepsis. It was recently been used to guide antibiotic treatment in medical patients with pulmonary diseases.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — "Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients" and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients "should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day". Exercise is advised with a "regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program", and initially "exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises". For rescue volume expansion, "1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days"; although not trial-tested, "this approach is recommended as rescue therapy", whereas "Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care". To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, "low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate", while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with "Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study" showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, "Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", and "The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency". For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine "significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline" and "should be administered 3 times daily", with dosing "only… during daytime hours" due to supine hypertension risk.

### Current strategies for management of initial Clostridium difficile infection [^112EHp8n]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In the past decade, an epidemic strain of Clostridium difficile has led to increased incidence and severity of nosocomial C. difficile infections (CDI). Responsiveness to standard antimicrobial care for this strain is declining, and the morbidity and mortality of CDI and recurrent CDI are rising. Effective management requires a coordinated effort among all members of the healthcare team to facilitate early identification of patients at risk for CDI, early recognition of disease onset and confirmatory testing, prompt initiation of the most appropriate management approach, and ongoing monitoring throughout the continuum of care. Hospitalists, as coordinators of patient care, are in an ideal position to ensure that patients receive prompt and optimal treatment based on current clinical evidence and severity of the disease.

The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

Case presentation

A 51-year-old woman with metastatic ER positive, PR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer who previously received multiple lines of therapy, most recently sacituzumab govitecan, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary embolism, and asthma, initially presented outpatient with three days of anorexia, non-bloody vomiting, large-volume watery diarrhea, and poor oral intake. No fever or chills. Home medications include amlodipine, apixaban, metformin, rosuvastatin, and levothyroxine. No proton pump inhibitor or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She received IV fluids and was sent to the emergency department. Five days before the onset of symptoms, she received the second dose of first cycle of sacituzumab govitecan. In the outside hospital, she was found to have tachycardia, fever, normal blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Work-up revealed absolute neutrophil count 100, hemoglobin 10.2, platelet 112, sodium 125, potassium 4.2, serum creatinine 3.43, serum bicarbonate 17, anion gap of 19, normal lactate. Urine culture on admission was negative. She received cefepime and vancomycin, later deescalated to cefepime after blood cultures grew Proteus mirabilis. Vancomycin level was supratherapeutic at 30.4mcg/mL before it was discontinued. She received symptomatic treatment for nausea and diarrhea and was maintained on IV fluids. Non-contrast CT ruled out obstructive uropathy. However, her creatinine rose to 6.5 g/dL.

She was transferred to our hospital for further management. On presentation, she was confused, febrile, normotensive, and had atrial fibrillation in rapid ventricular response, requiring ICU admission. CT head showed no acute abnormality. She did not require pressors and blood pressure remained stable with IV fluids. Atrial fibrillation initially reverted to sinus rhythm with metoprolol. Cefepime was continued for neutropenic sepsis. IV sodium bicarbonate was started for severe metabolic acidosis. Despite supportive treatment, oliguric AKI continued to worsen; creatinine 7.32, and BUN 77, therefore continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on hospital day 2. During CRRT, atrial fibrillation recurred, prompting amiodarone loading. Metabolic acidosis improved. CRRT was discontinued on hospital day 7. However, urine output remained minimal. IV furosemide and intermittent hemodialysis were started (Supplementary).

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^111AbvjT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and metronidazole were historically considered equivalent therapies for the management of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI); however, recent data confirm more favorable outcomes with vancomycin. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that has an advantage in reducing recurrence rates compared with vancomycin, possibly owing to its sparing effect on normal colonic microbiota. Data are limited for guiding management of CDI recurrences, particularly multiple recurrences. Several empiric approaches to manage these cases are reviewed.

### A 76-year-old man with recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: review of C. difficile infection [^1157fVA3]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common and increasingly severe nosocomial infectious disease. The case of Mr S, a 76-year-old man with multiple recurrences of CDI, illustrates the difficulties in treating recurrent disease and the way it complicates the management of other medical conditions. Risk factors for CDI include antimicrobial use, hospital admission, advancing age, and severe underlying disease. A clinical diagnosis of CDI is usually confirmed by identifying C. difficile toxins in a stool sample. Evidence supports metronidazole, 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, as the treatment of choice for mild to moderately severe CDI. Oral vancomycin, 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, is recommended for severe CDI, for which it is more effective than metronidazole. Recurrent CDI occurs in more than 20% of patients when metronidazole or vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Few studies have evaluated treatment options for recurrent CDI, but a prolonged, tapering, and pulse-dosed regimen of oral vancomycin is commonly used. Careful attention to antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices is essential to curb this nosocomial, iatrogenic disease.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^115EdJNc]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is an increasing burden to the health care system, totaling more than $1 billion/year in the United States. Treatment of patients with C difficile infection with metronidazole or vancomycin reduces morbidity and mortality, although the number of patients that do not respond to metronidazole is increasing. Despite initial response rates of greater than 90%, 15%-30% of patients have a relapse in symptoms after successful initial therapy, usually in the first few weeks after treatment is discontinued. Failure to develop specific antibody response has recently been identified as a critical factor in recurrence. The review discusses the different management strategies for initial and recurrent symptomatic C difficile infections.

Participants

The study was conducted at 32 sites in the United States, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Ukraine (see Supplementary Appendix 1 for a list of the investigators), and enrolled hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older, with a diagnosis of ABSSSI, who required IV antibacterial treatment, and had at least 1 of the following: wound infection, cellulitis or erysipelas, or major cutaneous abscess (restricted to 30% or less of the study population). Patients were also required to have at least 1 regional or systemic sign of infection, including lymphadenopathy, fever, leukocytosis or leukopenia, or greater than 10% immature neutrophils.

Exclusion criteria included prior systemic antibacterial treatment within 14 days (or topical antibacterial administration on the primary lesion within 96 hours) prior to the first dose of study drug, primary uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, diabetic foot infection, gangrene, perianal abscess, concomitant infection at another site (except secondary ABSSSI), infected burns, decubitus or chronic skin ulcer, ischemic ulcer due to peripheral vascular disease, any evolving necrotizing process, infection at vascular catheter sites or thrombophlebitis, and severe sepsis or septic shock.

During the conduct of the study, in order to limit the proportion of injection drug users enrolled, the eligibility criteria were amended to exclude patients with illicit drug use within 12 months of screening, including heroin, other opioids (unless prescribed for medical reasons unrelated to heroin substitution), cocaine/crack cocaine, and amphetamine/methamphetamine, but excluding cannabis use. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Supplementary Appendix 2.

Populations for endpoint analysis included the following: (1) intent-to-treat (ITT), comprising all randomized patients; (2) microbiological ITT (mITT), comprising the subset of the ITT who have confirmed causative pathogens; (3) clinically evaluable (CE), comprising the subset of the ITT who have no major protocol deviations and a completed response outcome assessment; (4) microbiologically evaluable (ME), comprising the subset of the mITT who are also in the CE population; and (5) the safety population, comprising all randomized patients receiving 1 or more doses of study drug.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^113D9uKT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are currently only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for CDI: vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Fidaxomicin was approved for use in adult patients with initial episode of CDI in 2011. Metronidazole has never received FDA approval and is used off label. With this basic understanding, this manuscript is designed to describe the evolution of the antimicrobial treatment guidelines in the US, including all global guidelines to compare and contrast the recommendations understanding the differences among these documents and how they have evolved over time. It is important to consider that, outside of the US, the impact of CDI and associated strains are seen differently and this will influence the recommendations made. The priority of this manuscript is to focus on the changes in these guideline documents over the prior decade.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112WyyUQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — initial and severe/fulminant CDI treatment recommend for an initial nonsevere episode that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) or that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), while oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 d may be considered in low-risk patients. As initial therapy for severe CDI, we recommend vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 d (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and we recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with fulminant CDI should receive medical therapy that includes adequate volume resuscitation and treatment with 500 mg of oral vancomycin every 6 hr (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for the first 48–72 hr, and combination therapy with parenteral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hr can be considered (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an ileus, the addition of vancomycin enemas (500 mg every 6 hr) may be beneficial (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

AE severity: ≤ 1 day of symptoms.
System response: Repeat ED visit and admission to hospital.
Responsible service: ED services (unsafe disposition decision given no reassessment examination documented, management AE based on discharge 1 hour after arrival in moderate respiratory distress).

Procedural complication (not preventable): A 1-year-old child presents with worsening cellulitis of left leg despite 4 days of adequate dose outpatient antibiotics. An intravenous is placed for intravenous antibiotics in left hand and admission to hospital planned. Good blood flow from intravenous after placement, intravenous is well secured and child's arm is placed on an arm board. One hour after intravenous placement, intravenous pump rings as occluded and left hand is noted to be puffy and slightly tender on palpation, and intravenous is found to be interstitial. Intravenous is removed. Puffy hand/tenderness resolve within 2 hours.

AE severity: ≤ 1 day of symptoms.
System response: Symptoms only.
Responsible service: ED services.

Suboptimal follow-up (preventable): A 15-year-old boy presents with 2-week history of diarrhoea, now bloody for last 3 days. History of 1 kg weight loss. Family history of Crohn's disease, no travel history. Examination including vitals is normal. Complete blood count shows haemoglobin of 95 g/L with normocytic pattern and erythrocyte sedation rate is reported as 50. Child is discharged with follow‐up to gastroenterology service in 48 hours. Child returns to the ED 7 days later with increasing bloody diarrhoea, tachycardia, dizziness and a further 2 kg of weight loss and has not been seen by gastroenterology service. Admitted to the hospital for management of presumed inflammatory bowel disease presentation.

Outcome assessment

We followed an established two-step outcome assessment modelled on the seminal Harvard Practice Study and other studies that sought to measure adverse events.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated diarrheal disease empiric therapy — evaluation by CD4 count and severity — includes that patients should be given oral or intravenous (IV) rehydration, if indicated (AIII), dietary measures such as consuming a bland diet and avoiding fat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates are likely to be useful (BIII), and antimotility agents should be avoided if there is concern about inflammatory diarrhea, including CDI (BIII). After obtaining stool samples for diagnostic evaluation, initiation and duration of empiric antimicrobial therapy depend upon the patient's CD4 count and clinical appearance, and if stool samples are obtained, antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed to confirm and inform antibiotic choice. No further work-up may be necessary and no treatment other than oral rehydration may be required in patients with CD4 counts > 500 cells/mm3 who have had 1 to 2 days of loose stools without fever or blood, whereas a short course of antibiotics may be indicated in patients with CD4 counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3 with diarrhea severe enough to compromise quality of life or ability to work. Patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e. CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 or concomitant AIDS-defining illness) and clinically severe diarrhea (i.e., ≥ 6 liquid stools per day or bloody stools or a lower number of liquid stools per day but accompanied by fever or chills concerning for invasive bacterial disease) should undergo diagnostic evaluation to determine the etiology of the diarrheal illness and receive antimicrobial treatment. Empiric therapy with ciprofloxacin is reasonable (AIII) and IV ceftriaxone or IV cefotaxime are reasonable alternatives (BIII), therapy should be adjusted based on the diagnostic work-up, and diarrhea that is persistent (i.e., lasting > 14 days) without other clinical signs of severity should be evaluated and directed therapy started once a diagnosis is confirmed.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 focused update — rationale for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin states that the panel agrees the balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial episode of CDI, with moderate certainty of evidence; the panel also judges the use of fidaxomicin is likely cost-effective, acceptable to patients and providers, and feasible to implement when considering dosing and duration, and notes that achieving both initial and sustained clinical responses are key goals and that lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin are an important advantage.
