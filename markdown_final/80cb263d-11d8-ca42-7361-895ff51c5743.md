## Question

can i use trazadone with zolpidem

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trazodone can be used together with zolpidem, and if so, how to do it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pharmacology and whether there is a mechanistic rationale for combining them. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about coadministration with other CNS depressants. Next, I will review clinical evidence for efficacy and safety, including randomized trials and observational data. After that, I need to check for any direct pharmacokinetic interactions and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation with dosing, monitoring, and counseling points, and I should confirm whether any major guidelines endorse this approach.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and potential synergy. Trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor with prominent alpha-1 blockade and histamine H1 antagonism, yielding sedation and orthostatic effects, whereas zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor agonist with rapid onset and short duration. Mechanistically, they target different pathways, which could theoretically complement each other for sleep onset and maintenance, but I need to ensure we do not overlook additive CNS depression and next-day impairment risks [^e3f2e519] [^c36098a1].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before jumping to conclusions. The FDA zolpidem label warns that coadministration with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression, drowsiness, psychomotor impairment, and impaired driving, and it advises dosage adjustments and caution when combining with such agents. It also notes that use with other sedative-hypnotics at bedtime is not recommended, which is a key caution I should not gloss over [^c36098a1] [^213663c6] [^4c88419e].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence. In a high-quality sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, patients who did not remit with initial zolpidem benefited from switching to trazodone, with significant increases in remission rates and sustained improvements in daytime functioning, which supports the concept of switching rather than layering. However, this is not the same as routine nightly combination, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize to concurrent use [^81ba2a61] [^76742d50].

> Hold on, I should verify safety signals from real-world data. Large observational cohorts in older adults show that both zolpidem and trazodone independently increase fall risk compared with nonusers, and trazodone may carry a higher fall risk than zolpidem in some analyses. In hemodialysis patients, zolpidem initiation is associated with higher 30-day fracture risk than trazodone, underscoring that the risk profiles differ by population and dose, but neither dataset supports routine combination therapy [^5d3d4207] [^bc4a1956] [^a8605d19].

> I need to check for direct pharmacokinetic interaction. A controlled crossover study found no meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction between zolpidem and trazodone when given together, though both are CNS depressants and can produce additive sedation. This supports that any concern is primarily pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic, but it does not negate the risk of excessive CNS depression when combined [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations and dosing nuances. In older adults, both agents increase fall risk and next-day impairment, so if any combination is contemplated, doses should be minimized and monitoring intensified. For zolpidem, start at 5 mg in women and older adults, and avoid doses above 10 mg. For trazodone, when used for sleep, typical off-label doses are 25–100 mg at bedtime, with lower starting doses in frail patients. I should confirm that no guideline endorses routine combination in older adults, and indeed, geriatric guidance emphasizes fall risk mitigation and avoidance of sedative polypharmacy [^4c88419e] [^5389bc15] [^3a1b8d6f].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is treatment-resistant insomnia after a failed monotherapy trial. In that context, a time-limited, carefully monitored switch strategy or sequential use may be reasonable, as suggested by the SMART trial, whereas chronic nightly co-administration lacks supportive evidence and increases additive CNS depression risk. I should double-check that no major guideline explicitly recommends routine combination, and I do not find such endorsements in AASM or VA/DoD documents, which instead emphasize monotherapy selection, CBT-I, and cautious pharmacotherapy sequencing [^81ba2a61] [^55cd2f07] [^c594fa8d].

> I will now examine practical safeguards if, despite these concerns, a clinician elects a short-term, closely supervised combination for refractory insomnia. Use the lowest effective doses, typically zolpidem 5 mg and trazodone 25–50 mg at bedtime, ensure at least 7–8 hours before planned awakening, avoid other CNS depressants including alcohol, and reassess within 1–2 weeks for efficacy and adverse effects. Counsel on next-day impairment and falls, and consider tapering one agent if benefits are marginal or risks emerge [^4c88419e] [^5389bc15] [^c36098a1].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any authoritative source provides a direct yes or no. I do not find a guideline that explicitly approves routine nightly coadministration of trazodone and zolpidem, and the FDA labeling for zolpidem advises against combining with other sedative-hypnotics at bedtime due to additive CNS effects, which argues against standard combination therapy. Therefore, the balance of evidence and labeling supports avoiding routine combination and favoring monotherapy, CBT-I, or carefully monitored sequential strategies when needed [^c36098a1] [^55cd2f07] [^c594fa8d].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Routine nightly coadministration of trazodone and zolpidem is not recommended due to additive CNS depression, increased risks of next-day impairment, and falls, with no robust evidence supporting combined use. If insomnia remains refractory after appropriate monotherapy and behavioral therapy, a time-limited, low-dose, closely monitored switch or sequential approach may be considered, but chronic combination should be avoided and patients should be counseled on risks and fall prevention [^c36098a1] [^81ba2a61] [^5d3d4207].

---

It is **generally not recommended** to combine trazodone and zolpidem because both are CNS depressants with additive sedative effects, which increases the risk of excessive sedation, respiratory depression, impaired coordination, and falls, especially in older adults [^c36098a1] [^5d3d4207]. If combination therapy is considered, it should be reserved for refractory insomnia under close medical supervision, with the lowest effective doses, careful monitoring for adverse effects, and avoidance of other CNS depressants, including alcohol [^4c88419e] [^cf3bfe56]. There is **no strong evidence** supporting routine combination use, and guidelines favor monotherapy or CBT-I as first-line treatment [^55cd2f07] [^c9bd766e].

---

## Pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of action

Trazodone is a **serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI)** with sedating properties due to H1 histamine blockade and alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism; it is used off-label for insomnia, typically at 25–100 mg nightly [^e3f2e519]. Zolpidem is a **non-benzodiazepine hypnotic** that selectively agonizes GABA-A receptors, rapidly inducing sleep with minimal next-day residual effects at standard doses (5–10 mg nightly) [^4c88419e].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of combination therapy

Combining trazodone and zolpidem **increases the risk of additive CNS depression**, leading to:

- **Excessive sedation**: Profound drowsiness, confusion, and impaired cognitive function [^c36098a1].
- **Respiratory depression**: Rare but serious, especially with underlying respiratory conditions or concomitant CNS depressants [^5e3a97db].
- **Impaired motor coordination**: Higher risk of falls, fractures, and accidents, particularly in older adults [^5d3d4207].
- **Next-day impairment**: Reduced alertness, impaired driving, and memory disturbances [^c36098a1].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting the routine combination of trazodone and zolpidem. Major guidelines (AASM, VA/DoD) recommend monotherapy or CBT-I as first-line treatment and do not endorse combination therapy [^55cd2f07] [^c594fa8d]. A randomized clinical trial showed that switching from zolpidem to trazodone improved insomnia outcomes, but it did not evaluate concurrent use [^81ba2a61].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy might be considered

Combination therapy may be considered only in **refractory insomnia** when:

- **Monotherapy failure**: Multiple single-agent trials (including CBT-I) have failed [^c9bd766e].
- **Comorbid conditions**: Anxiety, depression, or PTSD complicate insomnia management [^notfound].
- **Close supervision**: A specialist oversees care with careful monitoring and dose titration.

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring strategies

If combination therapy is used, **start low and go slow**:

| **Medication** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Maximum dose** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trazodone | 25–50 mg PO qHS | 100 mg | Bedtime |
| Zolpidem | 5 mg PO qHS (women); 5–10 mg PO qHS (men) | 10 mg | Bedtime |

---

Monitor for **excessive sedation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, and falls**; reassess frequently and discontinue if adverse effects occur or if there is no meaningful benefit within a few weeks [^c36098a1].

---

## Alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological options

Given the risks, consider **alternatives**:

- **CBT-I**: First-line for chronic insomnia with durable benefits [^c9bd766e].
- **Orexin antagonists**: Suvorexant, lemborexant, daridorexant are effective and may have fewer next-day effects [^notfound].
- **Melatonin agonists**: Ramelteon or melatonin for sleep-onset difficulties [^notfound].
- **Other antidepressants**: Doxepin 3–6 mg (FDA-approved for insomnia) or mirtazapine in select cases [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

Age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications **significantly affect risk**; older adults have higher fall risk, patients with respiratory disease have higher respiratory depression risk, and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase zolpidem levels, necessitating dose adjustments [^4c88419e] [^5e3a97db].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Routine combination of trazodone and zolpidem is **not recommended** due to additive CNS depression and limited evidence. Reserve combination therapy for refractory cases under close supervision, use the lowest effective doses, and monitor closely for adverse effects. Prefer monotherapy, CBT-I, or safer pharmacologic alternatives when possible [^55cd2f07] [^c594fa8d].

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^7f40e22a]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (ie, age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia, a common sleep–wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or both, is more prevalent among older adults and older adults are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia – including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) – can have adverse effects that may pose elevated risk for older adults. Benzodiazepine adverse effects include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction. Z-drugs are associated with next day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments and risk of dependence and addiction. Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk–benefit ratios. Clinicians often prescribe off-label the heterocyclic trazodone for insomnia management. Trazodone may be perceived as a safer alternative in older adults due to the lack of anti-cholinergic activity and cardiotoxicity, although limited published data are available to support efficacy or safety in this population. The most common adverse effects associated with trazodone use include daytime sleepiness and orthostatic hypotension, which may pose a risk of falls in an older population, particularly upon awakening from sleep. National data suggests that zolpidem and low-dose trazodone are the most frequently prescribed medications used for insomnia management in the US, followed by benzodiazepines; use of low-dose trazodone for insomnia has increased in recent years while zolpidem use has decreased.

### Real-world characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States [^3e3428f8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study sought to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States.

Methods

This real-world, retrospective, descriptive cohort study used US commercial insurance claims from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2019. The index date was the first prescription for trazodone between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, with 6 months for the preindex period and ≥6 months for the postindex period.

Findings

Among 5.8 million patients with insomnia, 17.7% were prescribed trazodone, and 357,380 adults (6.2%) and 7564 children (0.1%) met the study eligibility criteria. The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (15.8) years for adults and 14.8 (2.7) years for pediatrics. Most patients were female (229,280 adults [64.2%] and 4481 children [59.2%]). Insomnia due to mental disorder was the most common specific diagnosis. The most common (>25%) comorbid conditions were anxiety, depression, and hypertensive disease, and 1 of 10 had a history of substance abuse. Zolpidem was previously prescribed (73,342 adults [20.5%] and 233 children [3.1%]) and continued to be prescribed. Concomitant antidepressants were most common (216,893 adults [60.7%] and 5414 children [71.6%]), but benzodiazepines (132,740 adults [37.1%] and 1188 children [15.7%]), antiepileptics (115,064 adults [32.2%] and 2103 children [27.8%]), nonbenzodiazepines (90,946 adults [25.4%] and 542 children [7.2%]), and antipsychotics (40,490 adults [11.3%] and 2063 children [27.3%]) were also prescribed.

Implications

This study provides current evidence that trazodone use is widespread among patients with insomnia and is often associated with other specific comorbidities, such as psychiatric conditions. A deeper knowledge of the real-world management of patients with insomnia may facilitate steps toward improving sleep quality, daytime functioning, and clinical outcomes for patients.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^9c0e8ae7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, this national analysis of 100% Medicare claims examined outcomes for older adult patients treated with commonly prescribed medications for insomnia (ie, benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem IR, zolpidem ER). Compared with non-sleep disordered controls, treated adult patients demonstrated significantly increased risk of falls, all-cause mortality, and adverse economic outcomes. Although prescribers may perceive trazodone as a lower-risk alternative for treatment of insomnia, this study’s findings suggest that trazodone, like benzodiazepines and zolpidem, was associated with higher risk of falls and higher healthcare resource utilization compared to controls. Further, risk varied by insomnia medication, with benzodiazepines and trazodone typically being associated with the worst outcomes. Note, however, that this was an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial so the results of this study are associative rather than causal. Future research should seek to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse outcomes from commonly prescribed insomnia treatments and to match these individuals with safe, effective alternatives. Most important, these results highlight the need for insomnia treatments which are suitable for use in older adults with insomnia and are not associated with an increased risk of falls.

### Short-term clarithromycin administration impairs clearance and enhances pharmacodynamic effects of trazodone but not of zolpidem [^db807be4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

The kinetic and dynamic interactions of 5 mg zolpidem and 50 mg trazodone with 500 mg clarithromycin (4 doses given over 32 h) were investigated in a 5-way double crossover study with 10 healthy volunteers. The five treatment conditions were: placebo + placebo; zolpidem + placebo; zolpidem + clarithromycin; trazodone + placebo; and trazodone + clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin increased trazodone area under the curve, prolonged elimination half-life, increased peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and reduced oral clearance. In contrast, clarithromycin had no significant effect on any kinetic parameter for zolpidem. Clarithromycin did not potentiate sedation caused by zolpidem. However, clarithromycin coadministered with trazodone significantly increased self- and observer-rated sedation and ratings of feeling "spacey." Thus, short-term clarithromycin coadministration significantly impairs trazodone clearance, elevates plasma concentrations, and enhances sedative effects. However, clarithromycin has no significant kinetic or dynamic interaction with zolpidem.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^1e740358]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Among our 100% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, relative to non-sleep disordered controls, patients with treated insomnia demonstrated a 2.0- to 2.5-fold greater risk of falls. These results are consistent with and build upon previous studies showing a higher risk of falls among older adults treated for insomnia. In most analyses, relative to patients receiving zolpidem IR or zolpidem ER, patients receiving benzodiazepines demonstrated the greatest risk of falls, followed by patients receiving trazodone. Increased risk of falls associated with benzodiazepines and zolpidem have been extensively reported in patients with insomnia. The risk is particularly salient among older adults for whom sedative hypnotic medications are inappropriate per published guidelines. Consistent with prior reports, we found these potentially inappropriate medicines to be prescribed frequently among older adults.

### Effects on sleep stages and microarchitecture of caffeine and its combination with zolpidem or trazodone in healthy volunteers [^6e04a986]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Caffeine is the world's most popular stimulant and is known to disrupt sleep. Administration of caffeine can therefore be used in healthy volunteers to mimic the effects of insomnia and thus to test the hypnotic effects of medication. This study assessed the effects of caffeine on sleep architecture and electroencephalography (EEG) spectrum alone and in combination with two different sleep-promoting medications. Home polysomnography was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind study whereby subjects received placebo, caffeine (150 mg), caffeine plus zolpidem (10 mg) and caffeine plus trazodone (100 mg) at bedtime in a randomised crossover design. In addition to delaying sleep onset, caffeine decreased total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and stage 2 sleep without significantly altering wake after sleep onset or the number of awakenings. Zolpidem attenuated the caffeine-induced decrease in SE and increased spindle density in the caffeine plus zolpidem combination compared with placebo. Trazodone attenuated the decrease in SE and TST, and it also increased stage 3 sleep, decreased the number of awakenings and decreased the spindle density. No significant changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were observed, neither was any significant alteration in slow wave activity nor other EEG spectral measures, although the direction of change was similar to that previously reported for caffeine and appeared to 'normalise' after trazodone. These data suggest that caffeine mimics some, but not all of the sleep disruption seen in insomnia and that its disruptive effects are differentially attenuated by the actions of sleep-promoting compounds with distinct mechanisms of action.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^5d3d4207]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among older Americans. While some research has found that insomnia heightens falls, health care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs, the impact of insomnia treatments on fall risk, mortality, HCRU and costs in the elderly population, which could be of substantial interest to payers, has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated the risk of falls and related consequences among adults≥65 years of age treated with common prescription medications for insomnia compared with non-sleep disordered controls.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified Medicare claims from January 2011 through December 2017. Medicare beneficiaries treated for insomnia receiving zolpidem extended-release, zolpidem immediate-release, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were matched with non-sleep disordered controls. The main outcomes were falls, mortality, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and medical costs during the 12 months following the earliest fill date for the insomnia medication of interest. Generalized linear models controlled for several key covariates, including age, race, sex, geographic region and Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

Results

The study included 1,699,913 Medicare beneficiaries (59.9% female, mean age 75 years). Relative to controls, adjusted analyses showed that beneficiaries receiving insomnia medication experienced over twice as many falls (odds ratio [OR]=2.34, 95% CI: 2.31-2.36). In adjusted analyses, patients receiving benzodiazepines or trazodone had the greatest risk. Crude all-cause mortality rates were 15-times as high for the insomnia-treated as controls. Compared with controls, beneficiaries receiving insomnia treatment demonstrated higher estimated adjusted mean number of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits and longer length of inpatient stay. All-cause total adjusted mean costs were higher among insomnia treated patients ($967 vs $454).

Conclusions

Individuals receiving insomnia treatment had an increased risk of falls and mortality and higher HCRU and costs compared with matched beneficiaries without sleep disorders. Trazodone and benzodiazepines were associated with the greatest risk of falls. This analysis suggests that significant risks are associated with common, older generation insomnia medication treatments in the elderly. Nonetheless, these results should be interpreted with caution as the use of these medications may be indicative of underlying morbidity with potential for residual confounding.

### Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation and the risk of fall-related fractures among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^a8605d19]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and trazodone, a sedating antidepressant, are the most common medications used to treat insomnia in the United States. Both drugs have side effect profiles ( e.g ., drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive and motor impairment) that can heighten the risk of falls and fractures. Despite widespread zolpidem and trazodone use, little is known about the comparative safety of these medications in patients receiving hemodialysis, a vulnerable population with an exceedingly high fracture rate.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Using data from the United States Renal Data System registry (2013-2016), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the initiation of zolpidem versus trazodone therapy and the 30-day risk of hospitalized fall-related fractures among Medicare-enrolled patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We used an active comparator new-user design and estimated 30-day inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios and risk differences. We treated death as a competing event.

Results

A total of 31,055 patients were included: 18,941 zolpidem initiators (61%) and 12,114 trazodone initiators (39%). During the 30-day follow-up period, 101 fall-related fractures occurred. Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation was associated with a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture (weighted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.63; weighted risk difference, 0.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.07% to 0.29%). This association was more pronounced among individuals prescribed higher zolpidem doses (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 3.01; and risk difference, 0.20%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04% to 0.38% for higher-dose zolpidem versus trazodone; and hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.55 and risk difference, 0.14%; 95% confidence interval, 0.03% to 0.27% for lower-dose zolpidem versus trazodone). Sensitivity analyses using longer follow-up durations yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis, zolpidem initiators had a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture compared with trazodone initiators.

### Treatment of insomnia in hospitalized patients [^95275384]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the short-term management of insomnia in hospitalized patients and review patient assessment, nonpharmacologic treatment modalities, and selection of hypnotic medications.

Data Sources

Review articles and primary literature representative of current knowledge regarding the treatment of insomnia were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-January 2001). Search terms included insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance disorders), benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and trazodone.

Data Synthesis

Literature regarding the management of insomnia in hospitalized patients is limited; therefore, data pertinent to the treatment of ambulatory patients must be extrapolated to the inpatient setting. When evaluating insomnia in hospitalized patients, it seems reasonable to obtain a thorough history and physical examination to identify potential underlying etiologies. Treatment of these underlying etiologies should be considered. When the use of a sedative-hypnotic agent is necessary, medication and dose selection should be based on the pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles of each agent. Patent-specific characteristics should also be considered to provide effective treatment while minimizing adverse effects.

Conclusions

Nonpharmacologic approaches to the treatment of insomnia should be considered for hospitalized patients. When sedative-hypnotic medications must be administered, the pharmacokinetic profile of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, temazepam) makes them good first-line agents. Zaleplon and zolpidem are also attractive hypnotic agents; however, they are typically reserved for second-line therapy due to cost. Trazodone may be an alternative for patients unable to take benzodiazepines.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^55cd2f07]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

AASM clinical practice guideline—pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia in adults frames the clinical question using a PICO approach in adult patients diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia, comparing pharmacologic interventions to placebo control with outcomes sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), quality of sleep (QOS), sleep efficiency (SE), and number of awakenings (NOA). Interventions considered include Diphenhydramine, Doxepin, Eszopiclone, Melatonin, Ramelteon, Suvorexant, Temazepam, Tiagabine, Trazodone, Triazolam, Tryptophan, Valerian + hops, Zaleplon, and Zolpidem, and the PICO question is stated as, “In adult patients diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia, how does [intervention] improve [outcomes], compared to placebo?”. Footnotes clarify approval status: “* = FDA-approved, indicated for the treatment of insomnia. ** = FDA-approved, off-label usage for the treatment of insomnia. † = Over-the-counter medication.”

### Prescription medications for the treatment of insomnia and risk of suicide attempt: a comparative safety study [^de538037]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of chronic insomnia in adults recognize that trazodone and other off-label medications are commonly prescribed despite poor evidence. The Department of Veterans Health Affairs (VA) fills high volumes of inexpensive, over-the-counter sedating antihistamines and older antidepressants in addition to benzodiazepines and zolpidem. Yet little is known about the comparative safety of these agents with regard to suicidal behavior.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effectiveness of the safety of medications routinely used to treat insomnia in VA.

Design

Comparative effectiveness using propensity score-matched samples.

Setting

VA.

Participants

VA patients without any history of suicidal ideation or behavior 12 months prior to first exposure.

Exposures

VA formularies and data were used to identify prescriptions for insomnia. Agents accounting for at least 1% of total insomnia fill volume were <200 mg trazodone, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, zolpidem, lorazepam, diazepam, and temazepam. Exposure was defined as an incident monotherapy exposure preceded by 12 months without any insomnia medications. Subjects with insomnia polypharmacy or cross-overs in the 12 months following first exposure were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Suicide attempts within 12 months of first exposure.

Results

Three hundred forty-eight thousand four hundred forty-nine subjects met criteria and three well-balanced cohorts by drug class matched to zolpidem were created. After adjusting for days' supply, mental health history, and pain and central nervous system medication history, hazard ratios (compared to zolpidem) were as follows: (<200 mg) trazodone (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.43); sedating antihistamines (HR=1.37, 95% CI 0.90-2.07); and benzodiazepines (HR=1.31, 95% CI 0.85-2.08).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared to zolpidem, hazard of suicide attempt was 61% higher with trazodone (<200 mg). No significant differences in suicide attempt risk were identified between benzodiazepines or sedating antihistamines and zolpidem, respectively. These findings provide the first comparative effectiveness evidence against the use of trazodone for insomnia.

Fall outcomes

Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, patients with treated insomnia were more likely to have experienced ≥ 1 fall events in the 12 months post-index (9.4 vs 3.1%; Fig. 1). Among the insomnia treated cohort, a greater proportion of patients receiving benzodiazepines (11.3%) or trazodone (9.5%) experienced a fall event relative to the proportions of patients receiving zolpidem IR (7.7%) or zolpidem ER (6.0%).

Percentage of patients with 1 + falls in the overall and stratified insomnia treated and matched control cohorts

Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, beneficiaries with treated insomnia with ≥ 1 falls experienced more falls per enrollee (2.0 [SD 2.2] vs. 1.6 [SD 1.7]). This pattern was consistent across all individual insomnia treatments studied. The mean number of fall events per patient with one or more falls was highest among patients receiving trazodone. The mean time to first fall in patients with one or more fall event was 154.2 days (SD 111.8) in the insomnia treated group (n = 160,465) and 176.1 days (SD 107.9) in the matched control group (n = 53,011).

Among patients with treated insomnia, the adjusted incident rate (IR) for a fall event was 9.2 per 100 person years (PY; 95% CI 9.1 to 9.3); among controls this IR was 4.1 per 100 PY (95% CI 4.0 to 4.1). Among patients with treated insomnia, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for a fall event was 2.26 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.3). Relative to the matched control cohort, fall events were more common in each treatment cohort studied. Relative to the adjusted IR for patients receiving zolpidem IR (8.2 per 100 PY) or zolpidem ER (7.2 per 100 PY), the adjusted IR was higher for patients receiving benzodiazepines (10.0 per 100 PY) or trazodone (9.8 per 100 PY).

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^73c296e5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias—pharmacological options for insomnia include trazodone and hypnotics with specified dosing, with cautions and agents not recommended; some clinicians prefer 25–100 mg of trazodone at bedtime for sleep disturbances, whereas others prefer the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as zolpidem (5–10 mg at bedtime) or zaleplon (5–10 mg at bedtime); benzodiazepines (e.g., 0.5–1.0 mg of lorazepam, 7.5–15.0 mg of oxazepam) may be used, but these agents are generally recommended only for short-term sleep problems because of the possibility of tolerance, daytime sleepiness, rebound insomnia, worsening cognition, falls, disinhibition, and delirium; rebound insomnia and daytime sleepiness can occur with any of these agents; triazolam is not recommended for individuals with dementia because of its association with amnesia; diphenhydramine is used by some clinicians, but it is not recommended for the treatment of patients with dementia because of its anticholinergic properties.

Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, the OR for a fall event in the overall insomnia treated cohort was 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.4)) (Fig. 2 A). Relative to the control cohort, the HR for the first fall after the index date for the overall insomnia treated cohort was 2.3 (95% CI: 2.23, 2.3) (Fig. 2 B). Each value was highest among patients receiving benzodiazepines followed by trazodone. Note that OR and HR patterns for overall treatment group and specific medications were quite similar.

Mortality

Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, beneficiaries with treated insomnia were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality in the 12 months post-index (0.3% vs 0.02%; p < 0.001). Among beneficiaries with treated insomnia who experienced a fall event, relative to non-sleep disordered controls, all-cause mortality was significantly more likely (prevalence 0.9% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001).

Patients receiving zolpidem ER, zolpidem IR, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality, relative to the respective controls (all p < 0.001). Among individuals who experienced falls, relative to non-sleep-disordered controls, patients receiving zolpidem IR, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality (p < 0.001). Further, in this population, all-cause mortality was greater among patients receiving trazodone (0.4%) than among patients receiving benzodiazepines (0.3%), zolpidem IR (0.3%) or zolpidem ER (0.2%).

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^ec41abca]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

Results

Patient demographics and characteristics

After matching, 1,699,913 patients were included in each cohort (Supplementary Fig. 1). Among the insomnia treated cohort, the proportion of patients receiving each index treatment was zolpidem IR 36.2%, trazodone 34.2%, benzodiazepines 29.1%, and zolpidem ER 0.5%.

After matching, the insomnia treated and matched control cohorts had the same sex distribution and age at index (Table 1). Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, patients with treated insomnia had a substantially higher comorbidity burden (mean CCI (1.7 [SD 2.5]) vs (0.7 [SD 1.5]). In addition, patients with treated insomnia demonstrated a slightly shorter mean duration of post-index Medicare enrollment (41 months [SD 17.3] vs 44 months [SD 17.0]). No other differences in demographic or clinical characteristics were observed (Table 1).

At post2, further improvements were observed for fatigue (mean MFI score change: zolpidem plus BT, −3.8 [95% CI, −7.1 to −0.4]; d = 0.36; zolpidem plus trazodone, −3.7 [95% CI, −6.3 to −1.1]; d = 0.46), functional impairments (mean WSAS score change: zolpidem plus BT, −3.7 [95% CI, −6.4 to −1.0]; d = 0.62; zolpidem plus trazodone, −3.3 [95% CI, −5.9 to −0.7]; d = 0.55) and the SF-36 mental health subscale (mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.7-7.9]; d = 0.91; zolpidem plus trazodone, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.1-4.0]; d = 0.35) in treatment sequences starting with zolpidem, while for depression symptoms, only the zolpidem plus BT sequence showed significant improvements (mean BDI-II score change, −2.8 [95% CI, −4.9 to −0.6]; d = 0.71) (Table 2). No additional changes were observed in the 2 sequences starting with BT at post2, except for functional impairments (mean WSAS score change: BT plus CT, −2.6 [95% CI, −4.4 to −0.7]; d = 43). The comparisons of the 4 sequences yielded a significant overall effect only for the SF-36 mental health subscale at post 2 (eTable in Supplement 2), with both conditions starting with zolpidem showing higher scores on the SF-36 mental health subscale.

### NCT04468776 | CBT-I or zolpidem / trazodone for insomnia (...) [^8fca280a]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Medications and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy for insomnia are both effective for treating insomnia. Zolpidem, the most frequently prescribed insomnia medication, is widely available, but may cause side effects and dependency. Trazodone is increasingly prescribed off-label for treatment of insomnia, but evidence of efficacy and safety is more limited. To address these questions, we propose the study, Comparative Effectiveness of Zolpidem/Trazodone and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Rural Adults. The investigators will use a well-tested Internet version of CBT-I, which is just as effective as in-person CBT-I, but more widely available. The aims of COZI are to: 1: Compare the effectiveness of medication preference, CBT-I, and combination treatment for insomnia symptoms over 6 months.

2: Compare the effectiveness of medication preference, CBT-I, and combination treatment for other symptoms and problems, including health-related quality of life, mood, and health outcomes. 3: Compare the side effects of medication preference, CBT-I, and combination treatment. COZI will study 155 patients recruited from 7 health care systems across the country, each of which has established practices in rural areas. Patients will be treated with medication prescribed by their own physician, Internet CBT-I, or a combination of the two. The investigators will evaluate treatment effects at 9 weeks, and 6 and 12 months. Our study questions and design reflect early and ongoing engagement of key stakeholders including patients, providers, and payors, who are members of the Study Advisory Committee.

### Hypnotics in insomnia: the experience of zolpidem [^61544342]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

One of the most commonly prescribed medications to treat insomnia is zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine compound that is available as an immediate-release oral tablet formulation, an extended-release oral formulation, an oral spray formulation, and as sublingual formulations. The purpose of this review was to summarize the data currently available on the efficacy and safety of zolpidem in the treatment of insomnia among adults.

Methods

Published studies on the use of zolpidem in the treatment of insomnia were identified by using combinations of relevant search terms in PubMed and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they were placebo- or active comparator-controlled studies, with the exception of trials on the long-term use of zolpidem. Studies were limited to those conducted in adults. Studies were not included if the patient population was small, if the study was not designed or powered to assess the efficacy or safety of zolpidem, if insomniac patients had a medical condition in addition to insomnia (with the exception of comorbid depression or anxiety for studies on comorbid insomnia), or if zolpidem was given concomitantly with any other therapy (with the exception of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for studies on comorbid insomnia).

Findings

Twenty-five studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of zolpidem in insomnia and 51 studies reporting the safety of zolpidem in insomnia were included in this review.

Implications

The studies discussed in this review report the efficacy and safety of zolpidem in both young adults and the elderly. It can be used for either bedtime or middle-of-the-night administration, over the short or long term, with minimal risk of withdrawal or abuse. The use of zolpidem is associated with rebound insomnia, complex sleep-related behaviors, and next-day residual effects (after middle-of-the-night dosing) on driving ability, memory, and psychomotor performance.

5.1 Complex Sleep Behaviors

Complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake, may occur following the first or any subsequent use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events. Postmarketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets alone at recommended doses, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants [see Drug Interaction (7.1)]. Discontinue Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior [see Contraindications (4)].

### Effectiveness of sequential psychological and medication therapies for insomnia disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^81ba2a61]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Despite evidence of efficacious psychological and pharmacologic therapies for insomnia, there is little information about what first-line treatment should be and how best to proceed when initial treatment fails.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative efficacy of 4 treatment sequences involving psychological and medication therapies for insomnia and examine the moderating effect of psychiatric disorders on insomnia outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, patients were assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT; n=104) or zolpidem (zolpidem; n=107), and patients who did not remit received a second treatment involving either medication (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy [CT]). The study took place at Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Québec, Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, and at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, and enrollment of patients took place from August 2012 through July 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end points were the treatment response and remission rates, defined by the Insomnia Severity Index total score.

Results

Patients included 211 adults (132 women; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years) with a chronic insomnia disorder, including 74 patients with a comorbid anxiety or mood disorder. First-stage therapy with BT or zolpidem produced equivalent weighted percentages of responders (BT, 45.5%; zolpidem, 49.7%; OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.60-2.33) and remitters (BT, 38.03%; zolpidem, 30.3%; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.75-2.65). Second-stage therapy produced significant increases in responders for the 2 conditions, starting with BT (BT to zolpidem, 40.6% to 62.7%; OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.14-5.30; BT to CT, 50.1% to 68.2%; OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.01-4.35) but no significant change following zolpidem treatment. Significant increase in percentage of remitters was observed in 2 of 4 therapy sequences (BT to zolpidem, 38.1% to 55.9%; OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.04-4.11; zolpidem to trazodone, 31.4% to 49.4%; OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 0.91-5.00). Although response/remission rates were lower among patients with psychiatric comorbidity, treatment sequences that involved BT followed by CT or zolpidem followed by trazodone yielded better outcomes for patients with comorbid insomnia. Response and remission rates were well sustained through the 12-month follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

Behavioral therapy and zolpidem medication produced equivalent response and remission rates. Adding a second treatment produced an added value for those whose insomnia failed to remit with initial therapies.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^29880649]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of Insomnia Disorder with Low-Dose Antidepressants

Insomnia belongs to the most frequent disorders of the brain. In industrialized countries, approximately 6% of the adults suffer from insomnia as a disorder and as many as 50% may suffer from transient insomnia symptoms [•]. Although insomnia is not regarded as a severe mental disorder, it shares many features with depression. In order to offer a patient an effective treatment of insomnia, there is a need for a broader perspective, one that reaches far beyond the prescription of hypnotics. Current treatment guidelines [••] strongly recommend the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder and only short-term use of the sleep-promoting drugs in patients with insufficient response to CBI-I. However, in daily clinical practice, the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia is very common. The most frequently used drugs to treat insomnia aside from benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine (eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) hypnotics are sedative antidepressants. However, due to the lack of methodologically sound randomized clinical trials in insomnia, only one of them, doxepin, is approved by FDA for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Furthermore, recent recommendations discourage the use of other drugs from this class than doxepin for the insomnia treatment [••]. In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option of insomnia in a situation in which despite being in CBT-I therapy, the patient still requires sleep-promoting drugs more than 3–4 times per week. The use of sedative antidepressants should be also considered when there is a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder because such patients are at increased risk of developing hypnotic dependency. Moreover, in many insomnia patients, physiological parameters, e.g. hormone secretion, whole body, and brain metabolic rate, are altered in a similar fashion to the depressed ones what is called a hyperarousal, supporting the use of sedative antidepressants to treat such patients. The pros and cons of using sedative antidepressants in insomnia patients were discussed extensively in the earlier papers. This is especially true for trazodone that is very often used as a sleep-promoting drug [,–]. Frequently expressed concern with the usage of sedative antidepressants in insomnia is that their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be underrated. Indeed, although there is evidence for efficacy of sedative antidepressants to promote sleep, for example for TCA in a form of a recent meta-analytic study [•], it is important to remember that these drugs should be used in insomnia patients only in a very low dose, e.g. for doxepin as low as 3 to 6 mg or 25–50 mg for trazodone. Many psychiatrists are astonished that a sedative antidepressant can promote sleep in such a low dose. Firstly, it should be noted that such low doses are appropriate only for patients with primary insomnia. In the presence of a comorbid mood disorder, the antidepressants have to be used in a recommended therapeutic dose. Secondly, such treatment should be used only when combined with behavioral interventions from CBT-I protocol. When a patient restricts time in bed and uses stimulus control technique, even low-dosage pharmacological treatment starts to work. Thirdly, to be effective in treating sleep-onset insomnia, sedative antidepressants have to be taken much earlier than hypnotics in regard to their pharmacokinetics, especially the time they take to reach the maximum serum concentration (Cmax). It usually means at least 2 hours before sleep (in the case of more rapid drug action the patient should be encouraged to shorten this time). In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a safe class of drugs when given in low doses. We use them in many patient groups where hypnotics are contraindicated, e.g. in the elderly patients, in patients with sleep apnea and in patients with a history of alcohol and substance abuse. Despite the fact that the use of atypical antipsychotics, mostly quetiapine, is increasing for treatment of insomnia accompanying bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we hold the conviction that sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option for such patients as well. Based on our clinical experience and review of published case reports, we believe that the use of sedative antidepressants in a low dose is not related to the increased risk of phase shift in bipolar disorder. Moreover, we have observed that for the treatment of insomnia low doses (5–10 mg) of citalopram administered in the morning can be an alternative to sedative antidepressants with good treatment effects.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^76742d50]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Daytime functional impairments are the primary reasons for patients with insomnia to seek treatment, yet little is known about what the optimal treatment is for improving daytime functions and how best to proceed with treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy (BT) and zolpidem as initial therapies for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia and evaluate the added value of a second treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this sequential multiple-assignment randomized clinical trial conducted at institutions in Canada and the US, 211 adults with chronic insomnia disorder were enrolled between May 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015, and followed up for 12 months. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis in April and October 2023.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to either BT or zolpidem as first-stage therapy, and those whose insomnia had not remitted received a second-stage psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy) or medication therapy (zolpidem or trazodone).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Study outcomes were daytime symptoms of insomnia, including mood disturbances, fatigue, functional impairments of insomnia, and scores on the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical and mental health components.

Results

Among 211 adults with insomnia (132 women [63%]; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years), 104 were allocated to BT and 107 to zolpidem at the first stage. First-stage treatment with BT or zolpidem yielded significant and equivalent benefits for most of the daytime outcomes, including depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II mean score change, -3.5 [95% CI, -4.7 to -2.3] vs -4.3 [95% CI, -5.7 to -2.9]), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change, -4.7 [95% CI, -7.3 to -2.2] vs -5.2 [95% CI, -7.9 to -2.5]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change, -5.0 [95% CI, -6.7 to -3.3] vs -5.1 [95% CI, -7.2 to -2.9]), and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.9-5.1] vs 2.5 [95% CI, 0.4-4.5]), while BT produced larger improvements for anxiety symptoms relative to zolpidem (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory mean score change, -4.1 [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.4] vs -1.2 [95% CI, -3.0 to 0.5]; P=.02; Cohen d=0.55). Second-stage therapy produced additional improvements for the 2 conditions starting with zolpidem at posttreatment in fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.8 [95% CI, -7.1 to -0.4]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.4 to -1.0]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.3 [95% CI, -5.9 to -0.7]) and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.7-7.9]; zolpidem plus trazodone, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.1-4.0]). Treatment benefits achieved at posttreatment were well maintained throughout the 12-month follow-up, and additional improvements were noted for patients receiving the BT treatment sequences.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of adults with insomnia disorder, BT and zolpidem produced improvements for various daytime symptoms of insomnia that were no different between treatments. Adding a second treatment offered an added value with further improvements of daytime functions.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^9cd3e021]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Clean-up phase

The clean-up phase (Figure 3) follows the following principles:

Cognitive enhancers (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine) should not be discontinued unless there is evidence that their introduction may have caused the BPSD symptoms (e.g. as may occur in the frontal variant of Alzheimer’s disease). Optimization of these drugs is a parallel process to initiation of drugs specifically for treatment of agitation and aggression in BPSD and is therefore not part of the main drug treatment pathway. However, it is recommended that while working through the main pathway prescribers should avoid introducing new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine to permit assessment of the effects of pathway drugs.
Antipsychotics, antidepressants (including trazodone), carbamazepine, gabapentin, prazosin and cyproterone acetate should be discontinued if these drugs had been started specifically for BPSD, but not if started for another clinical indication (e.g. depression, schizophrenia). Where discontinuation is required, this should be undertaken from day 3 to day 10.
Benzodiazepines or “Z-drugs” (e.g. zopiclone, zolpidem) should be discontinued unless there is clear recent evidence of insurmountable difficulty in stopping them. Where discontinuation is indicated, it should be undertaken as slowly as needed for safety, which in many cases will necessitate a gradual taper with the down-titration process continuing beyond day 10.
During the clean-up period (and afterwards), the PRN psychotropic drugs described in the section on ‘Drugs included for PRN use’ above may be used, either (a) trazodone 25 mg every hour as needed, maximum initially 150 mg/24 h with option to increase to a maximum of 300 mg/day if required in non-FRAIL patients, or (b) lorazepam 0.5 mg as needed, max 2 mg/24 h. As per above, trazodone is the preferred choice whereas lorazepam is recommended only in specific circumstances.

At the end of the clean-up phase, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) (compared with baseline), CGI-S and NPI-Q are performed (Table 2). In a substantial minority of cases, the clean-up phase in an inpatient setting may produce adequate improvement (normally reflected through a CGI-I score of one or two), obviating the need to enter the main drug treatment pathway.

### Association of benzodiazepine treatment for sleep disorders with drug overdose risk among young people [^6b0a5f22]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for the treatment of adolescent sleep disorders; however, benzodiazepine overdoses occur, often in combination with opioids.

Objective

To evaluate whether benzodiazepine treatment for sleep disorders, compared with alternative pharmacologic treatments (trazodone, hydroxyzine, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), is associated with increased risk of drug overdose for young people.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included privately insured people 10 to 29 years of age identified from a US commercial claims database (MarketScan), from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018. Young people with a sleep disorder diagnosis initiating benzodiazepine (n=23 084) or comparator pharmacologic treatments (n=66 706) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed from November 1, 2021, to May 16, 2022.

Exposures

New use of benzodiazepine treatment or comparator pharmacologic treatments (defined as ≥1 year without a prescription for benzodiazepine or comparator medications).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident diagnosed drug overdoses were identified from inpatient and emergency department records within 6 months of treatment initiation. The propensity score-adjusted cumulative incidence of overdose and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with intention-to-treat (analyzed based on initial treatment) and as-treated analyses (added censoring at treatment discontinuation). Results were stratified by prior prescription opioid fill.

Results

The cohort included 23 084 young people initiating benzodiazepine treatment (14 444 female participants [62.6%]; mean [SD] age, 23 [4.1] years) and 66 706 initiating a comparator treatment (38 446 female participants [57.6%]; mean [SD] age, 22 [4.4] years). Six months after treatment initiation, 9.7% (95% CI, 9.3%-10.1%) of benzodiazepine users and 12.3% (95% CI, 12.1%-12.6%) of the comparator group were still receiving treatment. The crude incidence of drug overdose at 6 months was 0.9% for benzodiazepine initiators and 0.8% for comparator treatment initiators. In adjusted analyses, an increased risk of drug overdose was associated with benzodiazepines vs comparator treatments (intention-to-treat analysis: HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.03-1.51]; as-treated analysis: HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.14-1.80]). This association was stronger among young people with a recent prescription opioid fill vs those without a recent prescription opioid fill (as-treated analysis: adjusted HR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.24-3.25] vs adjusted HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.00-1.70]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that benzodiazepines, compared with alternative pharmacologic treatments for common sleep disorders, were associated with an increased risk of drug overdose among young people during the following 6-month period, especially among those with a recent opioid prescription. Drug overdose is an important safety consideration when treating young people with benzodiazepines.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^8a7d1c8f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

In summary, the pervasiveness and consistency of the observed trazodone effects, especially after considering disease severity and concomitant medication use, encourages further investigation into its effectiveness on preserving cognition via sleep-wake rhythm consolidation. Implications on clinical practice involve improving quality of life for patients who experience sleep disturbances that, if untreated, may promote future amyloid- β deposition. Furthermore, potential cognitive benefits of trazodone may be applicable to both cognitively intact older adults and mildly impaired patients with dementia. The effectiveness of trazodone, possibly achieved by decreasing amyloid- β aggregation and pathologic tau burden, as well as by improving sleep-mediated memory consolidation, can be further explored through controlled clinical trials.

Zolpidem—total sleep time (TST) effects show mixed PSG and subjective outcomes with low certainty. For PSG-determined TST, two studies were meta-analyzed with a mean reduction of −28.91 min and a 95% CI of +10.85 to +46.97 min; the quality of evidence was downgraded to LOW due to imprecision and potential publication bias. For patient-reported TST, eight studies showed a mean difference of +30.04 min (CI: +15.12 to +44.96 min) with quality of evidence rated low. Additional studies not included in the meta-analysis found a statistically significantly greater increase in subjective TST versus placebo of +19.9 min when only drug nights were analyzed, and nightly versus intermittent (5/7 nights) zolpidem 10 mg produced numerical improvements of +11.3 and +16.9 min with no difference between schedules.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

The study cohort was identified from the 2009-2018 MarketScan US commercial claims database, which includes patient-level records on insurance enrollment details; dispensed prescription medications; and inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED) health care encounters.The study population included privately insured young people aged 10 to 29 years. We identified young people with a sleep disorder diagnosis newly initiating benzodiazepine treatment or an alternative pharmacologic treatment. New use was defined with a 1-year washout period without a prior benzodiazepine prescription, an alternative pharmacologic treatment (sedative-hypnotic Z-drugs [ie, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone], hydroxyzine, trazodone), or clonidine. Clonidine, which is often used for sleep disorders in younger adolescents, was included in the washout period but was not included as an alternative pharmacologic treatment given its infrequent use for insomnia among young adults. Continuous insurance enrollment with prescription drug coverage was required in the prior year. The Rutgers University institutional review board approved this study under expedited review. A waiver of consent was granted because the data were deidentified. Our report followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for observational studies.

We required a diagnosis of insomnia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes 307.41, 307.42, 327.0x, and 780.52; International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] codes F51.0x and G47.0x) or unspecified sleep disorder (ICD-9-CM codes 307.40 and 780.50; ICD-10-CM codes F51.9x and G47.9x) (hereafter referred to as sleep disorders) 30 or less days prior to treatment initiation. Additional cohort exclusions included clinical contraindications (eg, sleep apnea), epilepsy diagnosis, combination treatments, trazodone initiation at higher doses, and initiating treatment with 1 or more medication classes (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

### Zolpidem tartrate (zolpidem) [^c36098a1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets, like other sedative-hypnotic drugs, has CNS-depressant effects. Coadministration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression [see Drug Interaction (7.1)]. Dosage adjustments of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and of other concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects. The use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets with other sedative-hypnotics (including other zolpidem products) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]

The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving, is increased if Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if a higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants or alcohol; or if coadministered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem. Patients should be warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is taken in these circumstances [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Studies (14.3)]

Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that, as with other hypnotics, there may be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness, prolonged reaction time, dizziness, sleepiness, blurred/double vision, reduced alertness, and impaired driving the morning after therapy. In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep (7–8 hours) is recommended.

Because Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions

Inform patients that severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with zolpidem. Describe the signs/symptoms of these reactions and advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if any of them occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

Suicide

Tell patients to immediately report any suicidal thoughts.

Alcohol and other Drugs

Ask patients about alcohol consumption, medicines they are taking, and drugs they may be taking without a prescription. Advise patients not to use zolpidem tartrate tablets if they drank alcohol that evening or before bed.

Concomitant Use with Opioids 

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially serious additive effects may occur if zolpidem tartrate tablets is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.7), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Tolerance, Abuse, and Dependence

Tell patients not to increase the dose of zolpidem tartrate tablets on their own, and to inform you if they believe the drug "does not work".

Administration Instructions

Patients should be counseled to take zolpidem tartrate tablets right before they get into bed and only when they are able to stay in bed a full night (7 to 8 hours) before being active again. Zolpidem tartrate tablets should not be taken with or immediately after a meal. Advise patients NOT to take zolpidem tartrate tablets if they drank alcohol that evening.

### The utility of polysomnography for the diagnosis of NREM parasomnias: an observational study over 4 years of clinical practice [^d5d4246f]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

For some patients in our study, no episodes were recorded even during longer admissions. Home video-recording has recently been also shown to be an alternative, useful tool on some occasions, in particular for people with questionable or inconclusive PSG or where no episodes are recorded in hospital, helping in appreciating the severity of the episodes and for ruling out stereotyped behaviours.

NREM parasomnia episodes can be precipitated by external and internal factors in predisposed individuals. In general, any factor that increases the proportion of SWS (sleep deprivation or substances use) or sleep fragmentation with frequent arousals can facilitate events.

Obstructive respiratory events and PLMS have been reported in NREM parasomnia patients as potential precipitating factors often causing arousal or sleep disruption.

We found that, such comorbidities are not an infrequent finding in adult patients evaluated for NREM parasomnia (21 %) even in apparently asymptomatic patients.

Hence, the concomitant occurrence of PLMS or obstructive respiratory events in this group of people should not be underestimated, but their presence should be sought by routine monitoring of leg EMG channels and respiratory parameters.

Pharmacological treatment for NREM parasomnia is usually not necessary for typical, infrequent and non-injurious episodes. On the other hand, treatment may be required for people in whom the episodes cause discomfort or distress, such as excessive day-time somnolence or injuries to themselves or bed-partner.

The most widely used drugs for treatment of NREM parasomnia, when needed, are benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (i.e. clonazepam, diazepam, triazolam, zolpidem, etc.), tricyclics antidepressants (i.e. imipramine) and SSRIs (i.e. paroxetine, trazodone).

Daytime Functional Outcomes

Table 2 shows adjusted mean (SE) values for psychological and daytime functional outcomes. Significant reduction in anxiety symptoms (STAI-Trait) was made with BT after first-stage treatment (mean change, −4.1 [95% CI, −5.8 to −2.4]; Cohen d = 0.79), but not with zolpidem therapy (−1.2 [95% CI, −3.0 to 0.5]; d = 0.24), and the difference between changes was significant (P =.02; d = 0.55) (eTable in Supplement 2). At post2, a further reduction of anxiety was observed in both conditions starting with zolpidem (mean change: zolpidem plus BT, −4.4 [95% CI, –7.5 to –1.2]; d = 0.85; zolpidem plus trazodone, −1.8 [95% CI, –3.4 to −0.3]; d = 0.36), while no change was observed in the sequences starting with BT. Comparisons for post1 to post2 changes of the 4 sequences at post2 was significant for STAI-Trait score (eTable in Supplement 2).

Trazodone 50 mg—primary insomnia efficacy and harms: A single study of trazodone 50 mg met inclusion criteria with no meta-analysis available and the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to potential publication bias; patient-reported outcomes showed a modest reduction in sleep latency below the clinical significance threshold, while increases in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset did not reach clinical thresholds, quality of sleep was not significantly improved, and reductions in number of awakenings fell just below clinical significance, so none of the sleep outcome variables improved to a clinically significant degree. There was no meta-analysis of harms; in the Walsh study the trazodone group experienced significantly more side effects than placebo, with headache 30% versus 19% and somnolence 23% versus 8%, and overall adverse events in 75% of trazodone subjects compared to 65.4% with placebo. Given the absence of demonstrated efficacy on numerous critical outcomes and limited harms data, the task force judged the harms to potentially outweigh the benefits, yet determined that the majority of patients would be likely to use trazodone compared to no treatment.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^ad44145c]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

As for pharmacotherapy, there is limited evidence to support current practices for insomnia for dialysis patients. Notwithstanding clinical practice guidelines, pharmacotherapy is widely used as a first-line therapy for insomnia including HD patients; it is also an alternative for patients unwilling to engage with CBT-I or for whom CBT-I is unavailable or inaccessible. However, the drugs used widely have either concerns about safety or efficacy, or have been insufficiently studied for patients undergoing HD. Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonists such as zolpidem are prescribed for 8–26% of HD patients even though two cohort studies have shown that HD patients treated with these drug classes have a significantly higher risk for death. Trazodone is an attractive option as population surveys show it to be the most common or second most common drug prescribed for insomnia in the United States for HD patients, yet is remarkably understudied. The drug is metabolized in the liver into inactive metabolites and no dose adjustments are necessary with kidney disease. However, there are limited data to guide clinical practice. Low-quality evidence suggests its efficacy for treating primary insomnia; in two placebo-controlled trials, treatment with trazodone lasted only 7–14 days, and the only trial testing its efficacy as add-on to CBT-I enrolled just 20 patients. Studies have shown the efficacy of trazodone for insomnia in patients with depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and alcohol/opiate dependence. However, no studies have tested its efficacy and safety in the setting of partial correction of uremia as with HD and none are underway. Furthermore, HD patients have unique behavioral and scheduling challenges and have greater risk with daytime sleepiness when overlaid upon hemodynamic fluctuations with HD and frailty. This study will generate much-needed evidence to support or refute its widespread use for treating insomnia in HD patients.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^40fb0d85]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic sleep aids—melatonin, ramelteon, trazodone, and antihistamines: Although melatonin is the first choice of psychiatrists for the treatment of insomnia in athletes, research investigating its use for primary insomnia is inconclusive; there is no evidence that melatonin is effective in the management of most primary sleep disorders with short-term use, though short-term use appears safe and it was not shown to improve sleep quality in athletes the next morning after ingestion. Exogenous melatonin is not regulated by the FDA, so elite athletes in drug testing programs must use this OTC supplement with caution because purity cannot be guaranteed. The melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon carries a longer half-life than melatonin with a greater likelihood of hangover effects and has not been studied in athletes. Trazodone is commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia; no studies have been performed in athletes, and one RCT versus zolpidem and placebo found no significant efficacy for trazodone and more side effects such as headache and somnolence. First-generation antihistamines are most often used for their sedating effect and longer duration of action, but there is weak evidence showing absence of efficacy for sleep onset insomnia and minimal evidence of adverse events beyond placebo.

Types of interventions

We will include studies comparing MC versus placebo or non‐MC drugs in people with insomnia.

We plan to investigate the following comparisons of intervention versus comparator.

Intervention

MC such as the following.

Licenced medical drugs: plant‐based cannabinoids (combined THC and CBD (nabiximols (Sativex)) or oral CBD only (Epidiolex)); synthetic cannabinoids (nabilone (Cesamet or Canemes) or dronabinol (Marinol or Syndros), both synthetic THC).
Magistral preparations of cannabis plant derivatives: plant‐derived THC or plant‐derived CBD; herbal cannabis, resins, and extracts with a defined content of THC or CBD (or both), together with other active ingredients (phytocannabinoids other than CBD/THC, such as terpenes and flavonoids).

We will include these interventions administered at any dose, at any combination or by any route.

Although the distinction between medical and recreational cannabis is primarily regulatory rather than pharmacological, for this review, we define medical cannabis as any cannabis‐derived product used for therapeutic purposes. This includes all the interventions described previously.

We will exclude experimental and unregistered drugs, including cannabis receptor antagonists and negative allosteric modulators like rimonabant, as well as modulators that enhance endocannabinoid system activity, such as fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors, and synthetic cannabis like levonantradol.

Comparator

Placebo
Benzodiazepine receptor agonists: zopiclone, eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplone
Benzodiazepines: short‐, intermediate‐ or long‐acting such as diazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, lormetazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam
Melatonin receptor agonist: fast‐release melatonin, ramelteon or prolonged‐release melatonin
Antidepressants: amitriptyline, doxepin, mirtazapine, trazadone
Antipsychotics: levomepromazine, quetiapine, olanzapine, chlorprothixene, melperone, pipamperone, prothipendyl

We will include comparisons of any drugs that allow for double‐blind treatment. We will consider treatments administered in an outpatient setting in any formulation. We will include co‐interventions, provided they are not part of the randomised treatment and are comparable in both the intervention and comparator groups, to establish a fair comparison. If a study includes multiple arms, we will include any arm that meets the inclusion criteria for this review.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^acd57044]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Only a few studies have directly compared the efficacy of CBT and medications for daytime symptoms in insomnia, with mixed findings. In a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of young and middle-aged patients with chronic sleep-onset insomnia, no significant differences were found among CBT, medications, and combination therapy on mood-related changes after intervention.Another RCT of older patients with chronic insomnia found that CBT was more effective than zopiclone in reducing anxiety symptoms in the long term, and equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms in the short term.Furthermore, in an exploratory study of sequential treatments involving both medication and CBT, only CBT provided alone led to significant improvements in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention.These inconsistent results preclude definite conclusions about optimal therapy for improving daytime symptoms among patients with insomnia disorder.Although previous insomnia treatment studies have focused primarily on improving nocturnal symptoms of sleep continuity, greater attention to residual daytime impairments is important to optimize long-term outcomes. In addition, it is common for patients with insomnia who had suboptimal treatment responses to switch from one therapy to another in clinical practice. However, to our knowledge, no study has explored which first-stage treatment is optimal for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia and which second-stage treatment offers the best added value for patients whose insomnia has not remitted with psychological or medication first-stage therapy.

The main objectives of this study were to compare short-term and long-term changes in daytime functions of 4 treatment sequences using psychological (behavioral and cognitive) and pharmacologic therapies (zolpidem and trazodone) for insomnia. In particular, the study aimed to compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy (BT) and zolpidem as first-stage therapies for improvement of daytime functions. For those whose insomnia did not remit after first-stage therapy, the added value of a second treatment was evaluated. Daytime functions investigated in the current study were among the predefined secondary outcomes of a previously published trial.Previous publications regarding the primary outcome related to sleep have suggested the benefits of sequential treatment paradigms on improving nocturnal symptoms of insomnia. We hypothesized that (1) participants receiving BT would show greater improvements in daytime functions after first-stage treatment than those receiving zolpidem and (2) of all patients receiving second-stage treatment, those who switched modalities (from BT to zolpidem, or vice versa) would report greater improvements at the end of second-stage treatment and at follow-ups than those continuing with the same treatment modality.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^401f2261]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Treatments

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

The first-stage psychological therapy consisted of BT, which included sleep restrictionand stimulus control procedures.The second-stage psychological treatment consisted of CT, which targeted some perpetuating mechanisms (eg, ruminations and worries) that are implicated in the association between insomnia and mood disturbances (eg, anxiety and depression).

Medication

The first-stage medication treatment involved sublingual zolpidem, 5 mg to 10 mg, taken nightly at bedtime. The second-stage pharmacotherapy consisted of trazodone, 50 to 150 mg, taken 30 minutes before bedtime. As a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, trazodone can alleviate a wide range of depressive symptoms with an additional sedative effect of sleep,and it has shown efficacy for both patients with insomnia and those with comorbid major depression.Additional information about treatment implementation can be found in a previous publication.

The intention-to-treat analyses were performed in April and October 2023. To evaluate each treatment sequence while taking into account the nature of the SMART design (ie, 2 randomizations, where the second is conditional on the response to the first), the analytic strategy was based on recommendations from Nahum-Shani et al.Daytime functional outcomes according to 4 treatment sequences and 5 times (assessment after first-stage treatment [post1] to follow-up at 12 months) were analyzed using weighted generalized estimating equations models with identity link function.Weights were computed as the product of a missing model weight (to attenuate the effect of missing at random data) and a randomization weight (to correct for the inclusion of data from the patients whose insomnia remitted in stage 1 in the 2 sequences at stage 2 and beyond). Strata variables (site, age, sex, and comorbidity status) and outcome value at baseline were included as covariates.A priori contrasts within the weighted generalized estimating equations models were used to estimate temporal changes (baseline to post1, post1 to post2, and post2 to 12-month follow-up) and their 95% CIs and to test significance for comparisons between and within sequences. Data analyses were performed using the SAS, version 9.4, statistical software (SAS Institute Inc) with standard 2-tailed P <.05 considered statistically significant (P values for comparisons between sequences were adjusted for multiplicity using the simultaneous test procedure).

### Characterisation of the effects of caffeine on sleep in the rat: a potential model of sleep disruption [^1146de54]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Caffeine is known to disrupt sleep and its administration to human subjects has been used to model sleep disruption. We previously showed that its effects on sleep onset latency are comparable between rats and humans. This study evaluated the potential use of caffeine as a model of sleep disruption in the rat, by assessing its effects on sleep architecture and electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectrum, and using sleep-promoting drugs to reverse these effects. Rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices for body temperature, EEG, electromyogram and locomotor activity. Following recovery, animals were dosed with caffeine (10 mg/kg) alone or in combination with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) or trazodone (20 mg/kg). Sleep was scored for the subsequent 12 h using automated analysis software. Caffeine dose-dependently disrupted sleep: it increased WAKE time, decreased NREM (non-REM) sleep time and NREM bout duration (but not bout number), and decreased delta activity in NREM sleep. It also dose-dependently increased locomotor activity and body temperature. When given alone, zolpidem suppressed REM whilst trazodone increased NREM sleep time at the expense of WAKE, increased NREM bout duration, increased delta activity in NREM sleep and reduced body temperature. In combination, zolpidem attenuated caffeine's effects on WAKE, whilst trazodone attenuated its effects on NREM sleep, NREM bout duration, delta activity, body temperature and locomotor activity. Caffeine administration produced many of the signs of insomnia that were improved by two of its most successful current treatments. This model may therefore be useful in the study of new drugs for the treatment of sleep disturbance.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^5389bc15]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2. Dosage and Administration

2.1 Dose Selection

An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage.

The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

2.2 Improtant Administration Instructions

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line.

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Trazodone

Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Switchning to or from Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping trazodone hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.5 Dosage Recommendations for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Consider reducing trazodone dose based on tolerability when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Consider increasing trazodone dose based on therapeutic response when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Trazodone

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of trazodone [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping trazodone abruptly whenever possible.

### New pharmacologic agents for insomnia and hypersomnia [^4e783b18]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Insomnia and hypersomnia are conditions with multifactorial causes that can be difficult to treat. There have been recent developments and changes in the treatment of both conditions, including the addition of some agents that have a novel mechanism of action. This review summarizes recent changes and highlights pertinent updates.

Recent Findings

Benzodiazepine receptor agonists received a warning in 2019 regarding the possibility of complex sleep behaviors, such as sleepwalking. Zolpidem has been marketed in new dosage forms that include sublingual tablets and oral spray formulations. Orexin receptor antagonists appear to be well tolerated with a good safety profile. Suvorexant received an approval for the treatment of patients with comorbid insomnia and dementia. Lemborexant was demonstrated to be effective for maintenance insomnia. Trazodone was shown to affect the oligomerization of tau proteins thus suggesting potential implications in attenuating dementia pathology. Pitolisant, a novel histamine-3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, gained approval for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy as well as obstructive sleep apnea. Solriamfetol, a new norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was approved for hypersomnolence based on good efficacy, but with cardiovascular warnings.

Summary

Recent advancements in the treatment of insomnia includes agents with novel mechanisms, new indications, and new dosage forms. Risk of complex sleep behaviors, and possible next-day driving impairment, should be discussed for all agents used for insomnia, including orexin receptor antagonists. Novel agents also are available for hypersomnia and there are options beyond traditional stimulants that may have great utility.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^fd281ce2]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

History of hypnotic usage—pharmacological agents have been used for insomnia throughout much of recorded history, with the first benzodiazepine (BZD) chlordiazepoxide introduced to the United States market in 1963, followed by diazepam. Flurazepam, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hypnotic BZD, became available in 1970 and rapidly supplanted barbiturates and similar compounds for treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem, the first United States nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist (non-BZD, BzRA), became available in 1992 and remains the most widely prescribed hypnotic medication, accounting for 87.5% of all BzRA prescriptions in a recent survey. Since 2005, ramelteon, low-dose doxepin, and suvorexant have entered the United States market.

### Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia?-AAFP (...) [^242281fd]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia. Evidence-Based Answer Trazodone should not be used to treat insomnia. Trazodone decreases the number of nightly awakenings and may slightly improve subjective sleep quality, but it does not significantly improve total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, or waking time after sleep onset. Trazodone causes more adverse effects than placebo. It also has a higher fall risk than zolpidem or benzodiazepines. Patients treated with trazodone, zolpidem, and benzodiazepines have higher fall rates than untreated patients. 1 Patients with insomnia were included regardless of whether it was primary or secondary insomnia. Primary outcomes included sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep quality.

When trazodone was compared with placebo, there was no significant improvement in sleep efficiency and small to no change in sleep quality. Two low-quality RCTs used polysomnography to assess sleep efficiency and found no difference. One low-quality RCT showed more adverse effects, including morning grogginess, dry mouth, and thirst, at two weeks with trazodone compared with placebo. A 2022 retrospective cohort study assessed fall risk, health care use, and cost among 313, 086 adults in the United States treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines for insomnia. Patients treated with trazodone had a higher risk of falls compared with zolpidem extended-release, zolpidem immediate-relief, and benzodiazepines.

### Quetiapine for insomnia associated with refractory depression exacerbated by phenelzine [^bd623119]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the successful treatment of phenelzine-associated insomnia with low-dose quetiapine in a patient with refractory depression.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old white man with severe major depression unresponsive to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants improved following treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine. Insomnia, present to a moderate degree prior to antidepressant therapy, worsened markedly following phenelzine treatment and failed to respond to diphenhydramine, temazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, zolpidem, or trazodone given at high therapeutic doses. Sleep disturbance resolved with low-dose (50 mg) adjunctive quetiapine, with no adverse effects.

Discussion

Major depression refractory to standard therapy is a common and serious condition. Some cases respond to MAOIs; however, orthostatic hypotension and insomnia frequently occur. Potentially serious MAOI interactions with psychotropic drugs have raised concerns about combining these agents. In this case, a failure of a number of other medications known to treat MAOI-associated insomnia safely prompted a trial of quetiapine. Despite the possibility that enhanced serotonergic activity might have resulted in serotonin syndrome, no adverse interactions between phenelzine and quetiapine were noted. The use of low-dose, once-daily quetiapine, along with its unique binding properties, may account for its increased safety in combination with phenelzine.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that low-dose quetiapine may be an alternative treatment for phenelzine-associated insomnia. Further case reports are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of combining these agents.

### Zolpidem tartrate (zolpidem) [^4c88419e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage in Adults

Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 5 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 10 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . The total dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night.

The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because Zolpidem clearance is lower in women.

Long-term use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is not recommended. Treatment should be as short as possible. Extended treatment should not take place without re-evaluation of the patient's status because the risk of abuse and dependence increase with the duration of treatment [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]

2.2 Special Populations

Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of Zolpidem tartrate. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Use with CNS Depressants

Dosage adjustment may be necessary when Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.7)].

2.4 Administration

The effect of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal.

### Impact of secured prescription implementation for zolpidem on hypnotics use in France: a time-series analysis on national data [^1986f9aa]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the impact of the implementation of a requirement that zolpidem prescriptions be obtained via secured forms (April 2017) on zolpidem and other hypnotics use in France. We conducted a time-series analysis on data from the French national health care system, from January 1, 2015 to January 3, 2018, for all reimbursed hypnotics. An important and immediate decrease in zolpidem use (-161,873 defined daily doses [DDD]/month; -215,425 to -108,323) was evidenced, with a concomitant raise in zopiclone use (+64,871; +26,925 to +102,817). These findings suggest that the change in zolpidem prescribing policies was effective, but has resulted in a shift from zolpidem to zopiclone. Further interventions are needed to decrease hypnotics' overuse in France.

### Psychiatric treatment considerations with direct acting antivirals in hepatitis C [^cd001f75]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Zolpidem is metabolized through a variety of CYP450 isozymes, including CYP3A, 2C9, 1A2, 2D6, and 2C19. In the presence of steady-state telaprevir, zolpidem exposures were unexpectedly reduced by 47%. Close monitoring and dose titration of zolpidem is recommended if this agent is coadministered with telaprevir. Zopiclone is also metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree by CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Zopiclone concentrations may theoretically be increased by DAAs and require close monitoring. Most other benzodiazepines should be used cautiously in patients on DAAs. Clinicians may consider starting with a decreased benzodiazepine dose and monitoring for benzodiazepine-related toxicity, or selecting an alternate agent such as lorazepam, oxazepam or temazepam. Dose reductions are also recommended in patients with severe liver impairment as per product monographs.

### The use of trazodone as a hypnotic: a critical review [^20fb2631]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic. In view of this widespread popularity, it seems prudent to review what is known of the safety and efficacy of trazodone when used in this context.

Data Sources and Selection

A MEDLINE search of the literature published in English between 1975 and 2003 that included the keywords sleep, trazodone, Desyrel, depression, sleeping pill, and sedative-hypnotics was conducted.

Data Synthesis

From this review, it is concluded that there are very few data to suggest that trazodone improves sleep in patients without mood disorder, though it does increase total sleep in patients with major depressive disorder. There are virtually no dose-response data for trazodone vis-à-vis sleep and, similarly, no available data on tolerance to its possible hypnotic effects. Areas of concern with its use include reports of significant dropout rates and induction of arrhythmias, primarily in patients with histories of cardiac disease, as well as the development of priapism.

Conclusion

In summary, there are few data to support the use of trazodone in nondepressed subjects. When the risk-benefit ratio of trazodone is assessed, its side effect profile, which is much more significant than that of conventional hypnotics, should be considered.

### Zolpidem tartrate (zolpidem) [^3f0f2f48]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

Zolpidem Tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.

Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of Zolpidem Tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while Zolpidem Tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo.

Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of Zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving Zolpidem or any other hypnotic.

### Dispensing of zolpidem and low-dose trazodone among commercially insured adults in the US, 2011-2018 (...) [^1d75dc60]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The short black dashes above the vertical bars indicate the 95% CIs around the annual percentages. Understanding contemporary trends is important given that zolpidem is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia and backed by abundant efficacy data, 4 but documented safety concerns exist. 5, 6 In contrast, trazodone is not FDA approved for insomnia and has limited efficacy data and undocumented safety for this indication. 4 We measured the dispensing of these drugs from 2011 to 2018 among commercially insured US adults. We conducted sensitivity analyses with higher specificity for identifying prescriptions dispensed for insomnia that analyzed trends for trazodone at dosages less than or equal to 50 mg/d and considered only adults with a diagnosis code for insomnia in the past year. All models used generalized estimating equations to account for within-individual correlation in the data across years. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.
4. The study was approved by the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent. The adjusted annual change was 0. 07% for trazodone and −0. 25% for zolpidem. Results for trazodone were similar for dosages less than or equal to 50 mg/d. The adjusted annual change was 0. 69% for trazodone and −2. 31% for zolpidem. Results for trazodone were also similar for dosages less than or equal to 50 mg/d. Low-dose trazodone was dispensed with increased frequency during the period before to nearly 2 years after a US guideline in early 20174 suggested not using trazodone for insomnia, although these increases were modest. Dispensing of zolpidem was already decreasing before 2 FDA safety announcements in 20135 and a black box warning in 2019.

6 In 2018, zolpidem was still being dispensed more frequently than low-dose trazodone, but the gap between these drugs has narrowed since 2011, suggesting an increasing preference toward off-label use of trazodone for insomnia.

Statistical analyses

Comparisons on primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups followed repeated-measures analysis of variance while accounting for inter-evaluation intervals, i.e. the length of time between baseline and final visits. Cognitive and functional assessment scores were treated as dependent variables, and trazodone use as a fixed factor. Significance level was set at 0.05, and one-tailed significance testing was performed given the a priori hypothesis that trazodone is associated with delayed cognitive decline. Significance testing on secondary outcomes and post-hoc analyses accounted for multiple comparisons by applying Bonferroni correction.

Table 2 
Trazodone effects on primary outcome (Mini-Mental State Examination)

CI, confidence interval; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; ChEi, cholinesterase inhibitor. a Inter-evaluation intervals differ according to subsets of participants included. b In addition to CN participants, MCI participants without AD predicted primary pathology were excluded.

Additional analyses tested trazodone effects on MMSE only in participants who had AD-predicted pathology based on clinical judgment, and while accounting for concomitant sedative and stimulant medication effects. A sedative medication binary variable represented use of the following: benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, narcotics, atypical antipsychotics, antihistamines, or anticholinergic medications. A stimulant medication binary variable represented use of the following: cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi), dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotoninergic antidepressant medications. A final group comparison of trazodone effects on MMSE accounted specifically for the concomitant use of ChEi, because they represent the main medication class with an established cognitive benefit in AD. Six participants in each group used ChEi. Furthermore, to test whether trazodone use was correlated with ChEi use, a possible confounder for observed trazodone effects, we calculated the mean square contingency coefficient (φ). Finally, to assess whether the observed trazodone effects were mediated through improvement of sleep, we performed post-hoc exploratory repeated measures analysis of variance while accounting, first, for presence or absence of sleep problems (insomnia or hypersomnia) at the baseline visit and, second, for longitudinal changes in sleep complaints between baseline and follow-up evaluations accounting for multiple comparisons. Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.

Pain

The first therapeutic step is an optimization of antiparkinsonian medications.
Nociceptive pain should be treated according to the 3-step WHO regimen.
Neuropathic pain should be treated with anticonvulsants and/or antidepressants as indicated in the guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, with preference given to gabapentin 300–1800 mg (rarely up to 3600 mg), especially in case of concomitant restless legs syndrome, and/or duloxetine 60–120 mg, in case of concomitant depression. Gabapentin is preferred over pregabalin due to its proven tolerability in PD and potentially positive influence on motor symptoms.
For severe pain, treatment with prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone 5/2.5–20/10 mg (rarely up to 40/20 mg) may be considered.
In the experience of the authors of the present publication, local botulinum toxin application might be considered in single individuals with pain refractory to maximized oral or transdermal treatment, especially in case of on- and off dystonia, muscular pain trigger points, painful myotonus, spasms in the esophagus, pylorus, anal sphincter or hyperactive bladder. In such cases, the botulinum toxin application should be endoscopically guided.

Sleep

Primary sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome or sleep disordered breathing should be treated according to the corresponding guidelines.
If motor or non-motor fluctuations determine sleep disturbances, the dopaminergic pharmacotherapy should be adjusted accordingly.
RBD should be firstly treated by creating a safe sleep environment. Clonazepam (0.125–3 mg) and/or melatonin (2–9 mg) can be considered, bearing in mind possible side effects.
In case of insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, underlying causes such as medication side effects and/or primary sleep disorders should be ruled out. If treatable causes have been ruled out, circadian rhythm disorders should be treated with sleep hygiene measures, intensive physical training and light therapy. Starting with the lowest possible dosage, eszopiclone (1 mg), doxepin (25 mg), zolpidem (5 mg), trazodone (50 mg), melatonin (2 mg), venlafaxine (37.5 mg, in case of comorbid depression), nortriptyline (25 mg) or mirtazapine (7.5 mg) can be used for treating insomnia (low level of evidence). Further dose adjustments may be required on an individual basis. Side effects should be carefully monitored at follow-up.

### Adverse effects of Z-drugs for sleep disturbance in people living with dementia: a population-based cohort study [^dae3ce5f]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Two additional cohorts were created by matching the Z-drug and BZD cohorts on age, sex, and antipsychotic use, to non-users (not prescribed sedative-hypnotics) with proximal GP consultation. We matched three non-users to each Z-drug or benzodiazepine user, without replacement, and assigned an index date as the closest GP consultation within 1 month of the corresponding Z-drug or benzodiazepine index date. Patients could be members of different cohorts over time.

Exclusion criteria for all cohorts were (1) < 12 months data history; (2) sedative-hypnotic prescription in the last 12 months; (3) prior diagnosis of sleep apnoea, sleep-related respiratory failure, or alcohol abuse (codes in Additional file 1); (4) prescription of multiple sedative-hypnotics; and (5) newly prescribed antipsychotics or low-dose tricyclic or related antidepressants (≤ 25 mg amitriptyline or ≤ 50 mg trazodone per day). We additionally performed a separate validation study on the accuracy of our patient selection (details in Additional file 2). In summary, GP practices confirmed dementia diagnoses in 96% of cases; however, uncertainty was raised regarding the accuracy of those identified with sleep disturbance.

To test dose-response relationships, we determined the number of daily defined doses (DDDs) of Z-drugs and benzodiazepines at each prescription. The DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug based on its main indication in adults. We used DDD values from the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, where the DDDs for zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon are 7.5 mg, 10 mg, and 10 mg per day, respectively. The British National Formulary recommends these daily doses for adults with insomnia, but to halve them for elderly patients. Missing dosing frequency data was assumed once daily, except diazepam where we applied the most common frequency for the product and quantity prescribed among the complete prescription data.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^dd6e5d59]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Trazodone longitudinal effects on primary and secondary outcomes are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Trazodone non-users declined 2.6-fold faster on the MMSE than trazodone users, at an estimated inter-evaluation interval for both groups averaging 4.12 years (Fig. 2). Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant even when only participants with AD-predicted pathology were included, with non-users declining 2.4-fold faster than trazodone users across an average of 3.75 years. These effects varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications, retaining significance when accounting for overall concomitant sedative and stimulant use, with non-users declining 1.94-fold faster than trazodone users. Trazodone effects were not significant when accounting only for ChEi use. This latter finding did not reflect confounding effects from correlated administration of trazodone and ChEi (φ = –0.131; p = 0.355). We further performed additional post-hoc analysis to address a possible non-linear decline in MMSE associated with the longer inter-evaluation interval available for trazodone non-users. Still, trazodone non-users declined 2.0-fold faster on the MMSE than trazodone users, at an estimated inter-evaluation interval averaging 3.59 years, with each group retaining the same annual rate of decline (0.3 versus 0.7 points per year on MMSE for trazodone users versus non-users). These effects of trazodone on MMSE were marginally non-significant (p = 0.054, compare to Table 1). When evaluating, however, for sleep mediating effects of trazodone to longitudinal MMSE performance, significant effects were observed for both presence of sleep problems at the baseline visit (p = 0.006) and changes in sleep from baseline (p = 0.006) (Fig. 3), the latter being driven by improvement in sleep on the follow up visit (p = 0.0006) but not for stable (p = 0.326) or worsening of sleep (p = 0.176) in the follow up visit.

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^e3f2e519]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression, but it is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans. In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict the brain concentrations of trazodone for different drug-dosing regimens and calculating occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available. Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect, and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone (e.g. dry-mouth, hypotension and priapism).

Factors Associated With Failure of Guideline-Recommended Hypnotic Monotherapy in Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis

Large hazard ratios (HRs) indicate more monotherapy failures, whereas small HRs indicate fewer monotherapy failures. BEDCA indicates behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence; UMD, unspecified mental disorder.

a Adjusted for age group (20-39, 40-64, or ≥65 years), sex, administration instructions of the first prescribed hypnotic (regular prescription, prescription as needed, or both), concomitant anxiolytics, concomitant antidepressants, concomitant antipsychotics, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and comorbid physical disorders in the month of the first prescription.

Among patients who did not experience failure of guideline-recommended hypnotic monotherapy, 84.6% discontinued hypnotics within 6 months (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). Monotherapy discontinuation was highest with zolpidem (85.2%), followed by ramelteon (84.9%), suvorexant (84.0%), triazolam (83.7%), and eszopiclone (82.9%). Monotherapy discontinuation was noted more in the ramelteon (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.24-1.40]; P <.001) and suvorexant (AOR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.15-1.26]; P <.001) groups than in the eszopiclone group, but there was no significant difference between the zolpidem (AOR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.97-1.04]; P =.97) or triazolam (AOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.97-1.07]; P =.50) group and the eszopiclone group (Figure 2 and eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

### Zolpidem tartrate [^213663c6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 CNS-Active Drugs

CNS Depressants

Coadministration of zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression. Concomitant use of zolpidem with these drugs may increase drowsiness and psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving ability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs.

Alcohol

An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral zolpidem was demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] .

Opioids 

The concomitant use of zolpidem tartrate tablets with opioids may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of zolpidem tartrate tablets and opioids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Imipramine, Chlorpromazine

Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Sertraline

Concomitant administration of zolpidem and sertraline increases exposure to zolpidem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Fluoxetine

After multiple doses of zolpidem tartrate and fluoxetine an increase in the zolpidem half-life (17%) was observed. There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Haloperidol

A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^ddc2c6c7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Zolpidem—sleep latency (SL) outcomes show meta-analytic and trial-based reductions. For polysomnography (PSG) SL, five studies were included with a mean difference from placebo of −11.65 min and a 95% CI of −4.15 to −19.15 min; heterogeneity was high and the quality of evidence was rated as very low. For subjective SL, ten studies were meta-analyzed with an improvement at the significance threshold (mean difference: 19.55 min; CI: −14.2 to −24.9 min) and evidence quality was very low due to imprecision, heterogeneity and potential publication bias. Additional trials addressing middle-of-the-night (MOTN) awakenings reported reductions with sublingual zolpidem (PSG: 1.75 mg: −11.2 min versus placebo; 3.5 mg: −14.8 min; subjective: 1.75 mg: −11.3 min versus placebo; 3.5 mg: −15.23 min), immediate-release zolpidem reduced PSG latency by ∼30.5 min versus placebo after induced MOTN awakenings, and sublingual or buccal preparations produced −10.28 min shorter latency than oral preparation.

7. DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 CNS active drugs
7.2 Drugs that affect drug metabolism via cytochrome P450
7.3 Other drugs with no interaction with zolpidem

7. Drug Interactions:

7.1 CNS active drugs

Since the systematic evaluations of zolpidem in combination with other CNS-active drugs have been limited, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of any CNS-active drug to be used with zolpidem. Any drug with CNS-depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS-depressant effect of zolpidem.

Zolpidem tartrate tablets were evaluated in healthy subjects in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs. Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance. A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^89c99b0d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This study is part of an RCT that aimed to examine the comparative efficacy of 4 treatment sequences involving psychological and medication therapies for insomnia with and without comorbid psychiatric disorder (trial protocol in Supplement 1). Details of the study design, methods, and primary results can be found elsewhere. The study was conducted at 2 sites: Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Québec, Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, and National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado. Participants were enrolled between May 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the local ethics committees of both sites and all participants provided written informed consent. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

This project adopted a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design with 2 treatment stages and 2 treatment modalities for each stage (Figure).Eligible participants were randomly assigned to BT or zolpidem at a 1:1 ratio. The first randomization was conducted at each site and stratified by sex, age (<55 vs ≥55 years), and presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder. After the initial 6 weeks of therapy, patients who met insomnia remission criteria were followed up for the next 12 months while receiving maintenance therapy. Participants were regarded as meeting insomnia remission criteria if their Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score was less than 8 at the end of first treatment stage.Patients whose insomnia did not remit were randomized (stratified by first randomization and comorbidity) to a second-stage psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy [CT]) or medication therapy (zolpidem or trazodone). Measurements were conducted at baseline, end of first-stage therapy (post1) and second-stage therapy (post2), and at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. A complete description of the study protocol is available in Supplement 1.
