## Question

Can you take NSAIDs with methotrexate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether NSAIDs can be taken with methotrexate and under what conditions this is safe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about methotrexate dose categories (high-dose oncology versus low-dose rheumatology/dermatology). Then, I should verify the mechanism of interaction and the clinical evidence for concomitant use at low doses. Next, I will review patient-specific risk modifiers (renal function, hepatotoxicity risk, concomitant nephrotoxins) and formal monitoring recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance for common clinical scenarios and articulate a bottom-line recommendation with safety caveats [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE].

> Let me first confirm the most critical distinction: high-dose methotrexate used in oncology versus low-dose weekly methotrexate used in inflammatory diseases. NSAIDs should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with high-dose methotrexate because they reduce renal clearance of methotrexate and have been associated with prolonged exposure, severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity, and deaths; this is an absolute contraindication in that setting [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE] [^115cqudz]. Wait, I initially almost generalized that NSAIDs are contraindicated with methotrexate at any dose — but hold on, that's not correct; at low weekly doses for rheumatologic and dermatologic indications, cautious coadministration is common in practice with appropriate monitoring, whereas the oncology high-dose context is the one in which coadministration is unsafe and should be avoided [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE].

> I need to check the mechanism to make sure the pharmacology aligns with the clinical advice. NSAIDs, including salicylates, compete for renal tubular secretion of methotrexate and may also displace it from protein binding, reducing clearance and transiently increasing free drug; the risk is magnified with higher methotrexate exposures or impaired kidney function, which explains the danger in high-dose regimens [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE] [^11116QnE]. Hold on, I should verify whether PPIs matter here too; labels note caution with PPIs, especially with high-dose methotrexate, because they can further impair renal elimination, reinforcing the need to avoid interacting agents in the oncology context [^114WFzBE] [^111oYnSX].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for low-dose methotrexate with NSAIDs in inflammatory arthritis. Trials in rheumatoid arthritis commonly included constant background NSAID dosing without clear safety signals, and expert recommendations from the 3e Initiative conclude that methotrexate can be used safely with standard NSAID doses, excluding anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin; a Cochrane review similarly found no increase in adverse events or methotrexate withdrawals with NSAID co-use in RA cohorts, acknowledging the modest quality of evidence [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE] [^111nAcGX] [^112V1P6n]. Let me double-check the dose context: most RA studies used 7.5–15 mg/week, so extrapolation to higher "low-dose" ranges (e.g., 20–25 mg/week) warrants additional caution and monitoring, particularly in psoriasis where doses can be higher and toxicity risk may rise [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE].

> Now, I will examine NSAID-specific nuances, especially aspirin. Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (for example, ≤ 100 mg/day) likely has minimal pharmacokinetic interaction, but anti-inflammatory aspirin at ≥ 650 mg/day has different kinetics and is more likely to increase risk when combined with methotrexate; therefore, avoid high-dose aspirin while allowing cardioprotective doses if clinically indicated and monitored [^111nAcGX]. Let me reconsider whether any particular NSAID is clearly safer; based on the evidence provided, no specific NSAID stands out as uniquely safer, so the principle remains to use the lowest effective dose and maintain consistency rather than intermittent surges that could unpredictably alter clearance [^111nAcGX] [^112V1P6n].

> I should confirm patient-specific risk factors that materially alter safety. Renal impairment is pivotal: for eGFR 20–50 mL/min/1.73 m² or 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m², a 50% methotrexate dose reduction with close monitoring is advised, and severe renal dysfunction is generally a contraindication; oncology dosing guidance also emphasizes variable kidney function thresholds and the high AKI risk with high-dose methotrexate, underscoring the danger of adding NSAIDs in that context [^115gLLgf] [^115Msfbh] [^114U9EKV]. Hold on, I should verify co-medication risks: penicillins, sulfonamides, PPIs, probenecid, and other nephrotoxic or highly protein-bound drugs can raise methotrexate exposure; if unavoidable, intensify monitoring and consider dose adjustments, and avoid dehydration, which can precipitate toxicity with NSAIDs on board [^11116QnE] [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE].

> Let me think about the monitoring framework when NSAIDs are used with low-dose methotrexate. Baseline labs should include CBC, liver enzymes, albumin, and creatinine, followed by frequent checks during the first two months (about every 2–4 weeks) and then spacing to every three months once stable; this cadence aligns with dermatology guideline schedules for systemic methotrexate and the general safety profile in labeling, and risk-stratified approaches in primary care further support tailored monitoring once stability is achieved [^113axBkP] [^116Mseax] [^1131w6BR]. I should double-check that any change in NSAID dosing or the addition of an interacting drug should prompt an interim lab assessment to catch early shifts in clearance or organ toxicity, especially in those with marginal renal reserve [^113axBkP] [^116Mseax].

> I will now examine the symptom triggers that warrant immediate evaluation or holding therapy. Warning symptoms include mucositis, severe nausea or diarrhea, easy bruising or bleeding, fever or signs of infection, cough or dyspnea suggesting pneumonitis, reduced urine output, or edema; these should prompt urgent labs and reassessment, with a low threshold to hold methotrexate and NSAIDs until toxicity is excluded [^116Mseax] [^112Jri5n] [^111VXpq9] [^116b8YK1]. Wait, let me verify pulmonary risk: methotrexate pneumonitis can occur even at low doses and is not always reversible, reinforcing the importance of prompt evaluation of new respiratory symptoms regardless of NSAID use [^115cqudz].

> Next, I should review practical scenarios to ensure the advice is actionable. For an established RA patient on 15 mg/week methotrexate, stable background NSAIDs may be continued at the lowest effective dose with routine monitoring; this mirrors the trial settings where NSAIDs were maintained without apparent problems, though individual risk factors must still be considered [^114WFzBE] [^112V1P6n]. If initiating methotrexate in a patient already taking chronic NSAIDs, there is no need to stop NSAIDs preemptively at low methotrexate doses; instead, start low, escalate cautiously, and increase monitoring frequency during titration and after any NSAID changes, while counseling on hydration and interaction risks [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is high-dose methotrexate for psoriasis flares or oncologic indications? Here I need to be explicit: NSAIDs should be stopped at least 24–48 hours before and avoided during high-dose methotrexate administration, with resumption only after methotrexate levels are undetectable and renal function is confirmed stable; multidisciplinary supportive care pathways emphasize avoiding interacting drugs and ensuring urine alkalinization to minimize AKI and delayed clearance [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE] [^111NKwq8]. Hold on, I should verify that even moderate "low-dose" ranges used in dermatology can approach risk in susceptible patients, so individualized caution remains appropriate outside oncology as doses rise or renal function wanes [^111oYnSX].

> Finally, I should synthesize the bottom line so the guidance is clear. For patients on low-dose weekly methotrexate (generally ≤ 25 mg/week) for inflammatory diseases, NSAIDs can generally be used concurrently if you use the lowest effective NSAID dose, avoid anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin, maintain good hydration, account for renal function with methotrexate dose adjustments when indicated, and adhere to systematic laboratory monitoring with interim checks after NSAID or interacting drug changes; educate patients on early toxicity symptoms and hold therapy during acute illness, dehydration, or kidney injury [^111nAcGX] [^113axBkP] [^115gLLgf] [^11116QnE]. In contrast, for high-dose methotrexate regimens, NSAIDs are contraindicated peri-dose and should be withheld to prevent life-threatening toxicity from delayed methotrexate clearance; manage with standardized supportive care and avoidance of interacting agents until methotrexate is fully cleared [^111oYnSX] [^114WFzBE] [^111NKwq8].

---

NSAIDs can be used with methotrexate at **standard rheumatology doses (7.5–25 mg/week)** when renal function is normal and appropriate monitoring is in place [^111nAcGX]. Avoid NSAIDs with **high-dose methotrexate (≥ 500 mg/m²)** [^111oYnSX] due to reduced methotrexate clearance and consequent risk of severe toxicity [^114U9EKV]. Use the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, with regular CBC, renal, and liver function monitoring [^1131w6BR]; avoid or exercise extreme caution in the presence of renal impairment.

---

## Pharmacological interaction between NSAIDs and methotrexate

Methotrexate is cleared primarily by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [^11116QnE]. NSAIDs can inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis, reduce renal blood flow, and competitively inhibit renal tubular secretion [^111oYnSX], resulting in higher methotrexate levels and **increased toxicity risk** [^112V1P6n].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction and toxicity

In patients receiving **high-dose methotrexate**, concomitant NSAIDs can markedly increase methotrexate levels [^115cqudz] and cause severe or fatal hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity [^111oYnSX]. With **low-dose methotrexate**, fixed-dose NSAIDs are commonly used in RA without major issues [^112V1P6n], though caution is advised — especially with renal impairment or at higher methotrexate doses [^111nAcGX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Methotrexate dose** | **NSAID use** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| High-dose (≥ 500 mg/m²) | Avoid | Contraindicated due to severe toxicity risk [^111oYnSX] [^114U9EKV] |
| Low-dose (7.5–25 mg/week) | Use with caution | - Permitted with monitoring <br/> - Avoid if renal impairment [^111nAcGX] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

- **Renal function**: Impairment increases methotrexate accumulation and toxicity; avoid or use extreme caution with NSAIDs.

- **Age**: Older adults have higher risk of renal impairment and adverse effects; monitor closely [^115dvFf5].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and hepatic disease increase NSAID risks; consider alternatives [^115dvFf5].

---

## Recommended monitoring strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: CBC, renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR), and liver enzymes before starting therapy [^113axBkP].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: CBC, renal, and liver function every 4–8 weeks initially [^115vivrv], then every 12–16 weeks if stable [^1131w6BR].

- **Clinical vigilance**: Watch for signs of toxicity (myelosuppression, mucositis, renal dysfunction, GI symptoms) [^116Mseax].

---

## Alternative pain management strategies

Acetaminophen is the **preferred first-line analgesic** due to lower renal and GI risk [^111nAcGX]. COX-2 inhibitors may be considered for patients at high GI risk, but use caution and monitor for renal and cardiovascular effects [^115dvFf5]. Non-pharmacological therapies such as physical therapy, exercise, and weight management should also be used.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High-dose methotrexate**: NSAIDs contraindicated due to severe toxicity risk [^114WFzBE].

- **Low-dose methotrexate**: NSAIDs may be used with caution and regular monitoring; avoid if renal impairment [^112V1P6n].

- **Monitoring**: Regular CBC, renal, and liver function tests are essential [^1131w6BR].

- **Alternatives**: Consider acetaminophen, COX-2 inhibitors, and non-pharmacological options [^111nAcGX].

---

NSAIDs can be used with **low-dose methotrexate** if renal function is normal and appropriate monitoring is in place [^112V1P6n]; they should be avoided with **high-dose methotrexate** due to severe toxicity risk [^111oYnSX].

It should be appreciated, however, that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis, and larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity. Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low-dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with the concomitant use of NSAIDs, including salicylates, has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

### Standardized supportive care documentation improves safety of high-dose methotrexate treatment [^111NKwq8]. The Oncologist (2021). Low credibility.

A review of potential reasons for complications in the SOP group by analysis of all treatment cycles with acute kidney injury and/or delayed MTX clearance revealed potential pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions in 17 treatment cycles and inadequate control of urine alkalinization in 5 treatment cycles.

In the 21 treatment cycles of the SOP group that resulted in acute kidney injury, a potential drug–drug interaction was present in eight cases and inadequate urine alkalinization was present in five cycles. Other causes for nephrotoxicity were one case of tumor lysis syndrome and two patients with pretherapeutic renal impairment.

In the intervention cohort, administration of potentially interacting drugs could be successfully avoided. Specifically, in the three cases of acute kidney injury in the intervention group, no interfering medication was given.

### An update on methotrexate [^116Xrk4u]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for about three decades now. MTX is one of the most effective and commonly used medicines to treat various forms of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions. It has been shown to improve signs and symptoms of RA, disease activity, and function to a similar degree as the tumor necrosis factor blockers, although it inhibits radiographic progression to a smaller degree than the antitumor necrosis factor agents. MTX is considered the anchor drug among the disease-modifying antirheumatic agents and is internationally accepted as the first choice in the management of RA. This review was performed on the basis of a PubMed literature search, looking at all publications on MTX and arthritis in 2008.

Recent findings indicate that MTX seems to prolong the lifespan of patients who tolerate the drug and benefit clinically from this therapy. This may partly be explained by beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality, possibly due to inflammation suppression, although direct atheroprotective effects of MTX may also play a role. MTX is used as monotherapy and in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic agents or biologic agents such as the antitumor necrosis factor agents. The 'early' use of MTX within five years after disease onset is clearly associated with improved outcomes. The management of RA should include early, strong suppression of inflammation and continuously a tight control strategy. The pharmacodynamics and kinetics of MTX are still incompletely understood.

### Methotrexate — how does it really work [^112MgmFM]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methotrexate remains a cornerstone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Folate antagonism is known to contribute to the antiproliferative effects that are important in the action of methotrexate against malignant diseases, but concomitant administration of folic or folinic acid does not diminish the anti-inflammatory potential of this agent, suggesting that other mechanisms of action might be operative.

Although no single mechanism is sufficient to account for all the anti-inflammatory activities of methotrexate, the release of adenosine from cells has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Methotrexate might also confer anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of polyamines. The biological effects on inflammation associated with adenosine release have provided insight into how methotrexate exerts its effects against inflammatory diseases and simultaneously causes some of its well-known adverse effects.

These activities contribute to the complex and multifaceted mechanisms that make methotrexate efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

### Combination therapy for pain management in inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, other spondyloarthritis) [^117TVMSB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Despite optimal therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, many people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) continue to experience persistent pain that may require additional therapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and safety of combination pain therapy for people with IA, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and other spondyloarthritis (SpA). We planned to assess differences in effects between patients on background disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy and patients on no background therapy in subgroup analyses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism (2008–2010).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) assessing combination therapy (at least two drugs from the following classes: analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs, and neuromodulators such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants) compared with monotherapy for adults with IA (RA, AS, PsA, and other SpA). We specifically excluded studies that did not report pain or studies without a standardized pain scale as an outcome measure.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.

### Methotrexate monotherapy and methotrexate combination therapy with traditional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis: Abridged Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114AcdvA]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

We report the posterior median and 95% credible interval for all pairwise treatment effects. To facilitate interpretation of the results, we considered an effect to be "significant" if its 95% credible interval excluded the null effect, which equates to a 97.5% probability that one of the treatments is superior to the other. We recognized, however, that this cut-off was arbitrary and therefore also calculated the probability that each treatment was superior to each other and the rank ordering of treatments.

We converted the average treatment effect for each outcome into an absolute response by using an assumed (baseline) value for oral methotrexate. For all analyses, the assumed baseline value was the median from a Bayesian random effects model of the oral methotrexate arms. For ACR50 response, we used all trials in the analysis to estimate the assumed probability of response. For radiographic progression, we calculated the assumed mean over one year on the Sharp-van der Heijde scale from the trials that reported this outcome for oral methotrexate. We then calculated the absolute effect for each treatment by using this assumed value and the mean differences for each treatment relative to oral methotrexate on the Sharp-van der Heijde scale, which we calculated by multiplying the standardized mean differences by the pooled within-arm standard deviation for studies that used the Sharp-van der Heijde scale. For withdrawals due to adverse events, we estimated the assumed rate at one year from the available trials and converted it to an absolute probability.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: Integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e Initiative [^111nAcGX]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

In the management of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA), methotrexate (MTX) can be used safely in combination with standard doses of paracetamol and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excluding anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies regarding the safety of using NSAIDs and/or paracetamol with MTX in IA identified 17 studies, all in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Most of the included studies were of low to moderate quality. No studies were identified for the combination of MTX and paracetamol, but the experts considered this combination to be generally safe. There was no effect of concurrent NSAID use on the incidence of MTX-related adverse events (AEs) or the rate of MTX withdrawal.

Use of MTX in addition to anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin has been reported to have an adverse effect on liver and renal function. The evidence regarding low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherothrombotic disease is less clear, although pharmacokinetic data suggest that aspirin at daily doses of ≥ 650 mg has different pharmacokinetic properties and is more likely to increase risk in combination with MTX.

In patients with gastrointestinal comorbidities, paracetamol should be considered first. Non-selective NSAIDs in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or COX-2 selective inhibitors with or without a PPI, may be used with caution. In the presence of liver disease, standard precautions for use of NSAIDs and other analgesics should be applied.

Regarding the medical management of polymyalgia rheumatica, specifically concerning methotrexate, the ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of methotrexate in patients:

- **With clinical relapse**: Methotrexate should be considered as an option.
- **Without significant response to corticosteroids**: It may be beneficial for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroids.
- **With corticosteroid-related adverse effects**: Consider methotrexate for those experiencing adverse effects from corticosteroids.

### Euroguiderm guideline on the systemic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris - part 1: treatment and monitoring recommendations [^113axBkP]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of psoriasis, specifically with respect to non-biologic agents like methotrexate, the EDF 2020 guidelines recommend the following assessments during methotrexate therapy:

- **Clinical assessment**: Clinical examination, review of concomitant medications, objective assessment tools for disease severity such as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Body Surface Area, or Physician Global Assessment, assessment for arthritis, and health-related QoL using tools like the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Skindex-29, or Skindex-17.

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC within 2 weeks, every 4 weeks during the first 2 months, and every 3 months thereafter. Liver enzymes and serum albumin every 4 weeks during the first 2 months and every 3 months thereafter. Serum creatinine every 4 weeks during the first 2 months and every 3 months thereafter. PIIINP, where available, every 3 months.

- **Contraception**: Ensure reliable contraception for women of childbearing age and for men.

### Deaths following methotrexate overdoses by medical staff [^115YkzvS]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) with a relatively safe profile, widely used to treat neoplastic diseases as well as dermatologic and rheumatologic disorders. As the indications for the use of MTX increase, more accidental overdoses are noted to occur. Typical problems include deficiencies in labeling, instructions, or packaging, alongside erroneous use. We describe five fatal cases of repeated oral overdose of MTX prescribed by physicians in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to focus attention on the design of the underlying system and the organizational practices as sources of problems.

For drugs used in the management of gout flares or flare prophylaxis when starting ULT (namely NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids, and IL-1 inhibitors), the efficacy outcomes of interest are the resolution or prevention of gout flares, respectively. For this G-CAN consensus statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The specific issues identified with medications used for the management of gout flares and prophylaxis in people with CKD are discussed below, and the G-CAN-proposed research priorities are outlined in Box 3.

- **G-CAN-proposed research priorities for gout drugs in CKD**:

	- **Colchicine**

		- **Treatment of gout flares**: Safe and effective dosing of colchicine in chronic kidney disease (CKD): how should the AGREE trial a colchicine dose be modified in different stages of CKD? How should colchicine be used in people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis? Is the risk of drug interactions with colchicine greater in patients with CKD? Whether the dose of colchicine should be altered when used in combination with atorvastatin in people with CKD.

		- **Gout flare prophylaxis**: Can low-dose colchicine be used in people with ESRD on dialysis? Is there an increased risk of adverse effects with low-dose, longer-term colchicine use in people with CKD?

	- **NSAIDs**

		- **Treatment of gout flares**: Are short-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD? Are longer-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?

		- **Gout flare prophylaxis**: Are some NSAIDs safer than others for longer-term prophylactic use?

	- **Glucocorticoids**

		- **Treatment of gout flares**: What are the guidelines for safe use in patients with CKD?

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^115vivrv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

A summary of the recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) for each of the PICO research questions is presented in Table 2.

- **Research question 1: Efficacy and safety of methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis**:
	- **Recommendation 1**: MTX is recommended as the first-line treatment in oligoarthritis that persists despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and intraarticular steroid (IAS) therapy, and in polyarticular disease (evidence grade 1A). MTX is also recommended in systemic arthritis with predominant joint inflammation, without active systemic features (evidence grade 4C).

	- **Recommendation 2**: Clinical and laboratory monitoring of MTX toxicity is recommended every 4–8 weeks initially, and then every 12–16 weeks, unless risk factors are present (evidence grade 4C).

The PICO framework: P - children affected by JIA; I - administration of MTX; C - placebo or other therapies (salazopyrin, oral steroids, NSAIDs); O - efficacy and safety.

MTX is the most widely used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of JIA. A folic acid analog and an inhibitor of several different enzymes in the folate pathway, MTX exerts immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions. Its efficacy was first demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial more than two decades ago. MTX has been studied in further controlled clinical trials and has been established as the most common first-line DMARD treatment according to several national treatment guidelines. In particular, considering the categories of JIA, NSAIDs and IAS therapy remain the first-line therapies where applicable.

### Integrating international consensus guidelines for anticancer drug dosing in kidney dysfunction (ADDIKD) into everyday practice [^114U9EKV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is an anticancer drug administered via several routes (orally and parenterally) and used in the management of multiple malignancies, including those requiring high plasma concentrations to achieve adequate tumour cell kill. Methotrexate has a wide dosing range and is associated with high variability in interpatient pharmacokinetics. The adverse event profile depends on the dosing (and consequential drug exposure), and high doses (≥ 500 mg/m²) can cause serious adverse events, including acute kidney injury (AKI).

Existing guidelines propose methotrexate dose adjustments in reduced kidney function; however, there are notable inconsistencies, such as the kidney function threshold for discontinuation (varies between creatinine clearance [CrCl] or glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 10–30 mL/min). Furthermore, there is little information on how tumour type, intent of treatment, or dosing levels should influence dose recommendations.

### An evaluation of the utility of routine laboratory monitoring of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): A retrospective review [^113tPupg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

There are no consensus evidence-based guidelines for the routine laboratory monitoring of children with JIA receiving NSAIDs. Recommendations vary, but typically include monitoring serum liver and renal function along with a complete blood count (CBC) every 3 to 6 months. The Committee on Clinical Guidelines for monitoring drug therapy in adults with rheumatoid arthritis recommends yearly CBC and liver function tests depending on the type of NSAID. The incidence of reported NSAID adverse events in adult patients ranges from rare (10%) and states that insufficient data is available to develop complete evidence-based recommendations on the extent and frequency of monitoring. Furthermore, the guidelines also say it is unlikely that studies which gather such data will be performed as toxicities in adults range from 0.1% to 5%. From this, it is expected that evidence is lacking to support the application of these guidelines to the care of children.

Our study has several limitations. As a result of the retrospective design, complete data was not available for all patients, and patients were not followed for a consistent period of time. The frequency of laboratory testing, in general, was relatively low and inconsistent among practitioners and patients. There was no prior determination of either a consistent frequency of laboratory testing or the evaluation and management of children with abnormalities on testing. Specifically, there were no consistent criteria for discontinuing NSAID therapy.

### Methotrexate monotherapy and methotrexate combination therapy with traditional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis: Abridged Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112MUXtc]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Our study highlights the completeness and applicability of evidence related to DMARD therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. We did not evaluate the effect of glucocorticoids, which are known to have a disease-modifying effect, particularly in early rheumatoid arthritis. While we did not exclude trials with corticosteroids, our findings specifically relate to the effects of DMARD therapy independent of corticosteroid influence.

Importantly, our results should not be generalized to patients who have had an inadequate response to biologic therapy, as these trials were not included. Furthermore, our study was not designed to directly compare treatment strategies. Specifically, we did not directly compare the approach of starting with methotrexate monotherapy in methotrexate-naive patients and progressing to triple therapy versus starting with triple therapy directly. However, the estimates of absolute risk with each treatment can help inform this decision. Based on the included trials, about 40% of methotrexate-naive patients are expected to achieve an ACR50 response to oral methotrexate, compared to 60% with triple therapy. Patients may choose methotrexate monotherapy initially, reserving combination therapy for inadequate responses. Notably, triple therapy was associated with an increase in total gastrointestinal events in methotrexate-naive patients, which may influence treatment decisions.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of the review**: This review included 158 trials involving more than 37,000 patients. We employed a rigorous approach to the identification of trials and abstraction of outcomes, which reinforces our confidence in the results.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: a mixed-methods systematic review [^111pJM6P]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Concerns about taking methotrexate (MTX) were expressed by many individuals. Some voiced that MTX might not be effective for inflammatory arthritis (IA) and wanted information on possible risks, long-term harms, lifestyle restrictions, such as alcohol intake, and alternative treatment options. Receiving both verbal and written information at diagnosis, which emphasized care with MTX timing and dosage, safety monitoring blood tests, and potential side effects, added to the concerns for some. Others took a pragmatic approach, maintaining optimism that side effects would not impact them. Satisfaction levels varied; many sought reassurance and more detailed information about the likelihood of side effects to make informed decisions about starting MTX.

Those with greater concerns often used multiple information sources for reassurance about the necessity of taking MTX. However, this sometimes led to conflicting information, raising concerns and creating barriers to starting the treatment. Some individuals chose to avoid 'official' information to minimize concerns about side effects while others rationalized their concerns, accepting that all medications have potential side effects. Information on alternative treatment options was crucial for those worried that side effects might outweigh the potential benefits.

### Canasa [^113hNYjR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Nephrotoxic agents, including NSAIDs, increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine increases the risk of blood disorders; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.

- **Nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**: The use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including NSAIDs, may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine**: The use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of Canasa and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.

- **Interference with urinary normetanephrine measurements**: The use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, due to the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin and paracetamol (acetaminophen) in people receiving methotrexate for inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, other spondyloarthritis) [^112V1P6n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is routinely used in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. There have been concerns regarding the safety of using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin or paracetamol (acetaminophen), or both, in these individuals.

- **Objectives**: To systematically appraise and summarize the scientific evidence on the safety of using NSAIDs, including aspirin, or paracetamol, or both, with methotrexate in inflammatory arthritis; and to identify gaps in the evidence, assess the implications of those gaps, and make recommendations for future research to address these deficiencies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, second quarter 2010), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We also handsearched the conference proceedings for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2008 to 2009) and checked the websites of regulatory agencies for reported adverse events, labels, and warnings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies comparing the safety of methotrexate alone to methotrexate with NSAIDs, including aspirin or paracetamol, or both, in people with inflammatory arthritis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.

Seven studies were included in the review.

### Risk stratified monitoring for methotrexate toxicity in immune mediated inflammatory diseases: Prognostic model development and validation using primary care data from the UK [^1131w6BR]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

In the United Kingdom, the initial prescription for methotrexate and dose escalation occurs in hospital outpatient clinics. During this period, hospital specialists organize the monitoring of blood tests and respond to abnormal results. Once a patient's treatment is established — that is, a stable, well-tolerated, and effective methotrexate dose is reached, typically about six months after the start of treatment — GPs take on the responsibility of prescribing for and monitoring patients with periodic blood tests according to NHS shared care protocols. During shared care prescribing, GPs seek advice about side effects from hospital specialists, including abnormal blood test results, and the hospital specialists direct changes to treatment.

Patients were followed up from 180 days after their first prescription for methotrexate in primary care to the earliest of the outcome, drug discontinuation for any reason, leaving the practice, last data collection from the practice, death, five years, or 31 December 2019.

The outcome of interest was methotrexate toxicity-associated drug discontinuation, defined as a prescription gap of ≥ 90 days with either an abnormal blood test result or a diagnostic code for an abnormal blood test result within ± 60 days of the last prescription date. The thresholds for abnormal blood test results were: total leucocyte count 100 IU/mL, and decline in kidney function.

### Methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis [^114gp3Fh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease associated with joint damage, impaired function, pain, and reduced quality of life. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms, attenuate disease activity, and prevent the progression of the disease.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and www.clinicaltrials.gov for relevant records. We searched all databases from inception to 29 January 2018. We handsearched included articles for additional records and contacted study authors for additional unpublished data. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared methotrexate versus placebo, or versus another DMARD, for adults with psoriatic arthritis. We reported on the following major outcomes: disease response (measured by psoriatic arthritis response criteria (PsARC)), function (measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire for Rheumatoid Arthritis (HAQ)), health-related quality of life, disease activity (measured by disease activity score (28 joints) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR)), radiographic progression, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently reviewed search results, assessed risk of bias, extracted trial data, and assessed the quality of evidence.

### Methotrexate for ankylosing spondylitis [^111nYhcM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by sacroiliitis and spondylitis. Generally, treatment is limited to the alleviation of symptoms using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recently, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been used for patients for whom NSAIDs do not work. Methotrexate (MTX), a widely used DMARD, is effective for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and might be effective for AS too.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MTX for treating AS.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted searches in any language in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to November 20, 2005), EMBASE (1980 to November 20, 2005), CINAHL (1982 to November 20, 2005), and the reference sections of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials examining the efficacy of MTX versus placebo, other medication, or no medication for AS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed unblinded trial reports for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and entered trial data into RevMan 4.2 using the double-entry facility. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results for continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference. Relative risk was used for dichotomous data.

- **Main results**: Three trials, involving 116 patients, were included. One 12-month trial compared naproxen plus MTX with naproxen alone. Two 24-week trials compared different treatment regimes.

### Update 2011: Leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis - strengths and weaknesses [^114LVwsE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of review**: Leflunomide is often used as a first-choice disease-modifying antirheumatic drug after methotrexate. New data are available for efficacy and safety in both monotherapy and combination with biologicals.

- **Recent findings**: New data on efficacy demonstrate comparable effect sizes for leflunomide and methotrexate in the treatment of signs and symptoms in combination with tumor necrosis factor-blocking agents and rituximab. Equipotency has also been demonstrated by a recent radiographic outcome study on methotrexate and leflunomide monotherapy. Pharmacogenetic studies indicate an impact of polymorphisms on the variability in serum levels of the compound with potential relevance to effectiveness and tolerability in individual patients. Genetic factors are also likely to contribute to the significantly increased risk for leflunomide-induced pulmonary disease reported in Asia. Pre-existing interstitial lung disease and methotrexate-induced pneumonitis have been identified as risk factors for leflunomide-induced pulmonary disease, which limits the use of leflunomide as an alternative to methotrexate under these conditions.

- **Summary**: The effectiveness of leflunomide renders it a potent treatment option in rheumatoid arthritis. The known tolerability issues resulting in less favorable adherence to therapy constitute a weakness. However, documented data from large registries indicate that leflunomide is safe as far as contraindications and recommendations for monitoring are regarded.

### SPL drug information for methotrexate [^116Mseax]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of methotrexate PO (also known as Trexall, Jylamvo, Xatmep, Rasuvo, Otrexup):

- **Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis**: Use extreme caution in patients with gastrointestinal diseases such as peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis.

- **Folate deficiency**: Maintain a high level of suspicion in patients treated for non-neoplastic disease, as folate deficiency may increase adverse effects. In patients treated for neoplastic conditions, folic product administration may result in decreased efficacy of methotrexate.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure. Monitor liver tests at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated.

- **Infection**: Use caution with live vaccines. Vaccinations should be in accordance with vaccination guidelines prior to initiating methotrexate therapy.

- **Infertility, menstrual irregularity**: Use caution in patients (male or female) of child-bearing age.

- **Liver cirrhosis, ALF**: Use caution in patients with alcohol use disorder, alcoholic liver disease, or other chronic hepatic diseases.

- **Myelosuppression**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Obtain a CBC at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for clinical complications of myelosuppression.

### The pharmacogenetics of methotrexate [^114XLsqd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not universally effective, and up to one-third of patients fail to respond to treatment either because of inefficacy or adverse events. At present, it is not possible to predict therapy response accurately. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to heredity. MTX has a complex intracellular metabolism and acts via a number of key enzymes. This review critically appraises the studies of MTX pharmacogenetics and highlights the need for further work in this area.

### Jylamvo [^11116QnE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Refer to the full prescribing information for drug interactions with Jylamvo.

- **Effects of other drugs on methotrexate**:

	- **Drugs that increase methotrexate exposure**: Coadministration of methotrexate with certain products may increase methotrexate plasma concentrations, leading to a higher risk of severe adverse reactions. This coadministration can also reduce the formation of active metabolites, thereby decreasing the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Increased organ-specific adverse reactions may occur when methotrexate is combined with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic products. If coadministration cannot be avoided, closely monitor for methotrexate adverse reactions when combined with:

		- Oral antibiotics (including neomycin)
		- Oral or intravenous penicillin or sulfonamide antibiotics
		- Antifolate drugs (e.g. dapsone, pemetrexed, pyrimethamine, and sulfonamides)
		- Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
		- Hepatotoxic products
		- Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g. oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and tetracyclines)
		- Probenecid
		- Proton pump inhibitors
		- Weak acids (e.g. salicylates)
		- Nephrotoxic products

	- **Nitrous oxide**: Coadministration of methotrexate with nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effects of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, increasing the risk of severe adverse reactions. Avoid using nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Consider alternative therapies.

### Appropriate and effective management of rheumatoid arthritis [^117A3EfW]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Early referral, within three months, and early DMARD treatment can significantly alter the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Once the disease becomes aggressive, it is much more challenging to treat, and the extent of improvements will likely be reduced compared to those achieved with earlier treatment. Recent strategies and treatments have made it possible for many more patients to achieve remission than in the past.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis [^116Cd44i]. Rheumatology (2012). High credibility.

- **Trial design**: MIPA was a 6-month, double-blind, parallel-group RCT in which patients with active PsA were randomized to receive MTX (target dose of 15 mg/week) or a matched placebo. The allocation ratio of active to placebo treatment was 1:1.

- **Patients**: MIPA enrolled males and females aged at least 18 years with PsA currently attending UK specialist rheumatology clinics.

- **Inclusion criteria**: These comprised:
	1. Clinically apparent psoriasis (skin or nails) and active inflammatory synovitis involving at least one peripheral joint (an adaptation from the two mandatory criteria of Bennett, following the approach of Gladman and Salvarani et al.).
	2. A constant level of NSAID therapy for at least one month.
	3. Previous DMARD therapy discontinued for at least one month.
	4. Willingness and ability to give informed consent.

- **Exclusion criteria**: These comprised:
	1. Other inflammatory arthropathies or arthritis mutilans.
	2. Systemic steroid therapy currently or within the last three months.
	3. Previous treatment with MTX.
	4. Other serious medical disorders including liver, renal, and cardiac disease.
	5. Women of childbearing potential not taking adequate contraceptive precautions.
	6. Abnormal full-blood counts and liver function tests or other contraindications to MTX therapy.

- **Experimental treatment**: Patients were seen monthly to adjust their trial medication and for safety monitoring. MTX was initially given at 7.5 mg/week, increased at 4 weeks to 10 mg/week, and at 8 weeks to the target dose of 15 mg/week.

### Combination treatment strategies in early rheumatoid arthritis [^116SDLDM]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are increasingly being used in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when long-term results with sequential DMARD monotherapy are disappointing. Combination DMARD therapy may be more effective than monotherapy and has no additional short-term adverse events. However, the evidence for using combination DMARD therapy is still weak, and further trials are needed.

### Neoral [^113G5LpB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The initial dose of Neoral for rheumatoid arthritis is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is observed and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks, and again after 12 weeks, to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, Neoral therapy should be discontinued.

Dose reductions of 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, such as hypertension or elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient's pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if Neoral is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with Neoral doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline [^117AyV81]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) are uncommonly discontinued due to blood-test abnormalities after the first year of shared-care prescription, and discontinuations for severely abnormal blood-test results are even less frequent. These data will be useful when counseling patients in routine clinical practice. Elevated liver enzymes were the most common blood-test abnormality causing treatment discontinuations, underlining the need to advise patients treated with DMARDs to minimize other risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Further research is required to identify the risk factors of target-organ damage and develop a prognostic model for risk-stratified blood-test monitoring. This approach is currently being evaluated by our team in another ongoing study that will also assess the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of risk-based monitoring.

### Pain reduction with oral methotrexate in knee osteoarthritis: A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111hPsxe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) are limited. Previous small studies suggest that the antirheumatic drug methotrexate may be a potential treatment for OA pain.

- **Objective**: To assess symptomatic benefits of methotrexate in knee OA (KOA).

- **Design**: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 13 June 2014 and 13 October 2017 (ISRCTN77854383; EudraCT: 2013–001689–41).

- **Setting**: 15 secondary care musculoskeletal clinics in the United Kingdom.

- **Participants**: A total of 207 participants with symptomatic, radiographic KOA and knee pain (severity ≥ 4 out of 10) on most days in the past 3 months, with an inadequate response to medication, were approached for inclusion.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral methotrexate once weekly (6-week escalation from 10 to 25 mg) or a matched placebo over 12 months, continuing usual analgesia.

- **Measurements**: The primary endpoint was average knee pain (numerical rating scale [NRS] 0 to 10) at 6 months, with a 12-month follow-up to assess longer-term response. Secondary endpoints included knee stiffness and function outcomes and adverse events (AEs).

- **Results**: A total of 155 participants (64% women; mean age: 60.9 years; 50% Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 to 4) were randomly assigned to methotrexate (n = 77) or placebo (n = 78). Follow-up was 86% (n = 134; methotrexate: 66, placebo: 68) at 6 months. Mean knee pain decreased from 6.4 (SD, 1.80) at baseline to 5.1 (SD, 2.32) at 6 months in the methotrexate group and from 6.8 (SD, 1.62) to 6.2 (SD, 2.30) in the placebo group.

### Effects of GLPG3970 on sulfasalazine and methotrexate pharmacokinetics in healthy adults: Two open-label, phase I, drug-drug interaction studies [^116wsfHt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

In the SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study, participants received a single dose of SSZ in the morning on day 1 (treatment period 1). On the morning of day 5, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 immediately before SSZ, and on the morning of day 9, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 2 hours post-SSZ. As preliminary work demonstrated that food consumption reduced the C max of GLPG3970, all doses were administered after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. In addition, participants had to remain fasted for at least 4 hours post-SSZ dosing on day 1, day 5, and day 9.

In the MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study, participants received a single dose of MTX in the morning on day 1 (treatment period 1) and day 5 (treatment period 2), after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours to maximize GLPG3970 exposure. On day 1, participants had to remain fasted for at least 4 hours post-MTX dosing. On day 5, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 immediately before MTX and then remained fasted for at least 4 hours. On days 6–8, participants had to be fasted for at least 2 hours in the morning before receiving GLPG3970 and were then allowed breakfast 1 hour post-GLPG3970 dosing.

In the SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study, blood samples were collected for PK analyses of SSZ and SPD before each SSZ dosing and at regular intervals up to 72 hours after each SSZ dosing. For PK analyses of GLPG3970, blood samples were collected before GLPG3970 dosing and at intervals up to 24 hours post-dosing on days 5 and 9 when GLPG3970 was coadministered with SSZ. In the MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study, blood samples were collected to assess pharmacokinetics.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline [^112PdUQS]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, our findings are not applicable to patients at very high risk of drug toxicity and not transferred to shared-care prescribing, such as those with CKD-4 or pre-existing chronic liver disease. However, it is extremely uncommon to offer methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) to such patients, and the results of our study will therefore apply to the vast majority of autoimmune rheumatic disease (AIRD) patients.

Secondly, dose data were missing for the majority of MTX and a large proportion of LEF prescriptions, which limits the validity of dose-reduction analysis. Thirdly, CKD progression and a serum creatinine increase of > 26 μmol/l, the minimum change required to consider the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI), was used to ascertain drug discontinuation with kidney function decline. The guideline specifies that the increase in creatinine should occur within 48 hours. We were unable to meet this part of the definition due to inherent large gaps between blood tests, potentially resulting in an overestimate of the incidence of AKI. Our results therefore represent a worst-case scenario with respect to the impact on kidney function.

Some of the abnormal blood test results could be due to the concomitant prescription of other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as sulfasalazine (SSZ). This can potentially elevate the outcome event rate. However, it is unlikely to play a large part as our outcome definition required a prescription gap of at least 90 days. It is reasonable to expect that, in this period, most rheumatologists will be able to ascertain the actual drug responsible for the blood-test abnormality. Moreover, some patients prescribed first-line subcutaneous MTX for rheumatoid arthritis…

### Management of RA medications in pregnant patients [^115MXnPG]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

The desire for children or the presence of pregnancy limits the drug therapy options for a woman with rheumatoid arthritis. Combination therapies that include methotrexate or new drugs that have not been studied or used in pregnant patients must be excluded, even though they might be highly efficacious. With few exceptions, the reason for this exclusion is not the proven teratogenicity of the drugs but the absence of proven safety for the fetus.

Methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept, and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, whereas tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, and ciclosporin are compatible with pregnancy and can be administered until birth. Corticosteroids and analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) can also be used throughout pregnancy. NSAIDs can be safely administered until gestational week 32.

The most important consideration when managing rheumatoid arthritis medications during pregnancy is that therapy must be tailored for the individual patient according to disease activity.

Medication guide for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- **What is the most important information I should know about medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?** NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including an increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. Do not take NSAIDs right before or following a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)". Avoid taking NSAIDs following a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs following a recent heart attack.

- **Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines**: This risk can occur at any time during use, without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with a past history of stomach ulcers or stomach or intestinal bleeding with the use of NSAIDs, and taking medicines called "corticosteroids", "anticoagulants", "SSRIs", or "SNRIs".

### Soft tissue enlargement of fingers in a teenager [^116q3QjT]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is/are the next best step(s) in management of this condition?
	- **A. Avoid mechanical trauma** – Correct. Repetitive mechanical trauma is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of pachydermodactyly. Cell proliferation and expression of integrin β1, cytoskeleton p130Cas, TGF β1, and type I collagen are increased in skin that has been exposed to mechanical stress.
	- **B. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral bisphosphonates** – Incorrect. This combination is often used in the management of pachydermoperiostosis.
	- **C. Surgical excision** – Incorrect. Surgical excision is rarely needed for pachydermodactyly as it is typically asymptomatic and nonprogressive.
	- **D. Intravenous corticosteroid and methotrexate** – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroid in addition to methotrexate would be inappropriate treatment for pachydermodactyly due to absence of an inflammatory arthropathy.
	- **E. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)** – Incorrect. The early use of DMARDs has proved beneficial in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis; however, these aggressive immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents would also be inappropriate for management of pachydermodactyly due to the benign nature of the disease.

### Canadian recommendations for use of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112CPs9p]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to develop recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Methods**: Canadian rheumatologists who participated in the international 3e Initiative in Rheumatology (evidence, expertise, exchange) in 2007–2008 formulated five unique Canadian questions. A bibliographic team systematically reviewed the relevant literature on these five topics. An expert committee consisting of 26 rheumatologists from across Canada was convened, and a set of recommendations was proposed based on the results of systematic reviews combined with expert opinions using a nominal group consensus process.

- **Results**: The five questions addressed drug interactions, predictors of response, strategies to reduce non-serious side effects, variables to assess clinical response, and incorporating patient preference into decision-making. The systematic review retrieved 93 pertinent articles; this evidence was presented to the expert committee during the interactive workshop. After extensive discussion and voting, a total of nine recommendations were formulated: two on drug interactions, one on predictors of response, two on strategies to reduce non-serious side effects, three on variables to assess clinical response, and one on incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The level of evidence and the strength of recommendations are reported. Agreement among panelists ranged from 85% to 100%.

In conclusion, nine recommendations pertaining to the use of MTX in daily practice were developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert/physician consensus with high level of agreement.

### Methotrexate for ankylosing spondylitis [^116qKzLo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by sacroiliitis and spondylitis. At the time of writing, treatment of AS has been limited to the alleviation of symptoms, mainly using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients refractory or intolerant to NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been used as a second-line approach. Methotrexate (MTX) is currently one of the most widely used DMARDs, and its efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been confirmed. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether MTX is effective in treating AS.

- **Objectives**:
	- To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

- **Search strategy**:
	- Relevant randomized and quasi-randomized trials in any language were sought using the following sources: CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 4, 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003 Week 26), CINAHL (1982 to June Week 3, 2003), and the reference section of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- We evaluated randomized and quasi-randomized trials examining the efficacy of methotrexate on AS.

- **Data collection and analysis**:
	- Unblinded trial reports were reviewed independently by two reviewers according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of studies were resolved, where necessary, by recourse to a third reviewer. The methodological quality of included trials was independently assessed by the same reviewers on randomization, concealment, and blindness.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for axial spondyloarthritis, particularly in managing active disease, DMARDs, and ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis despite treatment with NSAIDs. It is advised to consider initiating sulfasalazine or methotrexate only in patients with prominent peripheral arthritis or when TNF inhibitors are not available.

### Early start and stop of biologics: Has the time come [^113o6JQ1]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Abbreviations used in the study include: DMARDs for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, MTX for methotrexate, RA for rheumatoid arthritis, and TNF for tumor necrosis factor.

The study evaluates the potential implications of early initiation and cessation of biologics in the treatment regimen for rheumatoid arthritis. Consideration is given to the balance between treatment efficacy, safety, and long-term patient outcomes. Analysis of existing clinical data suggests that while there may be benefits to early intervention with biologics, patient-specific factors must guide decisions regarding treatment duration.

The discussion highlights the need for ongoing research to establish clear guidelines, considering the variability in patient responses to biologic therapy. It emphasizes an individualized approach to the management of rheumatoid arthritis, taking into account the drug's impact on immune modulation and potential side effects.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: A mixed-methods systematic review [^113CnmD8]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Accepting the need for MTX

Many people wanted information to help them understand the use of methotrexate (MTX) in the context of inflammatory arthritis (IA). This included information about IA, drug treatments, and how IA was likely to affect them in the future. There was variation in preferences for the timing, content, and format of information about IA and MTX. Some individuals felt overwhelmed when newly diagnosed with IA, experiencing difficulty in absorbing extensive information, particularly when also receiving MTX information. This led some to accept rheumatologists' recommendations to start MTX without adequately reflecting on the information, reducing the opportunity for shared decision-making. Many people were unable to recall information they had received about their diagnosis and MTX, while some did not recall receiving any information at all. However, receiving information at diagnosis to support acceptance of the need for treatment and the development of self-management skills was important for some.

Adjusting to a diagnosis of IA was seen as a process; some described losing their identity while learning to live with IA. For some individuals, the adjustment process took several years, sometimes resulting in difficulties accepting the need for treatment. Treatment with MTX was accepted by others due to the impact of IA on their daily life, which led them to seek relief from pain and an improved quality of life. Some who witnessed others with IA struggling with pain and disability, or responding well to treatment with MTX, found it easier to accept MTX. Those experiencing fewer symptoms and less impact on their daily lives often faced challenges in accepting the need for treatment.

### Methotrexate monotherapy and methotrexate combination therapy with traditional and biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis: A network meta-analysis [^113eZeHw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Methotrexate is considered the preferred disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but controversy exists on the additional benefits and harms of combining methotrexate with other DMARDs.

- **Objectives**: To compare methotrexate and methotrexate-based DMARD combinations for rheumatoid arthritis in patients naïve to or with an inadequate response (IR) to methotrexate.

- **Methods**: We systematically identified all randomized controlled trials with methotrexate monotherapy or in combination with any currently used conventional synthetic DMARD, biologic DMARDs, or tofacitinib. Three major outcomes (ACR50 response, radiographic progression, and withdrawals due to adverse events) and multiple minor outcomes were evaluated. Treatment effects were summarized using Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses, separately for methotrexate-naïve and methotrexate-IR trials. Heterogeneity was explored through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. The risk of bias of each trial was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and trials at high risk of bias were excluded from the main analysis. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. A comparison between two treatments was considered statistically significant if its credible interval excluded the null effect, indicating > 97.5% probability that one treatment was superior.

- **Main results**: 158 trials with over 37,000 patients were included. Methotrexate-naïve: Several treatment combinations with methotrexate were statistically superior to oral methotrexate for AC.

### Drug interactions in inflammatory bowel disease [^115TPWhc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often require a combination of drugs, some of which are taken for many years, to control their disease. Some of these drugs have potentially serious side effects, which may be initiated or exacerbated by interaction with other agents used to treat IBD. Furthermore, patients with IBD may take treatment for other, unrelated conditions. It is important for doctors who manage patients with IBD to be aware of, and thereby minimize, the dangers presented by such drug interactions. In this review, we summarize the common and important interactions of drugs used in patients with IBD, including some that may be of therapeutic benefit. Particular attention is paid to interactions that occur where both drugs are used to treat IBD.

### Combined treatment of giant-cell arteritis with methotrexate and prednisone. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117YG7ry]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy for giant-cell arteritis, but relapse during dose tapering and corticosteroid-related adverse events often complicate the management of this condition. Although several approaches, including combined therapy with cytotoxic agents, have been suggested to overcome these problems, no study has clearly shown benefits of alternate treatments.

- **Objective**: To analyze the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with corticosteroids and methotrexate in giant-cell arteritis.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: University-based clinic.

- **Patients**: 42 patients with new-onset giant-cell arteritis according to biopsy.

- **Intervention**: High initial doses of corticosteroid were given; the dose was then tapered quickly until therapy was completely withdrawn. Methotrexate or placebo was given weekly from the start of corticosteroid therapy for 24 months.

- **Measurements**: Number of relapses, cumulative dose of corticosteroid, and number of adverse events were assessed on completion of follow-up.

- **Results**: Compared with combined prednisone and placebo therapy, treatment with prednisone and methotrexate reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one relapse (45% vs. 84.2%; P = 0.02) and the proportion of patients who experienced multiple relapses (P = 0.004). The mean cumulative dose of prednisone was 4187 ± 1529 mg in the methotrexate group and 5489.5 ± 1396 mg in the placebo group (mean difference, 1302 mg [95% CI, 350 to 2253 mg]; P = 0.009). Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events were diminished, indicating a favorable outcome for the combined treatment approach.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: a mixed-methods systematic review [^112tVRtg]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

People with inflammatory arthritis have individual information and support needs when starting methotrexate. Addressing these needs supports individuals in initiating and continuing methotrexate therapy. One-size-fits-all approaches to providing information about methotrexate do not meet individual needs.

### Two drug interaction studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of pemetrexed when coadministered with aspirin or ibuprofen in patients with advanced cancer [^1113Wggn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Pemetrexed is an antimetabolite that is structurally similar to methotrexate. Because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) impair methotrexate clearance and increase its toxicity, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of pemetrexed when coadministered with aspirin or ibuprofen in advanced cancer patients.

- **Experimental design**: In two independent, randomized, crossover drug interaction studies, cancer patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min received an NSAID (aspirin or ibuprofen) with either the first or the second dose of pemetrexed (cycle 1 or 2). Pemetrexed (500 mg/m²) was infused intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, and all patients were supplemented with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B₁₂. Aspirin (325 mg) or ibuprofen (400 mg; 2 x 200 mg) was given orally every 6 hours, starting 2 days before pemetrexed administration, with the ninth and final dose taken 1 hour before infusion. Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics with and without concomitant NSAID treatment were compared for cycles 1 and 2.

- **Results**: Data from 27 patients in each study were evaluable for the analysis of pemetrexed pharmacokinetics. Coadministration of aspirin did not alter pemetrexed pharmacokinetics; however, ibuprofen coadministration was associated with a 16% reduction in clearance, a 15% increase in maximum plasma concentration, and a 20% increase in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve but no significant change in V(ss) compared with pemetrexed alone. No febrile neutropenia occurred in any patient, and no increase in pemetrexed-related toxicity was observed.

### Baricitinib, methotrexate, or combination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and no or limited prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment [^111sHYik]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The RA‐BEGIN study was a 52‐week, randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, active comparator–controlled trial conducted at 198 centers in 18 countries. Patients were randomized in a 4:3:4 ratio to receive oral methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy (once weekly), baricitinib monotherapy (4 mg once daily), or a combination of baricitinib and MTX. MTX commenced at 10 mg/week and, if tolerated, increased to 20 mg/week by week 8. An alternative lower dosage regimen was provided if clinically indicated, starting at 7.5 mg once weekly with a maximum of 12.5 mg once weekly.

Randomization was stratified by geographic region and baseline radiographic evidence of joint erosions. Patients with a screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between ≥ 40 and < 60 ml/minute/1.73 m² receiving baricitinib monotherapy or the combination therapy were allocated a baricitinib dose of 2 mg. Concomitant treatment with stable doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and/or oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day) was allowed.

Baricitinib and matching placebo were provided as 4‐mg and 2‐mg tablets. Active and placebo MTX were supplied as identical opaque capsules, containing either excipient alone or with commercially available MTX. Folic acid was supplied as a non-investigational product by the sponsor, with all patients required to take at least 1 mg daily, or in accordance with local standards of care.

Rescue treatment, consisting of baricitinib plus MTX, was available for patients whose tender and swollen joint counts did not improve by ≥ 20% from baseline.

### Otrexup [^115cqudz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate, usually in high dosage, along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. Liver biopsy after sustained use often shows histologic changes, and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported; these latter lesions may not be preceded by symptoms or abnormal liver function tests in the psoriasis population. For this reason, periodic liver biopsies are usually recommended for psoriatic patients under long-term treatment. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede the appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It is not always fully reversible, and fatalities have been reported. Pulmonary symptoms, especially a dry, nonproductive cough, may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Drug-induced comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis [^1175TtpB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Safety considerations also include the co-administration of other drugs. However, the clinical importance of the interaction between low-dose methotrexate (LD MTX) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), penicillin, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) cannot be substantiated and is only rarely clinically relevant. Since MTX is a folate analogue that antagonizes the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and disrupts DNA synthesis, DNA damage repair, and cellular replication, folate supplementation is strongly recommended with MTX therapy. As stated by Beduoi et al, some of the MTX-associated side effects may be related to its mechanism of action.

Gavrysyuk et al. demonstrated that in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, LD MTX monotherapy does not differ significantly from methylprednisolone monotherapy in terms of efficacy and adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurrence. Increasing the MTX dose from 10 to 15 mg/week accelerated the regression rates of sarcoidosis, improved treatment efficacy, and did not change ADR frequency. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of treatment resistance and relapse rate. Consistent with this, a randomized controlled trial among patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis is investigating the effectiveness and tolerability of MTX as first-line therapy compared with prednisone. If this study confirms the hypothesis that LD MTX is as effective as prednisone as a first-line treatment with fewer ADRs, it will have a major clinical impact.

### Prediction of methotrexate efficacy and adverse events in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A systematic literature review [^111vFeqg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatologic disorder, with a prevalence of 16–150 per 100,000 children. It is characterized by chronic arthritis of unknown etiology, lasting at least six weeks, with an onset before 16 years of age. JIA is a heterogeneous group of disorders, with manifestations ranging from relatively mild inflammation of a single joint to severe involvement of multiple joints lasting into adulthood, leading to structural joint damage and incapacity. These long-term sequelae should be avoided, and it is thought that early and effective therapy in the so-called window of opportunity is crucial in achieving this.

The most widely used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of JIA is methotrexate (MTX), which has been used for more than 25 years. It is an inexpensive and safe drug, beneficial in around 70% of JIA patients. Other treatment options include intra-articular joint injections or the more potent biologicals for MTX or corticosteroid-resistant cases. It is still impossible to predict the individual prognosis and, hence, the treatment requirements at the onset of the disease, leading to the step-up approach of starting MTX and adding a biological if the patient does not respond sufficiently well to MTX monotherapy. However, given the aforementioned goal to start effective treatment immediately to prevent joint damage, and the fact that MTX monotherapy is completely ineffective in around 30% of patients, it is essential to know beforehand who is going to respond well to treatment.
