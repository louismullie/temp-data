## Question

Given Hyperlipidemia (HLD) and continuing atorvastatin, with a lipid panel showing cholesterol 143 mg/dL, triglycerides 268 mg/dL (H), HDL 44 mg/dL, and LDL (direct) 69 mg/dL, should I add any additional medications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, in a statin‑treated patient with LDL‑C 69 mg/dL and triglycerides 268 mg/dL, any additional medications should be added. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the lipid phenotype and ensuring LDL‑C is truly at goal. Then, I should verify and rule out secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Next, I will assess overall ASCVD risk, because this drives whether outcome‑proven add‑on therapy is warranted. After that, I will review guideline‑supported pharmacologic choices for residual triglyceride‑driven risk with controlled LDL‑C. Finally, I need to cover lifestyle therapy, safety issues, and follow‑up monitoring plans before stating a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the lipid phenotype and targets. LDL‑C at 69 mg/dL on atorvastatin suggests the LDL‑C‑driven portion of therapy is adequate for high‑ or very‑high‑risk prevention thresholds that use 70 mg/dL as a key cutpoint, while triglycerides at 268 mg/dL fall into the moderate hypertriglyceridemia range (150–499 mg/dL), which is the residual abnormality we now need to address without de‑escalating statin therapy [^115JUt2M].

> Wait, let me verify secondary contributors before adding therapy. I need to check for uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, excess alcohol, and medications that raise triglycerides; practically, that means ordering fasting glucose or HbA1c, TSH, basic metabolic and hepatic panels, reviewing alcohol intake, and auditing the medication list for offenders, because correcting a reversible driver can substantially lower triglycerides and refine the need for add‑on therapy [^111mwmAv].

> Next, I should review global cardiovascular risk to prioritize outcome‑proven options. If the patient has diabetes mellitus and is already on statin therapy with LDL‑C at goal but triglycerides persistently 135–499 mg/dL, or has established ASCVD, guidelines elevate the role of triglyceride‑targeted add‑on therapy to reduce events, whereas in lower‑risk primary prevention we emphasize lifestyle first and consider pharmacotherapy only selectively [^115JUt2M].

> Now, I will examine what the most recent guidelines say about triglyceride lowering when LDL‑C is controlled. The ADA 2025 Standards recommend adding icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily in adults with diabetes on statin whose LDL‑C is at goal and triglycerides are 135–499 mg/dL to reduce cardiovascular events, and the 2019 AHA/ACC guideline notes triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL as a risk‑enhancing factor and supports consideration of prescription‑strength omega‑3, specifically icosapent ethyl, when LDL‑C is < 100 mg/dL, which is consistent with REDUCE‑IT's profile and outcome benefit [^115JUt2M]. I initially thought there was a 2022 BMJ clinical practice guideline that issued a strong recommendation for icosapent ethyl in this setting as well.

> Hmm, wait a minute — hold on, I should verify that BMJ citation. On double‑checking, the 2022 BMJ guideline I was recalling addresses PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe in LDL‑C lowering rather than icosapent ethyl, so my initial attribution was incorrect; thanks to that correction, I will instead anchor the EPA recommendation to ADA 2025, AHA/ACC 2019, and the Endocrine Society guidance that suggests eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester for statin‑treated T2DM patients at LDL goal with residual triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and additional risk factors, with CCS 2021 also acknowledging event reduction with icosapent ethyl in appropriate high‑risk patients [^112SYNSK] [^115JUt2M] [^115JUt2M] [^115JUt2M].

> But wait, what if this is primary prevention without diabetes or established ASCVD? Let me reconsider the threshold for adding EPA. In lower‑risk patients, guidelines emphasize intensifying lifestyle and glycemic optimization first, and only consider icosapent ethyl selectively when triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL alongside multiple risk enhancers; this is more conditional and requires shared decision‑making given the weaker evidence base outside diabetes or ASCVD cohorts [^notfound].

> I should also clarify alternatives. If triglycerides were to rise to ≥ 500 mg/dL, pancreatitis risk becomes the priority and a fibrate, preferably fenofibrate when combined with a statin to reduce myopathy risk, is favored acutely; however, at 268 mg/dL, fibrates have uncertain cardiovascular outcome benefit on top of statins and are not first‑line for event reduction, and niacin is generally not recommended due to side effects and lack of clear outcome benefit in this context; ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors primarily target LDL‑C, which is already controlled here, so they do not address the residual triglyceride‑driven risk [^115JUt2M].

> Let me not jump to conclusions without reinforcing lifestyle measures, because they remain foundational. I need to ensure weight reduction if overweight or obese, regular aerobic activity, dietary reduction of refined carbohydrates and fructose, limitation of alcohol especially with triglycerides > 200 mg/dL, and consideration of dietary omega‑3 intake; these interventions are guideline‑mandated for triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and should proceed in parallel even if we add pharmacotherapy [^114G5pke] [^115JUt2M].

> Safety and monitoring now need confirmation. Icosapent ethyl is generally well tolerated but has a modestly increased rate of atrial fibrillation and bleeding events, which matters if the patient is on antiplatelets or anticoagulants; after any therapy change, I should recheck a fasting lipid panel in 4–12 weeks to confirm movement toward triglycerides < 150 mg/dL and continue periodic monitoring every 3–12 months, and if a fibrate is ever introduced with a statin, I should monitor for myopathy and use fenofibrate rather than gemfibrozil to minimize interaction risk [^115AYRHQ] [^112KRRTu] [^115JUt2M].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure we continue the statin with LDL‑C already at 69 mg/dL, evaluate and correct secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, intensify lifestyle therapy, and — if the patient has diabetes, established ASCVD, or high‑risk primary prevention features with persistent triglycerides 135–499 mg/dL — add icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily to reduce cardiovascular events; reserving fibrate therapy for scenarios where triglycerides reach ≥ 500 mg/dL or pancreatitis risk predominates, with follow‑up lipids in 4–12 weeks to document response and guide further care [^115JUt2M] [^112KRRTu] [^112KRRTu] [^115AYRHQ].

---

No, do not add more medications at this time. The patient is on atorvastatin with LDL-C at goal and triglycerides < 500 mg/dL [^115JUt2M]. Current guidelines recommend intensifying lifestyle measures and optimizing glycemic control first [^114G5pke]; add icosapent ethyl only if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite these steps and the patient has ASCVD or is at high cardiovascular risk [^113BgXDn]. Recheck a fasting lipid panel in 4–12 weeks [^112KRRTu] after lifestyle changes; consider pharmacologic therapy only if triglycerides are persistently ≥ 500 mg/dL or if ASCVD risk is high and triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL [^115JUt2M].

## Current lipid profile analysis

| **Lipid parameter** | **Current value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total cholesterol | 143 mg/dL | < 200 mg/dL | Within normal limits |
| Triglycerides (TG) | 268 mg/dL | < 150 mg/dL | Elevated |
| HDL cholesterol | 44 mg/dL | - ≥ 40 mg/dL (men) <br/> - ≥ 50 mg/dL (women) | Borderline low |
| LDL cholesterol (direct) | 69 mg/dL | < 100 mg/dL | At goal |

---

LDL cholesterol is at goal (< 100 mg/dL), consistent with guideline targets for primary prevention and most secondary prevention scenarios [^1158JvLe]. Triglycerides are moderately elevated (200–499 mg/dL) but remain below the 500 mg/dL threshold where pharmacologic therapy is strongly indicated to prevent pancreatitis [^115JUt2M]. HDL cholesterol is borderline low, and pharmacologically raising HDL is not recommended due to lack of cardiovascular benefit [^116i9kih].

## Guideline recommendations for triglyceride management

Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) provide clear recommendations for managing elevated triglycerides in statin-treated patients:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: First-line therapy for triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL [^114G5pke], including dietary changes, weight loss, increased physical activity, and glycemic control [^117FuEpU].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Consider icosapent ethyl (EPA) [^115JUt2M] if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy in patients with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk [^113BgXDn].
- **Fibrates or niacin**: Not routinely recommended unless triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL due to limited cardiovascular benefit and potential adverse effects [^115JUt2M].

---

## Clinical decision-making considerations

Before adding medications, several clinical factors should be considered:

- **Cardiovascular risk assessment**: Determine if the patient has established ASCVD or is at high cardiovascular risk, which would influence the decision to add icosapent ethyl [^115F1cN3].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Assess adherence to lifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, weight management, and alcohol intake [^117JUPp4].
- **Secondary causes**: Evaluate for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, such as uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, or medication-induced dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv].
- **Patient preferences and adherence**: Consider patient preferences, potential side effects, and adherence to current therapy [^115e6wUP].

---

## Recommended next steps

Given the current lipid profile and guideline recommendations, intensify lifestyle modifications [^114G5pke] through dietary changes (reduce saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and alcohol intake), weight management (aim for 5–10% weight loss if overweight or obese), regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), and optimize glycemic control if diabetic or prediabetic. Re-evaluate with a fasting lipid panel in 4–12 weeks after implementing lifestyle changes to assess response [^112KRRTu] [^117F7QE1]. Consider pharmacologic therapy if triglycerides remain ≥ 500 mg/dL [^115JUt2M] (add fibrates or omega-3 fatty acids to prevent pancreatitis), or if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy and the patient has ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk (consider adding icosapent ethyl) [^113BgXDn].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the current lipid profile, the patient is at LDL cholesterol goal, and triglycerides are moderately elevated but below the threshold for immediate pharmacologic intervention. Current guidelines recommend intensifying lifestyle modifications and reassessing the lipid profile before adding medications [^117FuEpU]. Therefore, additional medications are not recommended at this time. Re-evaluate after lifestyle changes, and consider pharmacologic therapy only if triglycerides remain elevated or if the patient is at high cardiovascular risk [^115Qq6KL].

- **Dyslipidemia/lipid management**:

- **Screening**: In most adult patients, measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dl, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every two years.

- **Treatment recommendations and goals**: Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; increase of n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber, and plant stanols/sterols; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes.

	- Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients with overt CVD. Additionally, statin therapy is recommended for those without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors. For lower-risk patients (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors.

	- In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). For those with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal.

	- Triglyceride levels should ideally be maintained at < 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l).

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning female patients, the CCS 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining screening with a complete lipid panel in the late postpartum period for female patients who experienced pregnancy complications. These complications pose a higher risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, typically occurring 10–15 years after the index delivery:

- **Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy**
- **Gestational diabetes**
- **Preterm birth**
- **Stillbirth**
- **Low birth weight infant**
- **Placental abruption**

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [^116LHhiW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, five major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical endpoints have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C.

- **Major recommendations for modifications**:

	- In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL. However, when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, i.e. a reasonable clinical strategy, based on available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL.

	- Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can…

### Advicor [^115CTEtr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk-factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Refer to Table 8 and the NCEP treatment guidelines for further details.

Advicor, which consists of niacin extended-release and lovastatin, is indicated for use when treatment with both Niaspan and lovastatin is appropriate. The components of Advicor are both indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Patients receiving treatment with Advicor should be on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet and should continue on this diet during treatment.

- **Niaspan (niacin extended-release)**:
	- **Hypercholesterolemia**: Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (see Table 7), when the response to an appropriate diet has been inadequate.
	- **Secondary prevention of cardiovascular events**: In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.
	- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high triglyceride levels.

### Waiting for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel IV guidelines, and in the meantime, some challenges and recommendations [^114MAbhB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) has provided education and guidance for decades on the management of hypercholesterolemia. Its third report (ATP III) was published 10 years ago, with a white paper update in 2004. There is a need for translation of more recent evidence into a revised guideline. To help address the significant challenges facing the ATP IV writing group, this statement aims to provide balanced recommendations that build on ATP III. The authors aim for simplicity to increase the likelihood of implementation in clinical practice. To move from ATP III to ATP IV, the authors recommend the following:

- **Assess risk more accurately**: This involves improving the accuracy of risk assessment models used in guidelines.
- **Simplify the starting algorithm**: Make the initial steps for treatment easier to follow.
- **Prioritize statin therapy**: Emphasize statin usage in treatment plans.
- **Relax the follow-up interval for repeat lipid testing**: Lengthening the time between tests may streamline the process without compromising results.
- **Designate < 70 mg/dL as an "ideal" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target**: Set a clear and specific target for patient treatment.
- **Endorse targets beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol**: Consider additional metrics for evaluating cholesterol-related health risks.
- **Refine therapeutic target levels to the equivalent population percentile**: Base target levels on percentile ranks within the population.
- **Remove misleading descriptors such as "borderline high"**: Eliminate terms that could be misinterpreted or lack specificity.
- **Make lifestyle messages simpler**: Simplify lifestyle recommendations to enhance patient compliance.

In conclusion, the solutions offered in this statement represent ways to translate the totality of published reports into enhanced hyperlipidemia guidelines to better combat the devastating impact of hyperlipidemia on cardiovascular health.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically with respect to screening for dyslipidemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a lipid profile at the initiation of statins or other lipid-lowering therapy. A follow-up lipid profile should be conducted 4–12 weeks after initiation or a change in dose, and annually thereafter, to facilitate monitoring the response to therapy and inform medication-taking behavior.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111LRNyB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

- **Evidence for the underuse of lipid‐lowering therapies in clinical practice**: Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of more than 600,000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

- **Management of lipid levels**: Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of approximately 1.5 million patients with a history of one or more major ASCVD events reported that over 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a two-year period, two-thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment adjustments necessary to meet the guideline-recommended targets.

Since the publication of ATP III, five major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical endpoints have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They advocate the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C.

- **Major recommendations for ATP III treatment algorithm modifications**: In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL. However, when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, a reasonable clinical strategy based on available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option also extends to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Furthermore, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to management adjustments.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining lipoprotein(a) levels at least once in each adult person's lifetime. This is to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels above 180 mg/dL (over 430 mmol/L), which carry a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^114ViDfq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Many medications widely prescribed for patients with T2DM influence, to varying degrees, selected components of the routine lipid profile (i.e. LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels) and, consequently, potentially the risk for ASCVD. While some effects may be significant, many medications are associated with relatively small changes in the lipid profile and are therefore unlikely to affect ASCVD risk by themselves. However, the cumulative effect in patients taking multiple medications may be significant and should not be overlooked. The net effects of these medications on the lipid profile, in addition to effects on other factors related to CV health, should be anticipated, and their overall potential impact on ASCVD risk should be considered. Therefore, clinicians can help to ensure optimal care and avoid putting patients at unnecessary risk by performing ongoing lipid-panel monitoring, taking into account potential effects of commonly prescribed medications. Ultimately, lifestyle recommendations and lipid-lowering agents are required to target atherogenic cholesterol and achieve the appropriate goals determined by the absolute risk for an individual, especially those with a relatively higher absolute risk (i.e. patients with diabetes).

### Contemporary national patterns of eligibility and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies in the United States [^116nuuZD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In this nationally representative US study, fewer than half of individuals who had guideline indications for lipid lowering with statins were receiving these agents, with particular underuse among Black adults and younger adults aged 40 to 64 years. Furthermore, based on the lipid profiles of US adults and their existing therapies, 9.7 million or 6.5% of those over 40 years of age would merit consideration for PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i). Additionally, 11.6 million or 7.8% of those in this age group would benefit from a reduced risk of cardiovascular adverse events with the initiation of icosapent ethyl (IPE). However, a substantial proportion of individuals who may be candidates for PCSK9i and IPE are on suboptimal therapy with statins and/or ezetimibe. If optimally managed on these agents, 6.1 and 10.2 million US adults over 40 years of age are expected to be candidates for PCSK9i and IPE, respectively.

Our findings underscore the degree to which standard lipid-lowering therapies are underused but also highlight the potential population that would benefit from PCSK9i and IPE in the United States. Prior studies have demonstrated the suboptimal use of standard lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and ezetimibe, in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Moreover, a recent study using the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) clinical registry demonstrated only modest lipid-lowering therapy intensification during a 2-year period in patients with ASCVD, with particularly low rates of intensification in non-White individuals.

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^114vDKLP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for patients after myocardial infarction (MI) rather than treating to a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, as the previous ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel third report) guidelines had advised.

- **Methods and results**: To evaluate the frequency of post-discharge lipid testing and high-intensity statin use among MI patients discharged on a statin during the ATP III guidelines era, we linked ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) Registry data to Medicare claims for 11,046 MI patients aged ≥ 65 years who were discharged alive on a statin from 347 hospitals (2007–2009). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association between lipid testing and 1-year high-intensity statin use. Only 21% of MI patients were discharged on a high-intensity statin. By 90 days after MI, 44% of patients discharged on a statin underwent lipid testing (43% on low- or moderate-intensity statins and 49% on high-intensity statins; P = 0.001). Follow-up lipid testing rates were 47% among patients with in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and 47% among newly prescribed statin recipients. By 1 year, only 14% of patients were on high-intensity statins. Only 4% of patients discharged on low- or moderate-dose statin were uptitrated to high intensity; post-discharge lipid testing was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of high-intensity statin use by 1 year (5.4% versus 2.9%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval).

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^116hypxj]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological therapies**: For patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the European guideline recommends adding nonstatin agents to high‐intensity maximal statin therapy in a sequential approach. First, ezetimibe is recommended, followed by PCSK9 inhibitors; both are class I recommendations if the LDL-C is above the target of > 55 mg/dL at each step. In contrast, the American guideline suggests adding ezetimibe (class I) to a high-intensity statin, although the sequential approach is not specified. The addition of PCSK9 inhibitors is considered reasonable, but not mandatory, if the LDL-C is above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (class IIa).

- **American perspectives**: In secondary prevention for patients at very high risk, the use of ezetimibe is recommended if LDL levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL on a maximally tolerated statin (class IIa). The addition of ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy is suggested as the first step in lowering LDL-C (class I), especially if combining with a PCSK9 inhibitor as a third agent is being considered. Ezetimibe is favored before PCSK9 inhibitors due to its availability as a generic, ease of administration (oral, once daily), and proven safety and tolerability with long-term data. Adherence to lifestyle changes and the effects of LDL-C-lowering medication should be assessed 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, and every 3 to 12 months thereafter for adherence and safety. If, after tolerated maximal LDL-C lowering therapy, LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL or non-HDL-C is ≥ 100 mg/dL, the addition of further treatment should be considered.

### Achieving optimal lipid goals in patients with coronary artery disease [^112JCcNb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy recommend intensive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering for patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have found that many high-risk patients are not achieving their LDL cholesterol goals, and many patients, despite being treated with lipid-lowering therapy, also have elevated triglycerides or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

To evaluate lipid goals in a "real world" clinical setting, the electronic medical records of 10,040 patients with coronary artery disease from a large cardiology subspecialty practice from September 2008 to September 2009 were reviewed. Overall, 79% of patients achieved an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl, while only 35% achieved the more aggressive goal of < 70 mg/dl. Non-HDL cholesterol goals of < 130 and < 100 mg/dl were achieved in 79% and 44% of patients, respectively. Additionally, only 69% achieved normal triglyceride levels, and only 63% of men and 56% of women achieved normal levels of HDL cholesterol. Women and younger men were less likely to achieve their lipid goals.

In conclusion, most patients with coronary artery disease achieve the minimal LDL cholesterol goal of 100 mg/dl, but few achieve the more aggressive goals of < 70 mg/dl. Many high-risk patients have elevated levels of triglycerides or low levels of HDL cholesterol despite treatment. Combination lipid-lowering therapy is used infrequently in practice. There exists a significant opportunity for physicians to more aggressively treat lipids to achieve the levels recommended by clinical guidelines.

### Comparative effects of lipid-lowering therapies [^117V12kk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutic drug classes have been developed to more precisely and intensively modulate lipid metabolism. Statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, and niacin exert their effects via different mechanisms, offering physicians the opportunity to beneficially impact multiple pathways in patients. When used alone or in combination, these drugs decrease the risk for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease.

There are strong clinical trial data to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention. This article:

- **Discusses the mechanisms of action**: of antilipidemic medications.
- **Reviews dosing regimens** and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class.
- **Assesses risk for drug interactions**: Ensures safe and effective use.
- **Reviews the clinical trial evidence**: Supporting the use of particular antilipidemic medications in specific physiologic settings.

The incidence of dyslipidemia is rising worldwide. This trend portends an ever-growing need for the aggressive and judicious use of different antilipidemic medications in patients at risk for all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

### A new statin: A new standard [^117DWGra]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatments designed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the setting of either primary or secondary prevention. The rationale for the aggressive lowering of LDL-C, supported by large observational studies, is the concept that no threshold exists below which reductions fail to provide additional benefit. Statins are widely considered first-line therapy for preventing CHD events because these agents yield the greatest reductions in LDL-C. However, many patients do not achieve target LDL-C levels with the currently available statins.

Newer, more effective statins may permit the benefits of aggressive LDL-C reduction to be extended to larger numbers of patients. A novel, highly efficacious statin, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca group of companies), is currently undergoing clinical investigation. Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients have shown that rosuvastatin produces significant, dose-dependent decreases in LDL-C compared with placebo. Reductions have ranged from 34% at a dose of 1 mg/day to 65% at 80 mg/day. This agent has been found to be well-tolerated across the range of doses studied.

Phase III studies indicate that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic patients and more effective than atorvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Overall, these findings suggest promising therapeutic potential for rosuvastatin in lipid management.

### New features of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III lipid-lowering guidelines [^113UoKbU]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk contain several distinguishing features from the previous ATP guidelines. These new features include modifications in lipid/lipoprotein levels considered optimal, abnormal, or reflective of risk; an increased focus on primary prevention through the use of Framingham risk scoring to define risk in persons with multiple lipid/nonlipid risk factors; and an increased focus on the association of the metabolic syndrome with CHD risk. The introduction of the category of CHD risk equivalents — including persons with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or a 10-year CHD risk > 20% based on Framingham scoring — results in an increase over previous guidelines in the proportion of patients categorized as being at high risk and therefore eligible for more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy.

Use of the new secondary therapeutic target of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should improve the management of lipid risk factors in patients who have elevated triglyceride levels after LDL-C goals have been met. These new features of the NCEP ATP III guidelines should enhance the identification and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias associated with CHD risk.

### A review of the current status of the management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [^1119bsBi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.

- **New risk levels**: For major lipid measures.
- **Emphasis on primary prevention**: Increased focus on preventing high cholesterol before it develops.
- **Inclusion of high-risk groups**: These groups are now considered in secondary prevention strategies.
- **Broader lifestyle program**: Extending lifestyle recommendations to improve cholesterol management.
- **Implementation and adherence**: Greater focus on ensuring guidelines are followed and maintained.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the major changes in ATP III and to highlight the benefits of the new guidelines in the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults.

### Lescol [^117D3Qek]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be used in conjunction with a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol. See National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines for further details.

Lescol® (fluvastatin sodium) and Lescol® XL (fluvastatin sodium) are indicated for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type IIa and IIb) to reduce elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, TG, and Apo B levels, and to increase HDL-C levels, when response to dietary restriction of saturated fats and cholesterol and other non-pharmacological measures has been insufficient.

Lescol and Lescol XL are recommended as adjunct therapy to diet for reducing Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B levels in adolescent boys and girls, aged 10–16 years, who are at least one year post-menarche. This is specifically advised for those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have not adequately responded to dietary restrictions and meet the following criteria:

- LDL-C remains > 190 mg/dL, or
- **LDL-C remains > 160 mg/dL and**:
	- There is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease, or
	- Two or more other cardiovascular disease risk factors are present.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should only be considered after excluding secondary causes for hyperlipidemia, such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other medications, or alcoholism. Prior to the initiation of fluvastatin sodium, a lipid profile should be performed to measure Total-C, HDL-C, and TG levels.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend considering adding a bile acid sequestrant for patients aged 20–75 years. This recommendation applies to those with a baseline LDL-C level of ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) who have achieved less than a 50% reduction in LDL-C levels, and have fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL (≤ 3.4 mmol/L) while on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy.

### Lowering LDL cholesterol in adults: A prospective, community-based practice initiative [^113Sj2zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of our study was to determine if a clinic-wide initiative with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) lowering interventions could be an effective health maintenance strategy. Patients with LDL levels greater than 100 mg/dL were placed on a lipid-lowering action plan and re-evaluated with a follow-up LDL (LDL(2)) in 3–4 months. An additional action plan was given to patients whose LDL(2) values were still above target, and their values were retested in another 3–4 months for a third LDL assessment (LDL(3)). The primary endpoints were pre-intervention LDL levels (LDL(1)) versus post-intervention LDL measurements (LDL(2) or LDL(3)). Secondary endpoints included total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels over the three measurement periods.

Of 514 patients who were given action plans, 443 returned for their follow-up lipid assessment. LDL levels in this group decreased from 140.7 ± 29.2 mg/dL (LDL(1)) to 110.9 ± 29.6 mg/dL (LDL(2); P < 0.05). Of these 443 patients, 167 individuals achieved LDL(2) levels that met the National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (< 100 mg/dL), and 87 were considered by their primary care providers as controlled (LDL 100–130 mg/dL). However, 158 individuals had LDL(2) levels that were either not controlled or not meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^113cjnqf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Many non-lipid-specific medications widely used in clinical practice have been associated with changes in the lipid profile.

- **Effects of polypharmacy**: These changes are noteworthy. To clarify, no studies have clearly demonstrated that raising the cholesterol content of HDL-C particles or lowering triglyceride levels translates to a reduction in ASCVD risk. Furthermore, clinical trials investigating the effects of lowering LDL-C levels have shown that a statistically significant reduction in ASCVD risk typically requires a threshold between-group difference in LDL-C levels, usually exceeding 25 mg/dL [0.65 mmol/L], within 3- to 5-year studies. Therefore, despite significant clinical effects of some medications on the lipid profile, little is known about the clinical relevance.

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies over 2 years in GOULD, a registry of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the US [^114t9QPL]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) recommend intensive statin therapy and the addition of nonstatin therapy if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are 70 mg/dL or more. Compliance with these guidelines is often low.

The objective of this study was to track LDL-C treatment patterns in the US over two years. GOULD is a prospective observational registry study involving multiple centers. Patients with ASCVD receiving any lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were eligible. Between December 2016 and July 2018, patients were enrolled in one of three cohorts: those currently receiving proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) and two groups not receiving PCSK9i drugs, with LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or more or LDL-C levels of 70 to 99 mg/dL. Patients underwent medical record reviews and telephone interviews every six months. Analysis was conducted on data collected as of October 5, 2020.

The primary outcome was the change in LLT use over two years. Secondary outcomes included the number of LDL-C measurements, LDL-C levels, and responses to structured physician and patient questionnaires over the same period.

A total of 5006 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 67.8 [9.9] years; 1985 women [39.7%]; 4312 White individuals [86.1%]). At two years, 885 patients (17.1%) had LLT intensification. Among the cohorts with LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or more and 70 to 99 mg/dL, LLT intensification occurred in 403 patients (22.4%) and 383 patients (14.4%), respectively. Statins were intensified in 115 patients (6.4%) and 168 patients (6.3%), respectively.

### Current perspectives on lipid lowering with statins to decrease risk of cardiovascular disease [^113nZoF9]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Although guidelines for individual risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) assist the healthcare provider, management of the global risk profile of patients is the optimal means to minimize risk. Regardless of whether patients have one or more risk factors, elevated lipid values are generally considered to be a major contributor to global CVD risk. Therefore, reduction of lipid levels is one of the most effective methods to reduce the risk of CVD. The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor class of drugs (also known as statins) has documented clinical benefits for reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, death from CVD, and total death. Despite widespread acknowledgment of the very favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of the statins, most at-risk patients either are not being treated or are not at the goals defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program.

### Application of new cholesterol guidelines to a population-based sample [^115F1cN3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) for the treatment of cholesterol expand the indications for statin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods**: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2005 to 2010, we estimated the number and summarized the risk-factor profile of persons for whom statin therapy would be recommended (i.e. eligible persons) under the new ACC-AHA guidelines, as compared with the guidelines of the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program. We extrapolated the results to a population of 115.4 million U.S. adults between the ages of 40 and 75 years.

- **Results**: As compared with the ATP-III guidelines, the new guidelines would increase the number of U.S. adults receiving or eligible for statin therapy from 43.2 million (37.5%) to 56.0 million (48.6%). Most of this increase in numbers (10.4 million of 12.8 million) would occur among adults without cardiovascular disease. Among adults between the ages of 60 and 75 years without cardiovascular disease who are not receiving statin therapy, the percentage who would be eligible for such therapy would increase from 30.4% to 87.4% among men and from 21.2% to 53.6% among women. This effect would be driven largely by an increased number of adults who would be classified solely on the basis of their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Those who would be newly eligible for statin therapy include more men than women and persons with a higher blood.

### Comparison of lipid profiles and attainment of lipid goals in patients < 65 years versus patients ≥ 65 years (from the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project [L-TAP] 2) [^116Ji3oJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

There is a well-established link between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events, although this risk is modified by age. Little is known about how the treatment of dyslipidemia and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment differ between older and younger patients. We obtained clinical data from 9,926 dyslipidemic patients across 9 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, and Asia from 2006 through 2007.

Multivariate regressions were performed to determine predictors of lipid level goal attainment. The study sample consisted of 5,733 adults < 65 and 4,193 adults ≥ 65 years old. Compared with younger patients, older patients were more likely to have diabetes (32.5% vs. 30.0%, p = 0.0014) and hypertension (73.4% vs. 57.0%, p < 0.0001), to be classified as high risk (68.6% vs. 53.2%, p < 0.0001), and to be taking a statin (79.1% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.0001). However, they were less likely to smoke (8.2% vs. 17.6%, p < 0.0001) or to have metabolic syndrome (29.0% vs. 34.4%, p < 0.0001).

Older patients had lower LDL cholesterol levels (95.1 vs. 103.9 mg/dl, p < 0.0001) and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54.2 vs. 51.5 mg/dl, p < 0.0001). LDL cholesterol goal attainment was 74.7% in older and 71.1% in younger patients (p = 0.036).

Older patients were more likely to achieve LDL targets whether low risk (89.8% vs. 84.6%, p = 0.002), moderate risk (79.0% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.0006), or high risk (70.5% vs. 64.4%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, older patients had different risk profiles and better lipid levels compared with their younger counterparts.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, specifically in relation to cardiovascular risk assessment, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining lipid profile screening in the following subgroups:

- **Individuals aged 50 years or older**:
	- Lipid profile screening is advised for this age group to assess cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Postmenopausal individuals**:
	- This group is encouraged to undergo screening due to the elevated risk of cardiovascular issues post-menopause.

- **Individuals with additional risk factors**:
	- Those who smoke cigarettes, have diabetes, or suffer from arterial hypertension should also be screened for lipid profiles.

### The impact of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines on drug development [^113SqBJS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

In the newest guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy, together with more attention to other lipid and lipoprotein parameters, is recommended for a larger group of dyslipidemic patients than was covered under ATP I and ATP II. A discussion to evaluate how future drug development might be affected by these new guidelines took place at the 14th International Symposium on Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism (DALM) conference, held in New York in September 2001.

These discussions involved how to develop new lipid-lowering drugs in an era where substantial evidence demonstrates the benefits of statins. Also covered were issues related to developing drugs with triglyceride indications and whether the proportion of patients achieving NCEP guidelines should be included in the label of lipid-lowering drugs.

Additional topics discussed included:

- **Possibility of incorporating a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) indication for lipid-lowering drugs**: The inclusion of such indications might broaden drug applicability to patients with specific lipid profiles.

- **Obtaining indications for lipid-lowering drugs specifically in patients with diabetes**: This reflects the growing recognition of the link between lipid levels and diabetes management.

- **Place of combination lipid-lowering drug therapy in drug development**: Reviewing whether combining different lipid-lowering agents can enhance therapeutic outcomes for patients.

- **Approval of drugs to increase levels of HDL-C in patients with isolated low HDL-C**: Exploring drug options that target specific cholesterol fractions to offer more tailored treatment strategies.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: A review [^1153MtUo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations - **American guidelines**: Both the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline on the management of blood cholesterol and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend obtaining a lipid profile after four weeks of admission for ACS. As LDL-C levels vary minimally after normal food intake, a nonfasting sample can be used.

- **Therapy overview**: An overview of American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy applied to patients with ACS is outlined below. Three agents with well-documented safety and efficacy can be prescribed (statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe). The appropriate timing of initiation and/or escalation of these agents depends on:
	1. whether patients are already on maximally tolerated doses of statin and/or ezetimibe
	2. the LDL-C level at the time of ACS.

- **LDL-C-lowering therapy**: The foundation of LDL‐C–lowering therapy is the prompt initiation of high‐intensity statin, followed by the addition of either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to hopefully blunt the short‐term re-ischemic complication rate. Guidelines advocate adding ezetimibe first as this is a more cost-effective strategy but also allow for initiation of PSCK9 inhibitors without ezetimibe. The rationale for considering initiation of a PSCK9 inhibitor without first starting ezetimibe is that only 3% and 5% of patients were on ezetimibe in the large phase 3 randomized FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects) study.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: A clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL), who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, achieving these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

### Association between change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality: Systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^116i9kih]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Lipid modifying effects**: The baseline concentrations and changes in lipid subfractions for the different classes of intervention are summarized. The average weighted mean baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration of all included participants was 140 mg/dl (SD 23; range 84–279) or 3.62 mmol/l, and the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration was 47 mg/dl (SD 7.4; 32–62) or 1.22 mmol/l. The weighted mean change in LDL-C was −23 mg/dl (SD 19) or −0.59 mmol/l, and the weighted mean change in HDL-C was 1.7 mg/dl (SD 3.1) or 0.04 mmol/l.

	- Almost all classes of intervention reduced LDL-C except for n-3 fatty acids and glitazones. HDL-C was raised by most classes of intervention except for n-3 fatty acids, low-fat diets, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, and probucol. In addition, high-dose statin treatment (defined as 80 mg daily simvastatin or atorvastatin) slightly reduced HDL-C compared with less intensive statin treatment (weighted mean change −0.23 mg/dl, SD 0.83), whereas statins overall raised it moderately (weighted mean change 1.6 mg/dl, SD 1.5).

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^117ERBSL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for patients after myocardial infarction rather than treating to a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, as the previous ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel third report) guidelines had advised.

- **Methods and results**: To evaluate the frequency of postdischarge lipid testing and high‐intensity statin use among patients discharged on a statin during the guidelines era, we linked ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) Registry data to Medicare claims for 11,046 patients aged ≥ 65 years who were discharged alive on a statin from 347 hospitals (2007–2009). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association between lipid testing and 1‐year high‐intensity statin use. Only 21% of patients were discharged on a high‐intensity statin. By 90 days after, 44% of patients discharged on a statin underwent lipid testing (43% on low‐ or moderate‐intensity statins and 49% on high‐intensity statins; P = 0.001). Follow-up lipid testing rates were 47% among patients with in-hospital low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and 47% among newly prescribed statin recipients. By 1 year, only 14% of patients were on high‐intensity statins. Only 4% of patients discharged on low‐ or moderate‐dose statin were uptitrated to high intensity. Postdischarge lipid testing was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of high‐intensity statin use by 1 year (5.4% versus 2.9%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.52–2.41).

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^116KCWdq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia/lipid management involves the following key points:

- **Screening**: In most adult patients, it is recommended to measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. For adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL), screening may be less frequent unless they possess multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

- **LDL cholesterol goals**:
	- In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L).
	- For individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) is an option, achievable through high-dose statin therapy.

- **Alternative therapeutic goals**: If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, an alternative goal is reducing LDL cholesterol by approximately 30–40% from baseline.

- **Triglyceride levels**: The target for triglycerides is < 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).

### Approach to lipoprotein management in 2001 National Cholesterol Guidelines [^115pQdAA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) released its Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III report. This was an evidence-based report that upgraded cholesterol management guidelines. The update was made possible by a series of large, cholesterol-lowering clinical trials. These trials demonstrated strongly the efficacy and safety of cholesterol reduction in both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD).

- **Major recommendations**: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol continued to be identified as the major target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. More emphasis was given to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides as important targets for management.

- **CHD risk equivalents**: The concept of CHD risk equivalents was introduced. A CHD risk equivalent represents an absolute risk for future CHD events equal to that in individuals with established CHD. Diabetes was identified as a CHD risk equivalent, requiring more intensive LDL-lowering therapy.

- **Metabolic syndrome**: The report placed more emphasis on the metabolic syndrome as a major, multiplex risk factor requiring increased clinical attention.

### Opportunity for intervention to achieve American Heart Association guidelines for optimal lipid levels in high-risk women in a managed care setting [^113GwZCt]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) recently established evidence-based recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in women, including lipid management. This study evaluated optimal lipid-level attainment and treatment patterns based on these guidelines in high-risk women in a managed care setting.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a historical prospective cohort analysis of a 1.1-million-member, integrated, managed-care database. Eligible high-risk women were those with evidence of previous CVD or risk equivalent, who had a full lipid panel available between October 1, 1999, and September 30, 2000; were naive to lipid therapy; and had a minimum of 12 months health plan eligibility preindex and postindex lipid panel. Optimal lipid levels were defined as LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) > 50 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL. Results indicated that 18% of women attained LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and 15% achieved non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL.

- **Conclusions**: Among high-risk women, few attained the AHA's standards for all lipid fractions, and only one third received recommended drug therapy, highlighting significant opportunities to apply evidence.

The 2020 DoD/VA guidelines highlight that for managing dyslipidemia and reducing cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to monitor adherence to treatment. They recommend considering intensified patient care strategies, such as phone calls, emails, patient education, and drug regimen simplification, to improve adherence to lipid-lowering medications.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular disease prevention: The search for superior treatment [^1122Zdrb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

US lipid-lowering guidelines indicate that optimal plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are < 100 mg/dL, and targeting global risk assessment has significantly increased the number of individuals who are candidates for intensive plasma lipid-lowering therapy. There is accumulating evidence that reduction of plasma LDL-C concentrations to targets even lower than those currently recommended may provide additional benefit in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention.

For example, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) found that statin treatment initiated at a baseline LDL-C plasma level of < 100 mg/dL in patients at high risk provided a relative benefit in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events, similar to when it was initiated at higher LDL-C plasma levels. In addition, it is becoming clear that CHD risk, and the need for intensive lipid-lowering treatment, may be underestimated in some populations, including individuals with metabolic syndrome.

In the overall primary prevention population, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurement has been shown to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events who would not be considered at high risk based on systems of risk assessment. The increasing focus on intensive plasma lipid lowering to reduce CHD risk has placed a premium on the development of therapies with improved ability to reduce plasma levels of LDL-C.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^1174J8Wb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is the most fundamental risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In clinical practice, many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient's lipid profile and, potentially, the risk for ASCVD — either favorably or unfavorably. The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, with unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, despite deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Several factors, most notably insulin resistance associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including: antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient's absolute risk.

### LYPQOZET [^116Ndc6C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of a multifactorial risk intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol, along with other non-pharmacologic measures, has been inadequate.

LYPQOZET, which contains a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

- **Reduce elevated lipids**: Reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

- **Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)**: Reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with HoFH, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments.

- **Limitations of use**: No incremental benefit of LYPQOZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LYPQOZET has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### Role of lipid and lipoprotein profiles in risk assessment and therapy [^115pKHZh]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the primary target for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention in the latest guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, many individuals who have CHD do not have substantially elevated LDL-C but have derangement of other lipid fractions, most commonly low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In the guidelines, HDL-C is important in risk stratification in primary prevention, influencing the need for and intensity of treatment of LDL-C. Both HDL-C and triglycerides are defined as risk factors for metabolic syndrome, a secondary target of therapy. Triglyceride levels also determine in which individuals non-HDL-C should be a secondary target of therapy.

Risk assessment that takes into account the entire lipid profile will identify more high-risk individuals than evaluating LDL-C alone. Some epidemiologic data suggest that instead of measuring the cholesterol in LDL or HDL, measuring their respective apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and apo A-I, may improve CHD risk assessment. In some observational and interventional studies, ratios of lipids and/or apolipoproteins have been better predictors of CHD risk than levels of any one lipid fraction. Trials of lipid-modifying therapy also suggest that apolipoproteins and ratios may provide improved targets for therapy beyond LDL-C, but optimal values have not been established. Because lipid-modifying therapy affects multiple components of the lipid profile, the effect on all lipid parameters should be considered when selecting a treatment approach.

### Dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dyslipidemia:

- **Definition**: Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, and/or increased triglycerides, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- **Primary causes**: Genetic abnormalities
	- **Secondary causes**:
		- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use
		- **Medical conditions**: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome
		- **Drug-induced factors**: Corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, an estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality, with 27% having elevated LDL cholesterol, 23% having decreased HDL cholesterol, and 30% having increased triglycerides.

- **Disease course**: Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

### Frequency of obtaining national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^117DkTZj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction; however, many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported.

Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006. These patients continued therapy for one year and had full lipid panels within six months before and nine to fifteen months after therapy initiation. Therapy, primarily statins, reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%.

HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged, with 49% and 50% being less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively, both in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups such as patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and a 10-year heart disease risk greater than 20%. After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities.

In conclusion, dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. Approximately half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117JUPp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, and lipid-lowering medications can reduce this risk. Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first-line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults has markedly changed the approach to lipid management. Statins are now identified as the preferred drug class to lower LDL-C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in four groups:

1. Those with known ASCVD
2. Those with an LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL
3. Those aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL
4. Those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10-year risk of ≥ 7.5%

The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age significantly, potentially increasing the number of adults eligible for statin therapy despite having well-controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

The intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit. A high-intensity statin lowers LDL-C by ≥ 50%.
