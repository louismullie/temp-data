## Question

work up for low WBC and RBC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for low WBC and RBC. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should classify the cytopenia pattern and integrate history and exam. Next, I will review the peripheral smear and reticulocyte count to distinguish hypoproliferation from loss or destruction. After that, I will pursue targeted labs based on MCV and suspected etiologies, consider bone marrow evaluation when indicated, and incorporate special populations and safety thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight red flags that mandate urgent action, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude spurious causes before labeling a patient as cytopenic. I should repeat the CBC with differential to verify persistence, check for nucleated RBCs that can falsely elevate the automated WBC and require manual correction, and review the smear for platelet clumping or other artifacts that can mislead automated counts, because these are common and avoidable pitfalls that can redirect the workup unnecessarily [^fd966ca3] [^3238e3a0].

> Next, I should classify the cytopenia pattern to frame the differential. Isolated low WBC suggests neutropenia or benign ethnic neutropenia, isolated low RBC indicates anemia, and combined low WBC and RBC raises concern for marrow failure or systemic disease. I need to ensure I also note platelets, because bicytopenia or pancytopenia changes the pretest probabilities and urgency of marrow evaluation, and I should remember that macrocytic anemia with low reticulocytes pushes me toward marrow failure or nutritional/medication causes rather than hemolysis or blood loss [^bf1babca] [^7e755de2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should integrate history and physical examination before ordering tests. I will ask about bleeding, diet, alcohol, medications including cytotoxics, antithyroids, antiepileptics, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, family history of cytopenias, infections such as HIV, hepatitis, EBV, parvovirus B19, and exposures to radiation or toxins, while on exam I will look for pallor, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, mucosal bleeding, and neurologic signs, because these clues often narrow the differential and prevent unnecessary testing [^0888661a] [^4642b228] [^d5d8b222].

> I will now examine the peripheral smear and reticulocyte count, since these are pivotal. The smear can reveal dysplasia, blasts, schistocytes, macrocytes, or hypochromia, and the reticulocyte count distinguishes hypoproliferation from blood loss or hemolysis. A low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count in anemia suggests marrow failure, nutritional deficiency, or chronic disease, whereas an elevated reticulocyte count points to hemolysis or acute blood loss, and I should double-check that I calculate the reticulocyte production index when needed to avoid misclassification [^eaffd491] [^440b00ef] [^14f6dc31].

> Let me think about MCV-based pathways next. For microcytosis, I should confirm iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation, consider iron studies in the context of inflammation, and add hemoglobin electrophoresis if indicated. For macrocytosis, I should check B12, RBC folate, and consider TSH, liver disease, and medications. For normocytic anemia, I should prioritize reticulocyte response, renal function, and inflammatory markers, and I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on a single cause because mixed etiologies are common, especially in older adults or those with chronic disease [^f4ad26bf] [^38764bc0] [^37f1cd81].

> But wait, what if the cytopenias are unexplained or the smear shows dysplasia or blasts? I should consider bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetics, and I must remember that in suspected acute leukemia, invasive procedures should ideally be deferred to the treating center to avoid duplication. I should also consider next-generation sequencing for myeloid genes when MDS or clonal cytopenia is suspected, and I need to check for benign ethnic neutropenia in patients of African ancestry with isolated neutropenia to avoid unnecessary marrow procedures [^9c302a11] [^0b367373] [^20c916ad].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In children, I need to consider nutritional iron deficiency, lead poisoning, hemoglobinopathies, and inherited marrow failure syndromes, and I should follow pediatric-specific guidance for severe aplastic anemia workups. In older adults, I must maintain a high suspicion for MDS, gastrointestinal blood loss, and clonal hematopoiesis. In patients with CKD, anemia is typically normocytic and hypoproliferative, and abnormal WBC or platelet counts should prompt evaluation for other processes. In patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, new cytopenias warrant evaluation for aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, or HLH/MAS with appropriate serologies and marrow studies [^225f092f] [^bf1babca] [^440b00ef] [^68653023].

> Next, I should review safety thresholds and when to transfuse or escalate. For stable adults, restrictive transfusion thresholds around hemoglobin 7 g/dL are supported, with higher targets in cardiac surgery or orthopedic patients, and I should individualize based on symptoms and comorbidities. For severe neutropenia, I need to ensure prompt infection precautions and consider growth factors in appropriate contexts. For suspected hemolysis, I should check LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin and avoid transfusing in TTP unless life-threatening. And I should remember that in suspected acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, early evaluation with CBC, reticulocyte count, and chest imaging is critical [^1225f45d] [^67a14840] [^6978fd49].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. First, confirm the abnormality and exclude artifacts. Second, classify the cytopenia and integrate history and exam. Third, review the smear and reticulocyte count to separate hypoproliferation from loss or destruction. Fourth, pursue MCV-guided testing for iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, renal, hepatic, and endocrine causes. Fifth, escalate to marrow evaluation when cytopenias are unexplained, progressive, severe, or accompanied by dysplasia or blasts. Sixth, incorporate special population considerations and safety thresholds. Throughout, I should double-check for medication-induced cytopenias and reversible contributors before labeling a patient as having a primary marrow disorder [^eaffd491] [^bf1babca] [^440b00ef].

> Finally, I should flag red flags that mandate urgent action. New pancytopenia, blasts on smear, severe anemia with hemodynamic instability, fever with neutropenia, suspected TTP or HLH/MAS, and suspected acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease all require expedited hematology involvement and targeted therapy. I need to ensure I do not delay appropriate transfusions, antibiotics, immunotherapy, or disease-specific interventions while waiting for confirmatory tests, because outcomes hinge on timely recognition and treatment in these scenarios [^ad2eafd3] [^68653023] [^6978fd49].

A low WBC and RBC workup should start with a **repeat CBC with differential and reticulocyte count** to confirm cytopenias and assess marrow response [^eaffd491] [^440b00ef]. Next, review the **peripheral smear** for dysplasia, blasts, or abnormal morphology [^eaffd491], and order iron studies, B12/folate, TSH, renal and liver function, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) to identify nutritional, endocrine, or chronic disease causes [^f4ad26bf] [^37f1cd81]. If cytopenias are unexplained or severe, proceed to **bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics** to evaluate for marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, or leukemia [^bf5ea6a5] [^ad2eafd3]. Add HIV, hepatitis B/C, and autoimmune testing as indicated, and consider next-generation sequencing for unexplained cytopenias or suspected clonal disorders [^0b367373] [^b5008184]. Management is guided by the underlying cause, with transfusion thresholds and hematology referral for persistent or severe cases [^1225f45d] [^bf1babca].

## Initial laboratory evaluation

### Confirmatory tests

- **Repeat CBC with differential**: Confirm persistent cytopenias and characterize WBC subsets [^eaffd491].
- **Reticulocyte count**: Assess marrow response; low suggests hypoproliferation, high suggests loss/hemolysis [^440b00ef].

---

### Peripheral smear

On peripheral smear, assess for **dysplasia** (macrocytosis, anisopoikilocytosis, pseudo-Pelger-Huet), **blasts** (suggests leukemia), and **morphology** (schistocytes, spherocytes, elliptocytes) [^eaffd491].

---

### Basic laboratory screening

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron to assess deficiency or anemia of chronic disease [^f4ad26bf].
- **Vitamin B12 and folate**: Evaluate macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia [^38764bc0].
- **TSH**: Rule out hypothyroidism-related anemia [^fc3019e4].
- **Renal and liver function tests**: Identify organ failure or chronic disease contributing to anemia [^7e755de2].
- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR/CRP to assess chronic inflammation or autoimmune disease [^0afb84eb].

---

## Indications for bone marrow examination

Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics are indicated when:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Unexplained cytopenias persisting ≥ 3 months | Identify marrow failure, MDS, or leukemia [^bf1babca] |
| Dysplasia on smear or macrocytosis | Suspect MDS or myeloid neoplasm [^7e755de2] |
| Suspected aplastic anemia or pure red cell aplasia | Confirm diagnosis and guide therapy [^507a72df] |
| Abnormal blasts or leukoerythroblastic picture | Evaluate for leukemia or marrow infiltration [^ad2eafd3] |

---

## Additional specialized tests

- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, anti-dsDNA, rheumatoid factor for suspected autoimmune cytopenias.
- **Infectious disease testing**: HIV, hepatitis B/C, EBV, parvovirus B19 as indicated [^7e755de2].
- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, direct antiglobulin test if hemolysis suspected [^14f6dc31].
- **Next-generation sequencing**: For unexplained cytopenias or suspected clonal hematopoiesis/CCUS [^0b367373] [^b5008184].

---

## Clinical decision-making and management

- **Transfusion thresholds**: Generally Hb < 7 g/dL in stable adults; individualize by comorbidity and symptoms [^1225f45d].
- **Hematology referral**: Persistent unexplained cytopenias, suspected marrow failure, or blasts on smear [^bf1babca].
- **Targeted therapy**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. iron/B12 replacement, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, HSCT) [^3683a610].

---

A structured approach — confirm cytopenias, assess marrow response, screen for common causes, and escalate to marrow evaluation when indicated — ensures efficient diagnosis and management of low WBC and RBC counts.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^67a14840]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^fd966ca3]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^eaffd491]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CAP/ASH acute leukemia initial diagnostic workup — Statement 3 specifies the pathologist should review recent or concurrent complete blood counts (CBCs) and leukocyte differentials and evaluate a peripheral blood smear (PBS), which aid in the diagnosis of AL and are necessary for predicting prognosis; the panel believes there is little to no undesirable effects, and this standard of care does not require additional resources.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^7218171e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale.

A variety of laboratory investigations may aid in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Some markers may predict disease severity and progression to ARDS, thromboembolic complications, or multi-organ failure. The U.S. NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines suggest performing the following laboratory tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease: a complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver and renal function tests. It also advises measuring the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer, and ferritin for their prognostic values, though not part of the standard care. The WHO interim guidelines on the management of COVID-19 disease (May 27, 2020, September 11, 2020) however do not provide guidance on specific laboratory testing in COVID-19 patients. This section attempts to address this discrepancy with a focus on resource-constrained LMIC settings.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of September 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", and "laboratory findings" or "laboratory abnormalities". Few of the studies originated from LMICs. The search identified two useful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search, did not identify any randomized clinical studies.

Evidence.

Hematology.

Lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and low hemoglobin predict progression toward severe COVID-19. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts are higher, and lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin are lower in patients who die. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was one of the independent predictive factors for critical illness at hospital admission. Eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe and non-severe COVID-19. Blood cell counts may be a useful diagnostic aid in patients with a suggestive history and imaging for COVID-19 but who test negative by RT-PCR. –

### Clinical approach to marrow failure [^0b4b465e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment and medical management of aplastic anemia fundamentally differ between patients with inherited versus acquired marrow failure; however, the diagnosis of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome is frequently obscure. Recent exciting advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have resulted in a profusion of new tests to aid in diagnosis. This in turn has raised questions regarding the appropriate choice of testing for the patient presenting with aplastic anemia. Important clues to the diagnosis of an inherited marrow failure syndrome may be gleaned from careful attention to the clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory workup.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, IBD, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain standard anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) in patients with low hemoglobin levels. Include serum vitamin B12 measurement in a more extensive workup.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^5945ef78]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

CAP/ASH acute leukemia initial diagnostic workup — Statement 1 directs that the treating clinician should provide relevant clinical data or ensure that this is readily accessible by the pathologist, including the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, hematologic history, prior malignancy, exposures to cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or other possibly toxic substances, additional diagnostic or prognostic clinical findings, and history of confounding factors such as recent growth factor therapy, transfusions, or other medications that might obscure or mimic acute leukemia; clinicians should also provide family history of any hematologic disorder or other malignancies. The panel notes that while collecting this information may take time, the benefits grossly outweigh any risks or harms.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease with acute chest pain — patients with sickle cell disease who are experiencing chest pain require prompt evaluation, and in those with suspected acute chest syndrome (ACS), emergency transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended and ACS should be excluded. In patients with sickle cell disease who experience chest pain, ACS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates; these patients should be transferred to an acute care setting by EMS when there is clinical suspicion of ACS. The recommended diagnostic evaluation for adults with a presentation concerning for acute chest syndrome includes an ECG, troponin test, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, reticulocyte count, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph, and blood and sputum cultures.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^30e94988]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

Of 909 patients, 85% (773/909) were female, with a mean age of 57 years of age. Of all patients, 64% (579/909) were prescribed antibiotics, although only 28% of patients exhibited symptoms consistent with UTI and only 40% and 41% of patients had positive bacteria on urinalysis or positive urine cultures, respectively (Figure 1). Only 34% of prescribed antibiotics were first‐line (Appendix SC). Of all patients, 22% were seen in an ER setting, while the remaining 78% of patients presented to outpatient medical offices. A small subset of patients (3%) had chronic UTI symptoms, while 25% had acute UTI symptoms. Patients who presented to the ER had higher levels of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), urinary squamous cells, and bacteria seen on urinalysis than patients who presented to office‐based clinical settings (Table 1).

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^7928286e]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^9c302a11]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia — referral and deferring invasive procedures: If after examination of a peripheral blood smear, it is determined that the patient will require immediate referral to another institution with expertise in the management of acute leukemia for treatment, the initial institution should, whenever possible, defer invasive procedures including bone marrow aspiration and biopsies to the treatment center to avoid duplicate procedures, associated patient discomfort, and additional costs. The panel does not suggest that care be delayed or prohibited; however, the panel strongly believes that patients will benefit from having the treating center take the primary role in performing invasive procedures.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

### The impact of initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings on outcome among patients with NCI standard (SR) and high-risk (HR) B-lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): a report from the children's oncology group (COG) studies AALL0331 and AALL0232… [^7b424f76]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract 10016 Background: To determine the prognostic significance of variable numbers of white cells, blasts and/or red cells in diagnostic CSF samples of ALL patients, COG protocols, AALL0331 /AALL0232 incorporated a uniform CSF and risk group classification schema for all newly diagnosed patients. CSF status was designated as: CNS1-no blasts; CNS2a- < 5 WBC + blasts + < 10 RBC/ml; CNS2b- < 5 WBC + blasts + > 10 RBC/ml; CNS2c- > 5 WBC + blasts, with excess WBC. proportional to RBC; CNS3a- > 5 WBC + blasts + < 10 RBC/ml; CNS3b
- > 5 WBC + blasts + > 10 RBC/ml, with excess WBC not proportional to RBC; CNS3c- clinical signs of CNS leukemia. Only CNS1 patients could be allocated to the SR-low risk arm. CNS2 status did not impact therapy but CNS3 patients received augmented therapy and 1800 cGY cranial radiation. Results: In multivariate analysis that includes age and WBC at diagnosis and Day 29 MRD < 0.

1%, the presence of CSF blasts, regardless of the number of CSF WBC or RBC is an independent adverse predictor of outcome for NCI SR and HR patients. The EFS difference reflects a significant difference in the incidence of CNS, not marrow relapse in CNS1vs CNS2/3 patients. Conclusion: Even low levels of CNS leukemia, regardless of the number of RBCs, are associated with a lower EFS/OS and an increase in the likelihood of CNS relapse. The use of dexamethasone in NCI SR patients did not negate the impact of CSF blasts. Further augmentation of CNS directed therapy is needed for patients with CNS2/3 disease.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^3238e3a0]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

DIAGNOSIS AND RISK STRATIFICATION OF AML

Diagnostic Workup of AML

Although AML may be discovered accidentally during routine blood tests, the majority of cases present with the signs and symptoms of one or more forms of cytopenia, including symptomatic anemia, bleeding, or infection. The physical examination may reveal bruises or bleeding because of thrombocytopenia. Extramedullary disease can be observed in some patients, including CNS involvement. Whenever indicated, imaging such as positron emission tomography can be used to evaluate potential extramedullary disease. However, a biopsy from the suspected site is essential to confirm the disease, as multiple factors could result in a false-positive positron emission tomography scan reading, such as infections and the use of growth factor agents. Any neurologic signs or symptoms should be evaluated through a diagnostic lumbar puncture, once the blasts are reduced in the peripheral blood, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Lumbar puncture can also be considered for patients presented with monocytic differentiation or high white blood cell count.

The complete blood count with 5-part differential counts red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; measures hemoglobin; estimates the red cells' volume and sorts the WBCs into subtypes. A CBC is a routine blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection, and leukemia. Mobile Examination Centers Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. The data were reviewed.

Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. Five derived variables were created in this data file. The variables were created using the following formulas: LBDLYMNO = LBXWBCSI LBXLYPCT/100. LBDMONO = LBXWBCSI LBXMOPCT/100 LBDNENO = LBXWBCSI LBXNEPCT /100 LBDEONO = LBXWBCSI LBXEOPCT/100. The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable ending in "LC" indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other varible prefixed LBX ie. LBXHGB) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection, an imputed value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^1225f45d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^440b00ef]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### The clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected hypocellular marrow failure [^507a72df]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The overlap in clinical presentation and bone marrow features of acquired and inherited causes of hypocellular marrow failure poses a significant diagnostic challenge in real case scenarios, particularly in nonsevere disease. The distinction between acquired aplastic anemia (aAA), hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes presenting with marrow hypocellularity is critical to inform appropriate care. Here, we review the workup of hypocellular marrow failure in adolescents through adults. Given the limitations of relying on clinical stigmata or family history to identify patients with inherited etiologies, we outline a diagnostic approach incorporating comprehensive genetic testing in patients with hypocellular marrow failure that does not require immediate therapy and thus allows time to complete the evaluation. We also review the clinical utility of marrow array to detect acquired 6p copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity to support a diagnosis of aAA, the complexities of telomere length testing in patients with aAA, short telomere syndromes, and other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, as well as the limitations of somatic mutation testing for mutations in myeloid malignancy genes for discriminating between the various diagnostic possibilities.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a98993b7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for question

Hematologic abnormalities (i.e. leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or pancytopenia) are manifestations of sarcoidosis that raise the possibility of bone marrow involvement, although this is not the most common cause of such abnormalities. Splenomegaly with sequestration may be a more common cause of hematologic abnormalities. In the absence of splenomegaly, compartmentalization of white blood cells to the site of organ involvement is a common cause of leukopenia and lymphopenia (,–). Additional causes of hematologic abnormalities are hepatic sarcoidosis, nonsarcoidosis medical problems, and treatment with immunosuppressive therapies, like methotrexate. Less-frequent hematologic abnormalities attributed to sarcoidosis include eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia may be a presenting manifestation of sarcoidosis, but the cytopenia more often presents as a secondary finding in those with active disease. As a result, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis should undergo a baseline complete blood cell count testing to screen for hematological abnormalities.

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^3d748fae]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^bf5ea6a5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Childhood myelodysplastic syndromes — differential diagnosis and diagnostic thresholds are noted: Differential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular volume and clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory, and higher expression of p53, lower expression of survivin, or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA. Compared with AML, low WBC count, multi-lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis with numerical rather than structural cytogenetic abnormalities suggest MDS, and a bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, with biologic features more important than a strict blast cutoff value. Monosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, dysplasia does not necessarily indicate antecedent MDS and criteria for MDS diagnosis in a patient who presents with AML are stringent; dysplasia may reflect infection, deficiencies of B12 and copper, drug therapy, or chronic disease, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and Pearson syndrome should also be excluded.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### The time has come for next-generation sequencing in routine diagnostic workup in hematology [^0b367373]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica, Vantyghem et al. demonstrate, in a real-life setting, how the application of a customized next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel can support routine diagnostics, deliver prognostic information, and may even directly influence the choice of therapy towards a more personalized treatment.

The diagnostic workup for patients with unexplained cytopenia or proliferative blood counts currently follows specific clinical procedures: After a deep dive into the patient's history and an examination of his or her complete blood count, a peripheral blood smear is evaluated microscopically. At the same time, several medical imaging techniques, such as ultrasound or computed tomography scans, are used to determine the plausible cause of the observed signs and symptoms. If a malignant hematologic disorder is suspected, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are often the next steps. The material obtained is then analyzed morphologically, cytogenetically, and histologically. However, even combining the results of the various investigations (cytomorphology, cytochemistry, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, histology, immunohistology, and multiparameter flow cytometry) does not guarantee a precise diagnosis in all cases, e.g. a malignant hematologic disorder or reactive/normal/benign conditions. For patients without a firm diagnosis, the treatment options dwindle down to 'watch-and-wait' often accompanied by the application of more diagnostic techniques (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography), and "reevaluation in 3 months if blood counts remain abnormal".

### Prevalence and predictability of low-yield inpatient laboratory diagnostic tests [^ed1571bd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Implications

This study provides a general approach to identifying predictable laboratory tests. Many of the laboratory tests that we evaluated have been evaluated for overuse, including magnesium level, blood cultures, and complete blood cell counts. Patient-specific estimates of laboratory test result normality at the point-of-order entry may discourage low-yield tests with predictably negative results and encourage appropriate tests with high levels of uncertainty. For example, when our method did not predict a blood culture result to be negative, this corresponds to greater than 16% positive predictive value (Table). This finding is more than enough risk of bacteremia to prompt diagnostic testing and even empirical treatment.

This approach can also raise questions on how guideline- and protocol-based testing is implemented and could be optimized. The optimal threshold of acceptable uncertainty depends on the clinical scenario and the particular test. For example, although screening tests (eg, HIV testing or pregnancy screens in hospital settings) have predictable normal results, most of the time, they are unlikely to be influenced by decision support when the effect of missing an abnormal case is sufficiently severe and driven by overriding protocols. Similarly, regulatory requirements around sepsis protocols are a major driver of repeated lactate testing that may not be amenable to decision support on predictable results. The results of this study can still inform the development of such regulatory requirements on the appropriate number and interval of screening tests that may otherwise be excessive or too rigid for individual cases. In predictable cases, the risk of false-positive test results (and adverse downstream effects) may be substantial.

These results can also provide foundational quantitative support for cost-effectiveness analysis. For example, if scaling the annual volume of predictable tests (predicted normal results) by their financial costs (eTable 10 in the Supplement), one could estimate annual savings by avoiding these tests. However, this saving should be carefully compared against potential harms and costs generated from missing the actually abnormal tests (false-negative results). In cases of panel test ordering, practitioners are often only interested in 1 or 2 components of panel tests at a time (eg, sodium level from a metabolic panel or hemoglobin level from a complete blood cell count). Most panel components may be predictably normal, but there could still be value in the overall order if there is sufficient uncertainty in at least 1 other clinically relevant component. Our separate predictions for each panel component in Figure 3 would allow practitioners to decide which components are relevant for their decision-making in future point-of-care information displays.

Hematologic adverse events

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Although rare, hematologic irAEs have been described following ICI treatment and the literature includes case reports of hemolytic anemia, red cell aplasia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia and hemophilia A. An active hematologic irAE also needs to be distinguished from transient changes in laboratory values that can occur during initiation of an immune response. Post treatment lymphcytosis, eosinophilia, neutrophilia and monocytosis can be observed and are not typically clinically significant though some reports suggest they may be prognostic. Persistent post treatment cytopenias or progressive cytopenias should be evaluated for autoimmune causes as well as with a peripheral smear, reticulocyte count and assessment for hemolysis. Causal attribution is complicated by the fact that malignant disease and its complications can also lead to cytopenias. Since the CTCAE definition of thrombocytopenia describes absolute platelet levels rather than an indication of changes in cell number, it is not a reliable tool for evaluating potentially life-threatening ICI-induced thrombocytopenia.

Diagnostic evaluation

Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored at the start of immune therapy, at intervals during treatment, and periodically in long-term survivors who are no longer receiving treatment. Development of anemia should prompt evaluation for common causes such as GI bleeding, cancer-related anemia or cancer progression, or causative drugs, including a work up for hemolysis. If the source of anemia cannot be identified, bone marrow biopsy may be indicated to rule out red cell aplasia. Similarly, any patient who develops thrombocytopenia or neutropenia should be evaluated for potential causes including medication-related cell destruction or disease progression; in cases where an obvious cause cannot be identified, an autoimmune cause should be considered and investigated accordingly.

When to refer

In general, patients with unexplained cytopenias should be referred to hematology for evaluation.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in tuberculosis combined with other bacterial infections [^7524c430]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a common infectious disease of the lungs caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb infected one-third of the population in 2021, producing disease in approximately 10% and killing 1.6 million people. Co-infections involving tuberculosis(TB) and bacterial pathogens have been reported, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of TB. There is a significant increase in susceptibility to PTB and the risk of death among individuals aged 65 and over. Elderly patients with PTB have poor physique, low immunity, and chronic consumption of PTB, so they are more likely to be complicated by pulmonary bacterial infection. Distinguishing between TB and co-infections involving bacterial pathogens presents a significant clinical challenge. Failure to differentiate these conditions may result in poorer health outcomes, including increased healthcare costs, antimicrobial resistance, and higher mortality rates. Clinical observations indicate that PTB is often complicated with pulmonary bacterial infections, but they are difficult to identify using conventional diagnostic methods. This is especially true for patients with bacterial-negative PTB, which presents diagnostic challenges due to atypical imaging findings and prominent fever, along with abnormal laboratory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer(DD), and white blood cell count(WBC). Currently, diagnosis is primarily based on empirical anti-infective treatment or a combination of anti-tuberculosis and anti-infective therapies, followed by assessment of lesion absorption through chest X-ray and computed tomography scans. This approach may result in irrational use of drugs use and delayed patient recovery. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for TB. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) have been identified as emerging biomarkers for evaluating the severity of inflammation. Given that these ratios are easily and rapidly measured, a growing number of studies have focused on these indicators. Significant alterations in NLR, FAR, and RDW have been well-documented in various common acute and chronic diseases, including neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases. These biomarkers have garnered attention as potential diagnostic indicators capable of aiding in risk assessment and clinical decision-making. However, fewer studies have systematically examined the value of NLR, FAR, and RDW in the differential diagnosis of TB with concurrent bacterial infection. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the diagnostic value of NLR, FAR, and RDW in patients with TB and concurrent bacterial infection, and to provide a more accurate and reliable foundation for the differential diagnosis and individualized treatment of these patients.

### How I diagnose low-grade myelodysplastic syndromes [^8a7b117a]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of myeloid neoplasms that are often difficult to diagnose due to their pathologic and clinical heterogeneity. The key features of MDS are peripheral blood cytopenias, ineffective hematopoiesis manifesting as morphologic dysplasia, and clonal genetic abnormalities. The most difficult diagnostic dilemmas often arise in low-grade MDS cases (lacking excess blasts), which can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of cytopenia. This distinction requires the integration of information from the peripheral blood (both CBC parameters and morphology), bone marrow morphology, genetic studies, and interrogation of the clinical record to exclude secondary causes.

Methods

We discuss the approach to the diagnosis of low-grade MDS (cases lacking increased blasts), including a diagnostic algorithm and two illustrative cases.

Results

The appropriate use of ancillary studies is important to support or dispute the likelihood of low-grade MDS in conjunction with the findings of morphologic dysplasia. Interpreting the results of cytogenetics and next-generation sequencing can be challenging and must incorporate the emerging knowledge of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

Conclusions

The role of pathologists in integrating data from multiple sources in the diagnosis of low-grade MDS is evolving and becoming increasingly complex; in this challenging diagnostic setting, it is important to feel comfortable with uncertainty and maintain a conservative approach.

### Interventions to reduce repetitive ordering of low-value inpatient laboratory tests: a systematic review [^bd97e894]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

One in every five inpatient laboratory tests ordered is unnecessary as it does not contribute to the advancement of patient care. This high volume of repetitive lab testing is among the 4–5 billion tests that are performed within the USA each year, with approximately 200 billion dollars in annual healthcare spending attributed to excessive testing and treatment. Moreover, unnecessary blood draws contribute to hospital-acquired anaemia, patient discomfort and excess downstream testing. Drivers of inappropriate testing include defensive medicine and panel-based ordering.

To help address and promote high value care, the Choosing Wisely Campaign recommended in 2013 against performing complete blood count (CBC) or basic chemistry tests 'in the face of clinical stability'. Though many groups have attempted to follow this recommendation, there are limited synthesis and analysis of effective methods. One narrative review of 17 interventions suggests reduction in laboratory testing is best achieved through simultaneous interventions. Our analysis builds on this review by seeking to categorise and identify the most highly effective interventions.

We performed a multidatabase systematic review to identify current methods for reducing unnecessary daily labs in the inpatient setting and their effectiveness. This work can guide future interventions to reduce overall laboratory testing. This review focuses on interventions and outcomes specifically aimed at reducing the high volume of daily labs that do not contribute to the advancement of patient care.

Nonmicrobiologic testing and endoscopy in infectious diarrhea — Serologic tests are not recommended to establish an etiology of infectious diarrhea or enteric fever (strong, low), but may be considered for people with postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in which a stool culture did not yield a Shiga toxin–producing organism (weak, low). A peripheral white blood cell count and differential and serologic assays should not be performed to establish an etiology of diarrhea (strong, low), but may be useful clinically (weak, low). Frequent monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet counts, electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine is recommended to detect hematologic and renal function abnormalities that are early manifestations of HUS and precede renal injury for people with diagnosed Escherichia coli O157 or another Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, especially STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 or are associated with bloody diarrhea (strong, high); examining a peripheral blood smear for the presence of red blood cell fragments is necessary when HUS is suspected (strong, high). Endoscopy or proctoscopic examination should be considered in people with persistent, unexplained diarrhea who have AIDS, in people with certain underlying medical conditions as well as people with acute diarrhea with clinical colitis or proctitis and in people with persistent diarrhea who engage in anal intercourse (strong, low); duodenal aspirate may be considered in select people for diagnosis of suspected Giardia, Strongyloides, Cystoisospora, or microsporidia infection (weak, low). Imaging such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be considered to detect aortitis, mycotic aneurysms, signs and symptoms of peritonitis, intra-abdominal free air, toxic megacolon, or extravascular foci of infection in older people with invasive Salmonella enterica or Yersinia infections if there is sustained fever or bacteremia despite adequate antimicrobial therapy or if the patient has underlying atherosclerosis or has recent-onset chest, back, or abdominal pain (weak, low).

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^38764bc0]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — vitamin B12 and folate testing notes these are uncommon but treatable causes of anemia linked to macrocytosis and low red blood cell (RBC) indices, with limited data indicating the prevalence is ≤ 10% of hemodialysis patients and unknown in CKD. Because these deficiencies are easily correctable and vitamin B12 deficiency may signal other disease processes, assessment of folate and vitamin B12 levels are generally considered standard components of anemia evaluation, especially with macrocytosis. Folate deficiency is best detected with serum folate testing, and RBC folate can be measured when serum levels are equivocal or recent dietary intake may obscure deficiency using serum levels alone.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^c749749d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Complete blood count (CBC) indices and their ratios, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), are widely reported to have significant associations with adverse clinical outcomes in many acutely ill cohorts –. These markers have been studied in diverse clinical settings for their potential to inform diagnosis and prognosis –, assist with triage, and guide treatment decisions. The pathophysiologic mechanisms generating these associations in diverse disease settings are not fully understood, and this mechanistic uncertainty may contribute to reduced clinical utilization of these markers. Recent work has identified co-regulation of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) populations as a feature of healthy inflammatory recoverythat is preserved across heterogeneous pathologic processes including different types of trauma, ischemia, and infection. Favorable inflammatory recoveries are defined by exponential WBC decrease followed by linear PLT increase. This finding provides a potential unifying mechanism for CBC ratio associations with mortality across the diversity of acute inflammatory disease settings.

If a universal WBC-PLT inflammatory recovery trajectory helps generate the widely observed associations between CBC index ratios and clinical outcomes, then a ratio specifically designed with this trajectory in mind, PLT/WBC (PWR), should reliably increase during successful inflammatory recoveries and be at least as strongly associated with clinical outcomes as other ratios that do not as directly reflect these WBC-PLT recovery dynamics. Thus, we hypothesized that PWR would provide significant risk stratification in inflammatory settings by reducing the WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, or persistent WBC elevation, or both. However, PWR has not been studied systematically in contrast to NLR, PLR, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and other CBC-derived statistics.

Here, we show that PWR provides stronger stratification of mortality risk than other CBC markers and ratios in the setting of four different diseases involving acute inflammation: COVID-19, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We validate these findings in a cohort from an independent medical center. Our results are consistent with recently identified inflammatory dynamicsand suggest that PWR may provide a convenient and interpretable summary of patient inflammatory state.

Systemic lupus erythematosus — diagnosis of kidney involvement (urine abnormalities) indicates testing at systemic lupus erythematosus presentation or suspicion of flare with a testing panel of serum creatinine, urinalysis (dipstick and sediment), spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR), and serology (anti-dsDNA and complement). Evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment is defined as dipstick protein ≥ 2+ (any level of specific gravity), dipstick protein 1+ (low specific gravity), or spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol), with or without urine sediment positive for dysmorphic red blood cells (≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts. If there is no such evidence, the pathway states "No further urine testing at this time"; if present, it directs to "Quantify proteinuria" and asks "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?", with "Consider kidney biopsy" for the positive branch and "Repeat testing and follow the progress" for the negative branch.

Under "Is there evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment", abnormal proteinuria is defined by dipstick protein " ≥ 2+ (any level of specific gravity)", dipstick protein "1+ (low specific gravity)", or "spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol)", and sediment criteria include dysmorphic red blood cells "(≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts"; if present, clinicians should "Quantify proteinuria" and assess "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?" with "Yes" leading to "Consider kidney biopsy" and "No" to "Repeat testing and follow the progress" and "No further urine testing". In parallel, for "Is there evidence of decreased or decreasing GFR", examples include "abnormal eGFR that is below the expected level based on age and clinical history, or decreasing eGFR, with no attributable cause other than systemic lupus erythematosus", with "Yes" directing to "Consider kidney biopsy" and "No" to "No further kidney function testing", with repeat testing; figure caption states "eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate".

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Rational management approach to pure red cell aplasia [^715aec4a]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patient populations

Based on uniformly defined criteria (Online Supplementary Table S1), 62 cases of PRCA, confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and treated at the Cleveland Clinic between the years 2000 and 2016, were included in the retrospective analysis (Online Supplementary Table S2 and Online Supplementary Figure S1). Informed consent was obtained per protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical parameters of the patients, including demographics, blood counts, treatment specifics, and survival times, were obtained from medical records. The primary end-point was a hematological response in terms of an appropriate rise in reticulocytes/hemoglobin and becoming transfusion-independent, as determined by two separate measurements after the first eight weeks of initiating the treatment. This is the earliest time for assessment of response. By contrast, borrowed from more systematic studies in aplastic anemia and systemic immunosuppression, response was again assessed at the 3-month milestone, and in less common circumstances monitored for six months until defining it as a non-responder to a particular treatment. Normal blood counts were determined using hospital standards.

### How I manage patients with unexplained cytopenia [^b5008184]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The term "unexplained cytopenia" is used to describe a condition characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia that cannot be attributed to identifiable causes using conventional tests or to any concomitant diseases. Unexplained cytopenia requires clinical attention and further investigation to identify individuals at risk of developing a hematologic neoplasm. The available evidence suggests that somatic mutation analysis may effectively complement the diagnostic workup and clinical management of unexplained cytopenia. Indeed, the presence or absence of somatic mutation(s) in myeloid genes shows high positive and negative predictive values for myeloid neoplasms (MNs). Mutation analysis is also crucial for identifying patients with clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS), a condition at increased risk of developing a MN. Recently, clinical/molecular prognostic models have been developed, providing valuable tools for the personalization of clinical and molecular surveillance. Most patients with CCUS show mild cytopenia and do not require therapeutic intervention. Currently, there is no treatment approved for CCUS, and transfusion therapy is the sole therapeutic option for patients with severe symptomatic cytopenia. However, this field has been emerging as a domain of active clinical investigation. This article presents 4 case studies of patients with unexplained cytopenia, which hematologists may encounter in their clinical practice.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^345909e7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The complete blood count is a cornerstone of modern clinical evaluationand has been shown in many studies to have surprising and unexplained associations with adverse outcomes particularly in acute inflammatory states –, but this prognostic information is often unfamiliar to physicians and represents unrealized clinical value. Based on analysis of patient cohorts at three different clinical sites, this study identifies PWR as a convenient summary of patient inflammatory state in rapidly changing acute care settings.

Infection, ischemia, and trauma all trigger inflammatory responses that mobilize WBC and consume PLT with feedback to WBC and PLT proliferation rates. Healthy individuals mount an effective response, and their WBC and PLT populations tend to recover along a universal WBC-PLT trajectory. PWR provides a single marker encapsulation of these dynamics, reducing this WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with abnormally low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, persistent WBC elevation, or both. Low PWR may reflect dysregulation between PLT and WBC populations analogous to the way elevated RDW can reflect perturbations to red cell homeostasis and provide prognostic information on short-term risk –. The consistency of these changes across heterogeneous acute inflammatory settingssuggests that PWR may succinctly quantify key aspects of inflammatory regulation and recovery, and that PWR changes may occur as part of, or in tandem with a normal inflammatory response and recovery. Other non-inflammatory processes that alter WBC or PLT will also influence PWR and may limit its prognostic utility in inflammatory states. The consistency of PWR's stronger association with short-term mortality compared to other CBC-derived markers in 4 heterogenous study cohorts across two medical centers and in a general surgical cohort from a third independent medical center supports the prior finding of universal WBC-PLT dynamics during recovery from acute inflammatory stimuli. This mechanistic explanation, for the associated prognostic signal may facilitate clinical utilization.

### Levetiracetam oral (levetiracetam) [^d5d8b222]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

Minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 x 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients in controlled trials.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 x 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 x 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^7e755de2]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — CNS status classification and traumatic lumbar puncture (LP) rule — CNS‑1 is defined as no lymphoblasts in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regardless of white blood cell (WBC) count, CNS‑2 as WBC < 5/mcL in CSF with presence of lymphoblasts, and CNS‑3 as WBC ≥ 5/mcL in CSF with presence of lymphoblasts. If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, the LP is traumatic, and WBC ≥ 5/mcL in CSF with blasts, compare the CSF WBC/red blood cell (RBC) ratio to the blood WBC/RBC ratio; if the CSF ratio is at least two‑fold greater than the blood ratio the classification is CNS‑3, otherwise it is CNS‑2. Flow cytometry may be considered, and patients who have CNS‑1 disease with leukemia detected only by flow cytometry may be at higher risk but evidence is limited to retrospective analyses.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^b708b417]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Audit setting and population

A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients younger than 50 years who visited the ED of a large tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada for 6 months between December 2015 and May 2016 with an ED diagnosis of renal colic. Patients who received a discharge diagnosis of renal colic during this period were identified through use of ED information system (EDIS). Using electronic medical records (EMRs), patients from this group were identified whose management did not comply with this CW recommendation. These patients were under the age of 50 years, had a history of renal colic, presented with uncomplicated renal colic and received a CT scan. Uncomplicated renal colic was defined based on presentation to the ED: (1) temperature < 37.8°C on presentation, (2) absence of refractory vomiting requiring > 3 doses of Ondansetron, (3) absence of refractory pain requiring > 15 mg of morphine equivalents, (4) absence of a history of underlying urological or nephrological problems and (5) absence of significant renal impairment evidenced by serum creatinine < 120 µmol/L. All patients meeting these criteria were considered to have uncomplicated renal colic and were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study group if they received CT imaging to rule out other conditions in addition to renal colic (eg, rule out renal colic and appendicitis).

CT was available 24 hours, but US was available from 07:00 to 16:00 each day. For ultrasound ordered after 16:00, patients were either instructed to return the following day to receive their scan or kept in the ED until the morning.

Audit data collection

For each patient, their demographic data, relevant prior medical history, clinical presentation, lab values, ED medications administered, diagnostic imaging ordered (including time of order entry, indications and findings) and dispositions were recorded. All data were abstracted from the EMRs of patients. Laboratory results collected included serum creatinine and serum white blood cell count, as well as urinalysis for red blood cells and white blood cells. Key clinical features assessed included presence of flank pain, gross haematuria, nausea and vomiting, and signs of infection.

5.8 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

Minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 x 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients in controlled trials.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 x 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 x 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Hemaphagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome

Hemaphagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) is a hematological disorder involving inappropriate macrophage activation, with a high potential for lethality. The diagnostic criteria include cytopenias, hyperferritinemia (commonly in thousands of ng/mL), fever, splenomegaly, coagulopathy, LFT abnormalities, and elevation of soluble IL-2 receptor. Examination of bone marrow aspirate by a pathologist can also be important to identify potential HLH.HLH occurs at a median of 26 days, and is more common in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs than anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs. The management of HLH/MAS is complex and not 'one size fits all', potentially encompassing cytotoxic chemotherapies such as etoposide, cytokine modulation with agents such as anti-IL-6, and/or corticosteroids, depending on the etiology and patient characteristics.

Aplastic anemia

Aplastic anemia (AA) is often a result of immune-related bone marrow failure, and manifests as pancytopenia. AA has a low rate of resolution and is frequently difficult to treat. ATG has been attempted as a salvage therapy in a patient who developed lethal AA after dual PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition for metastatic melanoma that did not improve after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), tranexamic acid, and repeated platelet transfusions, but data are lacking on optimal management and options are limited.

Pure red cell aplasia

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) can be associated with either anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs but occurs rarely. PRCA symptoms present at a median of 89 days following the start of ICI treatment.

Neutropenia

ICI-related neutropenia typically occurs at a median of 10.5 weeks after the initiation of ICI therapy. As with any form of neutropenia, ICI-related neutropenia carries an increased risk of infectious complications.

Hematological toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any hematological-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^70d65387]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

Laboratory workup — monitoring indicates that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) value indicates inflammation but the specificity of this test for monitoring MRONJ is low; literature reports higher CRP levels correlate with severity of acute inflammation and larger osteolysis size; uncontrolled diabetes is associated with delayed wound healing and, therefore, in diabetic MRONJ patients, HbA1C level should be checked over time; reduction in white blood cell count (WBC) was reported to be associated with recurrence of MRONJ, so WBC should be monitored and if values are low, patients should be followed closely; MRONJ-related sepsis is a rare complication that is an emergency requiring monitoring and management according to the standard workup for sepsis.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) related anemia — evaluation and initial workup: Standard assessments should be performed to look for other causes of anemia, including GI bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and corrected if depleted, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproliferative macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels. Bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Marked elevation of cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count: an unusual case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, differential diagnosis, and a brief review of current epidemiology and treatment recommendations [^2df9e50e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is rarely a difficult diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Unfortunately for the practicing clinician, patients are rarely that straightforward. Patients who are elderly, very young, or immuno-compromised often present with subtle findings, making the correct diagnosis a challenge. In addition, patients being treated with antibiotics may be misleading in their clinical presentation, leading to a missed diagnosis of meningitis. Only when one considers the diagnosis or obtains a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is the correct diagnosis made. Although the clinical scenario may suggest meningitis, it is the cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count that establishes the definitive diagnosis. Despite the advent of systemic antibiotics over 50 years ago, bacterial meningitis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The following case report details a woman diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with an extremely high cerebrospinal white blood cell count. Although this is typically thought to be caused by abscesses or malignancy, meningitis alone may cause such an elevation. In addition, a brief review of the current epidemiology and treatment regimens for meningitis is discussed.

### Is bone marrow examination always necessary to establish the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes? A proposed non-invasive diagnostic model [^991a5ebb]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

A non-invasive myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) diagnostic model would allow for care while avoiding invasive bone marrow examinations (BME). BME-established MDS patients were compared to non-MDS (BME-excluded) patients. Variables (gender, age, hemoglobin (Hb), mean red blood cell corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet (PLT), and white blood cell (WBC)) were combined with multivariate logistic regression; a probability score (Y) was calculated. MDS (n = 48) and non-MDS (n = 63) patients were used to establish the model. The ROC was drawn, giving an AUC of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656–0.84). Two cutoff values were used for Y. Y ≥ 0.633: high likelihood (positive predictive value (PPV) = 85%); Y ≤ 0.288: low likelihood (negative predictive value (NPV) = 81%) of MDS. The first group is defined as probable MDS (pMDS); the second, probably not MDS (pnMDS). The model was validated with 40 additional patients (20 with and 20 without MDS). Using clinical and lab data, we could diagnose or exclude MDS in about half of the patients, avoiding BME. Future work will use larger cohorts of patients to improve and further validate the model.

### Association of a benign genotype and unnecessary bone marrow biopsies in African American patients… [^20c916ad]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that genotyping for rs2814778-CC may avoid unnecessary bone marrow biopsies related to isolated low WBC counts among African American patients. Importance Up to two-thirds of African American individuals carry the benign rs2814778-CC genotype that lowers total white blood cell count. The observation of lower mean white blood cell counts among individuals of African ancestry compared with those of European ancestry is well established. 1–4 The clinical finding of low WBC counts among healthy individuals of African ancestry is variably designated benign ethnic neutropenia and is not associated with an increased risk of infection. 5–7 This phenomenon is attributed, in large part, to homozygosity for the rs2814778-C variant in the promoter of ACKR1 gene.

Because reference ranges of normal values for WBC counts do not account for genotype, persons with the rs2814778-CC genotype are more likely to have a WBC count that falls below the reference range. Although many practitioners are aware of benign ethnic neutropenia, genotyping for the rs2814778-C variant is not routine, and the extent to which this genetic diagnosis is clinically recognized is unknown. Accurate clinical interpretation of a low WBC count is only possible by knowing the individual's genotype. As the US population becomes increasingly admixed, 18, 22 reliance on self-identified race will become increasingly inaccurate. Another potential solution is additional education for practitioners. The study data indicate that hematologists continue to include BMB in the workup of isolated low WBC counts in some African American patients. In current clinical practice, WBC variation attributable to this genotype is not easily distinguished from WBC variation attributable to disease.

An alternative approach supported by this study is to define genotype-guided reference ranges. Among African American participants in in this study, 69% had the rs2814778-CC genotype, previously associated with lower WBC counts. This genotype was more frequent among those who underwent a BMB for an isolated low WBC count than among those who underwent a biopsy for another indication; most biopsies for an isolated low WBC count identified no hematologic abnormality. Accounting for the rs2814778-CC genotype in clinical decision-making may avoid unnecessary BMBs, which would be particularly beneficial for African American individuals, in whom the risk genotype is common.

### Unexplained chronic cytopenia: is it idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance or myelodysplastic syndrome [^2f132874]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic cytopenia is a condition where there is a decrease in peripheral blood counts causing either anaemia, leucopoenia and thrombocytopaenia. Most cases of cytopenia reveal a cause on further workup. But very rarely, in some cases, a definitive cause could not be identified. Unexplained cytopenia becomes challenging and poses difficulty in diagnosis and management. Discriminating these groups of bone marrow failure disorders from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) becomes an important clinical question. We describe a case of a middle-aged Hispanic woman who presented with pancytopenia and on extensive workup did not reveal any specific cause. Her bone marrow examination revealed severely reduced megakaryocytes but with normal haemopoiesis of other lineages. Cytogenetics, flow cytometry, comprehensive next-generation whole genomic analysis did not reveal any abnormalities. She fit the criteria for idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance rather than MDS. She remained asymptomatic and her counts never improved with immunosuppressives or thrombopoietin mimetics.
