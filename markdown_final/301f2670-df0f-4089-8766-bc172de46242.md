## Question

What do you need to do for a baby with an right aortic arch

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what needs to be done for a baby with a right aortic arch. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and defining the anatomic variant. Then, I should assess associated congenital heart disease and genetic risk. Next, I will evaluate for a vascular ring and symptom triggers. After that, I need to decide on imaging strategy and thresholds for intervention. Finally, I will outline conservative management, surgical indications, and long-term follow-up, while integrating shared decision-making and center-specific resources into the plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the anatomy, because management hinges on whether this is an isolated right aortic arch with mirror-image branching versus a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and left ductus, which creates a vascular ring, or even a double aortic arch variant that can be misclassified on fetal echo. I should double-check the branching pattern and the presence of a left ductus or diverticulum of Kommerell, as these determine ring physiology and symptom risk [^112iSNrH] [^111uFYpJ] [^115KqQQC].

> Wait, let me verify the association with congenital heart disease, because right aortic arch with mirror-image branching is strongly linked to conotruncal defects such as tetralogy of Fallot and truncus arteriosus, and I need to ensure a meticulous postnatal echocardiogram to exclude intracardiac lesions that would change the management pathway entirely [^113wmBmP] [^112CUXeh] [^1115HvTu].

> I should confirm genetic risk next, since isolated right aortic arch still carries a nontrivial risk of 22q11.2 deletion, and prenatal counseling should include offering microarray or FISH for 22q11.2 as well as a detailed fetal survey for extracardiac anomalies. Hold on, I should verify that the risk is higher when intracardiac anomalies are present, which supports a lower threshold for invasive testing in those cases [^1134y7bw] [^114nyNXM] [^112d9QmX].

> Now, I will examine the possibility of a vascular ring, because a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and left ductus forms a complete ring that can compress the trachea and esophagus. I need to check for noisy breathing, stridor, recurrent respiratory infections, feeding difficulty, choking, or dysphagia, and I should remember that symptoms often emerge with growth or introduction of solids, so early infancy may be deceptively quiet [^115KqQQC] [^115zsZq3] [^116yqQob].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immediate surgery. I should review a symptom-based, collaborative cardiopulmonary pathway that avoids empiric cross-sectional imaging in all infants, reserving CT or MRI for those with progressive or severe aerodigestive symptoms, and using shared decision-making to balance the risks of anesthesia, radiation, and intervention against the likelihood of spontaneous improvement, especially in rural settings where access to surgical centers is limited [^112x4mnZ] [^113romFe] [^115zsZq3].

> Let me consider the imaging strategy carefully. Transthoracic echocardiography confirms arch sidedness and branching but can miss a double aortic arch with atretic segment or a Kommerell diverticulum, so if symptoms progress or anatomy remains unclear, I should obtain a contrast-enhanced CT angiography or cardiac MRI to define the ring and quantify tracheoesophageal compression, while minimizing radiation when possible in infants [^115KqQQC] [^1115HvTu] [^1163Frab].

> I need to ensure I am not over-calling bronchoscopy. Although some centers advocate screening bronchoscopy, the degree of tracheal compression on bronchoscopy does not reliably correlate with symptom severity, so I should reserve bronchoscopy for cases where direct airway assessment will change management or when alternative diagnoses like adenotonsillar hypertrophy or tracheomalacia are suspected [^1146DzH8] [^116yqQob].

> Next, I should review conservative management for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infants. Anticipatory guidance on feeding progression, sleep positioning, and activity is reasonable, with scheduled follow-up every 3 to 6 months to monitor growth, development, and evolving symptoms, and I should double-check that most prenatally diagnosed isolated right aortic arch infants remain asymptomatic or improve without surgery in the first 2 years, which supports a watchful waiting approach when clinically safe [^112x4mnZ] [^112Nsfn6] [^113QZerL].

> But wait, what if symptoms are progressive or severe? I should confirm surgical indications such as failure to thrive from feeding difficulty, recurrent aspiration or pneumonia, significant stridor or respiratory distress, or documented severe tracheal or esophageal compression on imaging, and I should remember that combining digestive symptoms with noisy breathing increases the likelihood that symptoms are ring-related and may warrant earlier surgical evaluation [^115zsZq3] [^116yqQob] [^115z6R1R].

> I will now examine the operative approach. For a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian and left ductus, division of the ligamentum arteriosum and resection or translocation of a Kommerell diverticulum when present relieves the ring, whereas a double aortic arch typically requires division of the non-dominant arch, and I should verify that outcomes are excellent with low mortality but nontrivial risks such as chylothorax, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and persistent tracheomalacia requiring ongoing airway support [^115KqQQC] [^116SFPx9] [^112T62gs].

> Let me reconsider timing. Fetal diagnosis enables earlier, elective intervention before chronic airway injury, and contemporary series show earlier surgery in prenatally diagnosed vascular rings without increased postoperative morbidity, but I should balance this against the fact that many infants improve spontaneously, so timing should be individualized to symptom trajectory and anatomy rather than age alone [^112T62gs] [^115zsZq3] [^113romFe].

> Next, I should review long-term follow-up. Even after successful ring division, some children have persistent respiratory symptoms from tracheomalacia, so I need to ensure ongoing surveillance for growth, feeding, and airway issues, and I should also remember that right aortic arch may be associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm in a subset, prompting consideration of cross-sectional aortic imaging in older children or adults with concerning features or family history, guided by multidisciplinary aortic team input [^116SFPx9] [^111hGdR1] [^111NxLWn].

> I should double-check that my plan aligns with imaging appropriateness criteria and pediatric congenital heart disease follow-up standards, using echocardiography as first-line and escalating to CT or MRI when anatomy is incomplete or symptoms progress, and coordinating care through a multidisciplinary team that includes pediatric cardiology, pulmonology, otolaryngology, and pediatric surgery to optimize outcomes and minimize unnecessary testing and interventions [^115UXYJ3] [^111NxLWn].

> In summary, I need to ensure a staged, symptom-driven approach: confirm the right aortic arch variant and exclude associated congenital heart disease, assess for vascular ring physiology and evolving symptoms, avoid empiric cross-sectional imaging in asymptomatic infants, manage conservatively with close follow-up when safe, and proceed to surgical ring division for progressive or severe aerodigestive compromise, all while integrating genetic counseling and long-term surveillance for residual airway disease and rare aortic complications [^115zsZq3] [^112x4mnZ] [^115KqQQC].

For a baby with a right aortic arch, **confirm the diagnosis with postnatal echocardiography** and assess for a vascular ring or associated anomalies [^112x4mnZ] [^114HBGhG]. If asymptomatic, **observe with routine growth and development monitoring**; if symptomatic (stridor, wheezing, feeding difficulty, or recurrent infections), obtain CT/MRI and refer for surgical repair [^115KqQQC] [^112x4mnZ]. Most isolated right aortic arches are managed conservatively, but a complete vascular ring requires surgery to relieve tracheoesophageal compression [^116SFPx9] [^113QZerL].

---

## Clinical significance and associated anomalies

- **Incidence and associations**: Right aortic arch occurs in about 0.1% of the population and is often associated with other congenital heart defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and ventricular septal defects [^113wmBmP] [^112CUXeh].

- **Vascular rings**: A right aortic arch can form a vascular ring when combined with an aberrant left subclavian artery and a left ligamentum arteriosum, causing tracheal and esophageal compression [^115KqQQC] [^113KTiYK].

- **Genetic considerations**: Right aortic arch is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, particularly 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) [^112d9QmX] [^1134y7bw].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Prenatal diagnosis

During prenatal diagnosis, **fetal echocardiography** using the three-vessel trachea view (3VTV) can identify a right aortic arch and associated anomalies [^112iSNrH] [^116CBJWL]. Genetic testing should be considered, especially when other anomalies are suspected, to evaluate for **22q11.2 deletion syndrome** [^112d9QmX] [^1134y7bw].

---

### Postnatal diagnosis

- **Echocardiography**: Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography confirms the diagnosis and evaluates associated cardiac anomalies [^114HBGhG].

- **CT/MRI**: Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) is essential to define the vascular anatomy, assess tracheal and esophageal compression, and plan surgical intervention if needed [^115KqQQC] [^1115HvTu].

- **Bronchoscopy**: May be performed to assess the degree of tracheal compression and guide management decisions [^1146DzH8].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary with the **presence of a vascular ring** and the degree of tracheoesophageal compression:

| **Symptom** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory symptoms | Stridor, wheezing, recurrent respiratory infections, and difficulty breathing, especially during feeding or crying [^111tceso] [^116SFPx9] |
| Feeding difficulties | Dysphagia, choking, and recurrent emesis due to esophageal compression [^116oGHHo] [^116yqQob] |
| Growth impairment | Failure to thrive due to chronic respiratory distress and feeding difficulties [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management consists of **regular follow-up** with periodic clinical assessments, growth monitoring, and echocardiographic evaluations for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infants [^112x4mnZ]. Supportive care includes nutritional support, respiratory management, and antibiotics for recurrent infections [^notfound].

---

### Surgical intervention

- **Indications**: Surgical intervention is indicated for symptomatic infants with significant tracheoesophageal compression, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, or failure to thrive [^112Nsfn6] [^114HBGhG] [^112DA2Nu].

- **Surgical techniques**: The most common procedure is division of the vascular ring (ligamentum arteriosum) to relieve compression. Alternative approaches include aortic translocation or reconstruction, depending on the specific anatomy [^112DA2Nu] [^112a8fzR].

- **Outcomes**: Surgical intervention typically results in significant improvement or resolution of symptoms, with low morbidity and mortality rates [^116SFPx9] [^112DA2Nu].

---

## Long-term follow-up and prognosis

Long-term follow-up focuses on **regular monitoring** of growth and development, respiratory function, and cardiovascular health [^112x4mnZ] [^115UXYJ3]. Prognosis is **generally favorable**, especially for isolated right aortic arch without significant associated anomalies. Persistent symptoms may occur if tracheomalacia or other airway abnormalities are present [^116SFPx9] [^114nyNXM].

---

## Parental counseling and education

Parental counseling should explain the diagnosis, associated anomalies, and **potential complications** to set expectations [^113KQkip]. Families should be educated to recognize **respiratory distress**, feeding difficulties, and **signs of infection**, and to seek prompt medical attention. Ongoing support should address anxiety and stress associated with the diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies [^113fJmcq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Postnatal echocardiography and CT/MRI imaging to define vascular anatomy and assess compression [^112x4mnZ] [^115KqQQC].

- **Conservative management**: Regular follow-up, growth monitoring, and supportive care for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infants [^115zsZq3] [^112x4mnZ].

- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for symptomatic infants with significant tracheoesophageal compression or failure to thrive [^114HBGhG] [^116yqQob].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Regular monitoring of growth, respiratory function, and cardiovascular health [^112x4mnZ].

- **Parental counseling**: Education and support to manage anxiety and stress associated with the diagnosis [^113fJmcq].

---

Management of a baby with a right aortic arch involves confirming the diagnosis, assessing for associated anomalies, and implementing a symptom-based approach. Conservative management is appropriate for asymptomatic infants, while **surgical intervention is indicated for symptomatic cases** with significant tracheoesophageal compression. Long-term follow-up and parental counseling are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Prenatal diagnosis and outcome of right aortic arch without significant intracardiac anomaly [^114HBGhG]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Right aortic arch (RAA) is usually associated with the presence of a significant congenital heart disease, usually a conotruncal defect, which determines the postnatal outcome. In the absence of such cardiac defects, the significance of RAA has not been determined. The aims of this study were to evaluate the significance of recognizing RAA in fetuses with normal or near normal intracardiac anatomy and to determine which associations may be present.

Methods

A retrospective study was completed of all fetuses diagnosed with RAA with normal or near normal intracardiac anatomy between 1999 and 2011. The aim was to evaluate the presence of RAA with complete ultrasonic evaluation using two-dimensional imaging complemented by the Doppler color flow technique, paying particular attention to the three-vessel and tracheal view. We compared the prenatal findings with the postnatal outcomes and management of this cohort of fetuses.

Results

Among 16,450 fetal echocardiograms, 58 fetuses (0.35%) were diagnosed with RAA with normal or near normal intracardiac anatomy. Gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 19 to 34 weeks (mean, 23 weeks). Isolated RAAs were found in 50 fetuses, and double aortic arches (DAAs) were recognized in eight other cases. The postnatal cohort consisted of 44 newborns with RAAs and eight with DAAs (two were lost to follow-up, and four pregnancies were terminated). Postnatal echocardiography confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of RAA in 41 of 45 children, and four were found to have DAAs. Three of seven fetuses diagnosed prenatally as having DAAs were found to have only RAAs. Fourteen fetuses underwent karyotyping; two had 22q11 deletion and two had 47xxy. Eleven infants (21%) had respiratory symptoms, eight with DAAs, one with RAA, mirror-image head and neck vessels, and two with RAAs and aberrant left subclavian arteries. Surgery was indicated in all symptomatic patients except one, whose symptoms resolved. One asymptomatic patient underwent operation for significant compression of the trachea.

Conclusions

RAA on fetal ultrasonography may indicate vascular and chromosomal abnormalities that may complicate postnatal management. When RAA is identified, fetal karyotype analysis (including the integrity of chromosome 22) is warranted. RAA may herald an occult DAA and may be a clue to a tight vascular ring. Hence, it seems essential to conduct a careful postnatal evaluation of fetuses with RAAs on prenatal ultrasound.

1238. The normal anatomy of the central mediastinal great artery system derives from several complex steps of embryonic differentiation, subsequent involutions, and remaining patencies of primary vascular arches. 1 Abnormal embryological differentiation of the aortic arch and central pulmonary arterial system may lead to complex pathologic relationships between these vessels and the tracheobronchial tree. Because of the considerable topographic variability of their origin and course in the mediastinum, some of these vascular malpositions can cause significant compression of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, or esophagus. 2 These malformations are rare, accounting for 1. 0% to

1. 6% of. all congenital cardiac anomalies.

2 The disarranged patterns of the great arteries all share a common form of a complete ring or a sling with subsequent tracheal compression. 2 Approximately 20% of children with symptomatic vascular rings have other associated congenital heart anomalies. 3 The anomalies that most often cause airway compression are a double aortic arch or a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery and a left ligamentum arteriosum. 4 Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Persistent fifth arch anomalies-broadening the spectrum to include a variation of double aortic arch vascular ring [^117K3gdA]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Fifth arch anomalies are rare and complex and frequently misdiagnosed or mistaken for other entities. We report a double arch vascular ring that is thought to consist of right fourth arch and left fifth arch components, a previously undescribed persistent fifth arch variant. The currently recognized spectrum and classification of fifth arch vascular anomalies are expanded along with illustrative images to justify the proposed changes. Reviewing and expanding the classification of fifth arch anomalies to include a double arch ring variant will promote recognition, correct diagnosis and appropriate management of these anomalies.

### The significance of a prenatal diagnosis of right aortic arch [^116MRgXJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To analyze a population of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed right aortic arch (RAA).

Methods

Retrospective study of fetuses with RAA diagnosed prenatally between 2011 and 2015 in two referral centers.

Results

Right aortic arch was found in 4.4% (46/1036) of fetuses with cardiovascular abnormalities (CVA). As an isolated anomaly, RAA was present in 30.4% of cases; in 32.6%, other CVA were detected; in 23.9%, CVA and extracardiac anomalies; and in 13.1%, only extracardiac malformations. The most common noncardiac abnormalities were thymus hypoplasia/aplasia (7/17), of which six had deletion 22q.11.2. In another three fetuses, trisomy 21 was present. One intrauterine fetal death occurred at 41weeks of pregnancy, and two fetuses died after birth. In six of 18 infants with known follow-up, symptoms of dysphagia were reported, of which four infants underwent surgical intervention. In 12 infants, an isolated RAA was clinically silent.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of RAA is an indication for a detailed examination of cardiac and noncardiac structures, including the thymus. It is advisable to consider genetic testing, together with the assessment of deletion 22q11.2, especially in the case of accompanying defects. The prognosis depends on underlying cardiac and extracardiac anomalies and possibly coexisting genetic defects. Isolated anomalies are asymptomatic. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^115LB7cT]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Limitations

Our study was subject to retrospective review limitations with occasionally incomplete or missing data, primarily as families either moved out of the catchment area or did not return to care. Although our median age at last subspecialty follow‐up for medically managed patients was 14 months, which was less than our anticipated observational period of 18 months, presumably these children did not return to follow‐up because they were asymptomatic. For patients who did not return for subspecialty care, their emergency department and primary care visits were systematically assessed for evidence of possible progressive symptoms due to a vascular ring. Although no indicators (surgical records, additional aerodigestive clinical imaging) were found, it is possible that these patients were referred externally for additional management.

While our study included a ten‐year review of a large geographic catchment area, it was not designed as a randomized prospective clinical trial and ultimately yielded a small overall sample size both in medical and surgical groups, which precluded more detailed subgroup analyses. Although there was no clear difference in clinical patterns between children with aberrant left subclavian artery and those with mirror image branching, our study was not powered to detect this anatomic variation as a predictor variable. Our approach limiting the use of cross section imaging may have resulted in underdiagnosis of a double aortic arch, as was present for one patient with a diminutive left aortic arch in addition to the right aortic arch, and should prompt clinicians to consider the expected limitations of fetal and transthoracic echocardiography in this context. Our study did not assess the perceptions of healthcare clinicians or patients regarding the collaborative care pathway. Lastly, while our study offers insights for postnatal iRAA management, it may not be applicable to all anatomic variants, particularly those resulting in more severe initial presentation or at older ages.

### A double aortic arch mimicking a right aortic arch with an aberrant subclavian artery [^113sYToU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 4-month-old boy was referred for persistent respiratory symptoms despite having undergone division of the ligamentum arteriosus for the diagnosis of a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery. A computed tomography scan demonstrated symmetric arch vessels around the trachea at the thoracic inlet, with the left common carotid artery being tethered posteriorly, more suggestive of a double aortic arch with an atretic left arch between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. This diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively, and division of the atretic portion released the bronchial obstruction. This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of the vascular anatomy.

Aortic coarctation and interrupted aortic arch — table considerations and scope: This table includes clinical scenarios related to aortic coarctation and interrupted aortic arch before and after operative repair, angioplasty, or aortic stent placement, and does not include evaluation in infants with suspected coarctation and a patent ductus arteriosus. Imaging for bicuspid aortic valve is referenced in Table 11 (LVOT Lesions). In postprocedural evaluation, concerns may include residual or recurrent aortic obstruction, aortic aneurysm, in-stent stenosis, stent fracture, and endoleak, and in asymptomatic patients age is considered because it impacts the frequency of imaging surveillance and the modalities under consideration.

### Management of coarctation and aortic arch anomalies in the adult [^1128vf4s]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital Aortic arch malformations are rare in adults. Often they present with hypertension or tracheoesophageal compression. The involved anatomy is dependent on the sidedness of the aortic arch and the variable development of the primitive pharyngeal arches. Sternotomy and thoracotomy are usually required for surgical repair, while need for circulatory arrest is not uncommon. With caution and adequate planning, surgery can be carried out with satisfactory results.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^115z6R1R]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Although prenatal imaging advancements have increased isolated right aortic arch (iRAA) detection, optimal postnatal vascular ring management remains uncertain. Whereas early postnatal imaging and surgical management may be clinically warranted for some infants, long‐term data are not yet available to justify an identical approach for all prenatal iRAA diagnoses.

Methods

Children with prenatally diagnosed iRAA and left ductus arteriosus were included in a retrospective cohort study at a rural academic center. Fetal echocardiograms (2014–2024) were reviewed to exclude complex congenital heart disease. Joint postnatal cardiopulmonary care was standardized. Clinical data were ascertained using aerodigestive symptom checklists. Fisher's exact test was used to examine associations between symptoms and surgical referral. Growth was assessed by z‐score rates of change from birth weight until last clinic weight.

Results

3,458 fetal echocardiograms were performed yielding 31 distinct cases meeting inclusion criteria, with postnatal data available for 25. Twenty were managed medically (25% asymptomatic, 75% intermittently symptomatic) with median follow up of 14 (11.5, 17.5) months; five underwent surgery (80% progressively symptomatic) with median follow up of 36 (18, 37) months). Choking/dysphagia (p = 0.04), recurrent emesis (p = 0.03), and the combination of both digestive symptoms and noisy breathing (p = 0.01) were associated with surgical referral. Weight outcomes were similar (p = 0.98) between medical and surgical patients.

Conclusions

Although aerodigestive symptoms were common, most were not progressive and weight profiles were not adversely affected. Isolated digestive symptoms or in combination with respiratory symptoms may prompt greater concern. A collaborative cardiopulmonary approach to clinical evaluation may help with short‐term risk stratification.

### Occlusive aortic arch thrombus in a preterm neonate [^113s13nt]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the case of an extremely preterm infant with occlusive aortic arch clot managed with low-risk therapy.

Data Source

Case details were obtained from medical records and echocardiographic images from Excelera database.

Study Selection

Preterm infant with occlusive clot in the aortic arch.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Demographic details (gestation age and birthweight), clinical and biochemical data (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, urine output, lactate levels, and coagulation profile) were obtained from medical records. A female infant was born at 28 wks gestation and had umbilical catheters inserted in satisfactory positions. On day 6, pre- and postductal oxygen saturation differences, a significantly higher blood pressure on right arm, and weak pulses were noted. Echocardiogram revealed an occlusive thrombus in the aortic arch distal to the innominate artery, extending into the carotid artery with retrograde flow in the left internal carotid and subclavian arteries. The distal aortic circulation was supported by ductus arteriosus shunting bidirectionally. Intravenous prostaglandin E and heparin were started, the latter was later replaced by enoxaparin. Serial echocardiograms over next 3 mos showed complete resolution of the thrombus.

Conclusions

Neonatal aortic arch thrombus is extremely rare with only 3 cases previously reported — all in term infants. Therapeutic options include anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy, and thrombectomy. The risk/benefit ratio for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy is unknown and must be individualized. This preterm infant was managed with low-risk therapy and had an optimal outcome.

Clinical management algorithms for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic children with iRAA are often center specific, and may empirically recommend more sophisticated imaging, bronchoscopy, and surgery. Prior studies have described that the degree of tracheal compression identified during bronchoscopy does not always correlate with symptom severity and therefore recommend screening bronchoscopy for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Other studies have suggested a risk of impeded tracheal development due to compression from a vascular ring, contributing to recommendations for a lower threshold for invasive testing and surgical intervention. Additionally, the potential long‐term risk of unrepaired iRAA on esophageal motility, neurocognitive development, surgical technique challenges, and quality of life are not well known. Our study contributes important medical data by describing short‐term postnatal outcomes utilizing a clinical algorithm that de‐emphasizes empiric testing, which may be more generalizable for nonsurgical centers.

### Prenatal diagnosis and clinical implications of an apparently isolated right aortic arch [^113KQkip]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the associations of a prenatally diagnosed, apparently isolated right aortic arch (RAA) with chromosomal or genetic abnormalities and tracheal compression.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of apparently isolated RAA assessed by fetal cardiologists and fetal medicine specialists at Kings College Hospital, London between 2000 and 2017.

Results

The search identified 138 cases of apparently isolated RAA. Invasive testing was performed in 75, and chromosomal or genetic anomalies were identified in 16 (22%), and the most common was 22q11 microdeletion. An aberrant left subclavian artery was seen in 51% of cases. Symptoms of a vascular ring were present in 24 of 97 (25%) children who were reviewed after birth. Bronchoscopy was performed in 33 children, and significant tracheal compression was diagnosed in 28, including 18 of 19 symptomatic and 10 of 14 asymptomatic children.

Conclusions

An apparently isolated RAA is associated with a high incidence of chromosomal or genetic abnormalities and a high incidence of tracheal compression in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Prenatal counselling for genetic associations and postnatal airway assessment in the context of the vascular anatomy is recommended.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116CBJWL]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Isolated arch abnormalities — With the introduction of the 3VV and 3VT views into obstetric anatomic ultrasound protocols over the past 10 years, there has been an increase in referrals for suspected great artery and arch abnormalities despite an otherwise normal appearing four-chamber and outflow tract evaluation. In particular, the 3VT view has a characteristic appearance with two similarly sized arches forming a "V" to the left of the trachea, and size discrepancy, abnormal color flow direction, "U" shape, and separation of the SVC and trachea with one or two intervening arches will alert the examiner to abnormalities including coarctation, ductal aneurysm, right aortic arch, and vascular rings, including double aortic arch and right aortic arch with left ductus arteriosus with or without aberrant subclavian artery. Assuming intracardiac abnormalities have been excluded, imaging is straightforward; a combination of axial, sagittal, and parasagittal imaging with 2D and color Doppler to follow the course of both the ductal and aortic arches with attention to the origins of the head and upper extremity vessels will lead to a correct diagnosis. The use of color and power Doppler in the 3VT view is helpful in detecting an aberrant subclavian artery, retrograde flow in the vessels, or antegrade flow in the smaller of two arches in double aortic arch. A pulmonary artery sling can also be recognized in this view; although a sling is not a vascular ring, these patients may have airway abnormalities, including tracheal rings, and delivery should occur in an appropriate setting to allow assisted ventilation if needed.

### Prenatal diagnosis of the right aortic arch: change in detection rate, the status of associated anomalies, and perinatal outcomes in 137 fetuses [^1134y7bw]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

To evaluate prenatal findings of the right aortic arch (RAA), associated cardiac, extracardiac, and genetic anomalies, its perinatal outcomes and the need for postnatal interventions in cases of isolated RAA with a view to facilitating appropriate counseling. This was a multicenter, cohort study, that was undertaken in two international major cardiac centers between 2009 and 2020. The study subjects were prenatally diagnosed RAA cases with and without other structural cardiac defects. A RAA was identified in 137 fetuses. There were 84 cases of isolated RAA. Associations with additional intracardiac malformations were found in 53 (38.7%) cases. An extracardiac anomaly was observed in 26/137 (18.9%) fetuses, 11/84 (13.0%) fetuses with isolated RAA, and 15/53 (28.3%) fetuses with an additional intracardiac anomaly. The incidence of extracardiac and chromosomal anomalies was significantly higher in cases of RAA with abnormal intracardiac anatomy (28.3–18.8%, respectively), compared with RAA with normal intracardiac anatomy (13.0–5.9%, respectively) (p < 0.05). 22q11.2 microdeletion was found higher in RAA with CHD (4/18 fetuses) than isolated RAA (2/24 fetuses) (22.2% vs. 8.3% respectively). ALSA was present in 19.3% of cases. ALSA was more frequently observed in cases of isolated RAA (23.6%), than in RAA with structural CHD (7.6%) (p < 0.05). The pregnancy was interrupted in six fetuses, and one died in utero. The mortality rate was higher in fetuses with intracardiac anomaly than RAA without cardiac anomaly (11/49 (22.4%) vs. 2/81 (2.4%). Vascular ring formation was revealed in 21/98 cases. The RAA caused symptoms of a vascular ring in only one patient (0.7%) requiring surgery in the follow-up. Overall survival after initial diagnosis in the total cohort was 85.4% with 38 of 53 (71%) RAA with CHD cases and 79 of 84 (94.0%) isolated RAA cases. Chromosomal and extracardiac anomalies are lower in isolated RAA but not negligible hence amniocentesis should be routinely offered in all cases. The requirement for postnatal intervention in the immediate neonatal period is remote, therefore delivery of these fetuses need not be undertaken at a cardiac or surgical center.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112iSNrH]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Aortic and ductal arch evaluation in fetal echocardiography should document laterality and assess vascular anatomy in the 3VT view. Aortic and ductal arch laterality (sidedness) should be documented as part of every fetal echocardiographic examination, and vascular anatomy should be assessed in the 3VT view given that vascular rings, slings, and right aortic arch are readily detectable by fetal echocardiography. Attempts should be made to diagnose aberrant subclavian artery origin, especially if an aortic arch laterality abnormality is suspected.

### Prenatal diagnosis of right aortic arch: associated findings, pregnancy outcome, and clinical significance of vascular rings [^1114oMm5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To analyze the characteristics and clinical implications of right aortic arch (RAA) detected in fetal life.

Methods

Retrospective study of all cases of RAA diagnosed prenatally in high-risk patients who underwent fetal echocardiography between 2000 and 2007.

Results

There were 48 RAA; 18 had vascular ring (Group 1), including 15 RAA with aberrant left subclavian artery and 3 double aortic arch, and 30 had not vascular ring (Group 2), all RAA with mirror-image branching. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 94%. In Group 1 most fetuses had normal heart (89%), and none had 22q11 deletion. There were 16 live births and all infants but one are asymptomatic (mean follow-up of 31 months). In Group 2 almost all fetuses had congenital heart defects (CHDs) (97%), and five were chromosomally abnormal (17%), including four 22q11 deleted. The 1-year survival rate was 69%, which was significantly higher in Group 1 (89% vs 57%, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

RAA can be accurately diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. The outlook for these patients largely depends on the presence of associated defects, mainly CHDs, and their severity. If isolated, aortic arch anomalies are asymptomatic vascular variants in most cases. This information is important to assist parental counseling in pregnancy.

### A right-sided aortic arch misdiagnosed as asthma since childhood [^111EeYJg]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital malformation of the aortic arch complex occurs in 3% of humans. These vascular aberrations result from embryonic structures that persist when there is incomplete atrophy or regression during normal development. Typically, anomalies of the aortic arch do not cause respiratory symptoms. However, in some individuals, the unusual position of the remnant vessels may compress the airway and cause airflow limitation. As might be expected, a symptomatic vascular anomaly is most often clinically apparent in childhood. We report an adult male with exertional dyspnea who had been diagnosed with asthma since childhood. After his symptoms proved refractory to newer asthmatic therapy, he was referred for further evaluation. Bronchial hyperactivity was not present with objective testing, and compression of his trachea by a right-sided aortic arch was confirmed with appropriate imaging studies. This report illustrates the need to confirm the diagnosis of asthma with objective measures of airflow and reminds the clinician that a congenital vascular aberrancy may initially elude diagnosis.

A female neonate, born after a gestation of 38 weeks and 6 days, received a diagnosis of ductal shock at the age of 2 days, along with vascular ring with right-sided interrupted aortic arch, right-sided descending aorta, right-sided patent ductus arteriosus, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. At 3 days of age, the infant underwent bilateral pulmonary artery banding. At the age of 3 months and 29 days, she underwent a Norwood-type operation and release of the vascular ring. At age 23 months, she underwent a Rastelli-type operation. Successful surgical repair of this anomaly has yet not been reported.

### Conversion of left-to a right-sided aortic arch: a radical approach for select indications [^112a8fzR]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic graft infections, anomalous arch anatomy, and vascular rings may cause tracheal and/or esophageal compression. These circumstances often create challenging clinical dilemmas such that anatomical repair either does not eliminate the pathologic process completely or poses a measurable risk of recurrence. We describe a novel approach that facilitates complete relocation of the thoracic aorta to either prevent graft placement in an infected field or prevent tracheal and/or esophageal compression that effectively converts left-sided to right-sided arch anatomy.

Of the total cohort, 76% (15 medical, 4 surgical) exhibited respiratory and/or feeding related symptoms at least once during the period of surveillance (Table 2). The most common symptoms included noisy breathing (68%; 65% medical vs 80% of surgical patients), choking or dysphagia (36%; 25% medical vs 80% surgical), and recurrent emesis (20%; 10% medical vs 60% surgical). Presence of choking/dysphagia (p = 0.04), recurrent emesis (p = 0.03), and the combination of both digestive symptoms and noisy breathing (p = 0.01) were associated with surgical referral. Change in weight z‐scores from newborn visit to last subspecialty follow‐up were similar between medical and surgical patients (p = 0.98). During the study period, 15 children (60%; 12 medical, 3 surgical) were discharged from care and 10 (40%) were still followed.

The prevalence of noncritical congenital heart disease was 20%. Arch anatomy determined by transthoracic echocardiogram included 14 cases (56%) with an aberrant left subclavian arterial origin and 11 (44%) with mirror image branching. One child was diagnosed with asthma and one child was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. Extracardiac anomalies were uncommon (< 5%). When performed, neither prenatal nor postnatal genetic testing of the study population revealed abnormalities, including 22q11 deletion syndrome (Table 2).

Congenital cardiovascular malformations — atrioventricular and arterial connections: Transitional atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is a variant of complete AVSD with an interatrial communication immediately above the atrioventricular valve and a restrictive interventricular communication immediately below the atrioventricular valve. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital cardiovascular malformation with luminal narrowing most commonly at the junction between the aortic arch and the descending aorta. Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA or L-loop TGA) is defined by atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance in which the right atrium connects to the LV, the left atrium connects to the RV, the RV connects to the aorta, and the LV connects to the pulmonary trunk. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which both great arteries arise entirely or predominantly from the RV. Interrupted aortic arch is a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is no luminal continuity between the ascending and descending aorta. Coronary anomaly includes congenital anomalous origin and/or course of the coronary arteries and coronary arteriovenous or coronary-cameral fistulae in the setting of normal conotronal anatomy while excluding myocardial bridges, coronary artery reimplantation after Ross procedure and arterial switch operation, and anomalies related to supravalvular aortic stenosis. Double-chambered RV is a congenital cardiac malformation in which the RV is divided into 2 chambers — 1 inferior that includes the inlet and trabecular portion of the RV and 1 superior that includes the trabecular portion and infundibulum.

### Vascular rings in the current era: is this a new disease requiring a new approach? [^115zsZq3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, vascular rings, formed by a right or double aortic arch, have been diagnosed in childhood following symptoms or signs of tracheo-oesophageal compression. Many of these features might be attributed to other non-surgical diagnoses, such as asthma, postviral symptoms or simply, sensory feeding behaviours. This has often led to families being falsely reassured, resulting in delayed referral to specialist services for assessment and definitive surgical treatment. Despite surgery, it is common for these postnatally diagnosed patients to have persistent symptoms. In the modern era, most vascular rings are diagnosed prenatally, having been identified on routine ultrasound screening in mid-pregnancy. This has resulted in an exponential increase in the diagnosis of the right aortic arch and double aortic arch, leading to a new form of these conditions for health practitioners to manage-a diagnosis prior to possible clinical presentation. Early symptoms of a vascular ring may be subtle, atypical or not evident despite having a significant degree of tracheal compression, and thus, there is a window for early intervention before symptoms affect a child's health. Understanding which patients with vascular rings can be managed conservatively and which require surgery to improve outcomes and reduce longer-term morbidity and physical limitations is crucial. The recent literature on the diagnosis, assessment, management and outcomes of isolated vascular rings is reviewed, and our institutional pathway to manage these patients is discussed.

### Influence of fetal diagnosis on the clinical presentation of a vascular ring [^111Ta7bn]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

A fetus had a diagnosis of a vascular ring formed by a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery. The infant experienced isolated dysphagia and vomiting 3 months after birth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the vascular ring and demonstrated profound, isolated esophageal dilation with normal airways. The severity of postnatal symptoms due to a vascular ring is difficult to determine in utero. Expectant management of the lesion is necessary, and use of MRI as the imaging method allows for both confirmation of the diagnosis and evaluation of the airway and esophagus while avoiding radiation.

### Two cases of a prenatally diagnosed double aortic arch with postnatal obliteration of the distal left aortic arch [^1177fEn3]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

We report two cases of prenatally diagnosed double aortic arch with dominant right arch and a left-sided ductus arteriosus, consistent with a complete vascular ring. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus and obliteration of the left aortic arch distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery in both cases. Spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus involving extended ductal tissue in the left aortic arch likely led to obliteration of the distal left arch after birth. One patient presented with recurrent symptoms suggestive of dysphagia and underwent a successful surgical repair of the vascular ring with resolution of symptoms. The other patient has been asymptomatic and is 4 years old at the time of this report.

### Coarctation of the aorta: prenatal assessment, postnatal management and neonatal outcomes [^115zihWB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (Coa) is a potentially life threatening diagnosis. It occurs in 0.3 per 1000 live births and accounts for 6–8% of all infants with congenital heart defects. Neonates with severe Coa may be completely asymptomatic at birth, as the ductus arteriosus can provide flow to the lower body. Those who are not diagnosed prenatally may be diagnosed only after constriction of the ductus arteriosus, when they present in cardiogenic shock. This group has a higher risk for mortality and morbidity relative to those diagnosed prenatally. Despite the increasing practice of universal pulse oximetry screening, many cases with significant coarctation of the aorta still go undiagnosed in the newborn period. In this article, we present the pathophysiology, diagnosis, presentation, treatment and outcomes of Coa.

### Vascular ring: prenatal diagnosis and prognostic management based on sequential cross-sectional scanning by ultrasound [^115ZrGmF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis of congenital vascular rings is intended to improve the symptoms of compression in patients with airway compression. With the increase of prenatal detection rate of vascular rings, the incidence of rare diseases has been realized to be twice that of tetralogy of Fallot, and the evaluation of the relationship between vascular rings and airways is more important. However, there are few articles on the prenatal diagnosis of vascular ring diseases and with qualitative or quantitative assessments of airway prognosis in PubMed. Several cases of vascular rings suggested by prenatal diagnosis and requiring tracheal intubation immediately after birth were reported, and no airway condition was suggested prenatally. Achiron et al. first proposed prenatal assessment of vascular rings and airway compression, but the study limitations were subjective qualitative rather than quantitative assessment of airway compression. Chest X-ray is not routinely recommended to diagnose vascular rings after birth, even though it can be useful to show the location of the aortic arch in relation to the trachea. Computed tomography with angiography (CTA) is an important tool that allows for a careful simultaneous assessment of vascular abnormalities and airway involvement. To assess the prognosis of congenital vascular ring disease in the fetus and by following the principle of CT in postnatal diagnostic evaluation, we proposed the dynamic evaluation of the influence of vascular rings on the airway by continuous transverse scanning during the fetal period. The distance between the airway and the blood vessels forming the ring was managed by semi-quantitative grading. This set of data shows the following: (1) Compared with the other types of vascular rings, PAS may have compression symptoms in the fetal period, and the prognosis is relatively poor. If it can be maintained until birth, immediate surgery is needed to improve the symptoms, and the improvement of symptoms after surgery is still affected by tracheomalacia. (2) The second most common type to have a poor prognosis is DAA. In these data, in addition to terminating fetuses, 5 babies developed respiratory symptoms in the first six months of life, which is mainly related to the "O" ring and closed ring formed by double aortic arches. (3) RAA mirror-brunching imaging and RAA-ALSA can also be involved. The "U"-shaped ring formed by the right aortic arch and ductal arch has a relatively low risk of airway compression. However, there are branches in the vascular ring, and when the branches are close to the airway, they and the right arch may bring some risks to airway compression. According to this set of data, the ICCA branch of RAA-ALSA may present a higher risk of airway compression than the L-INA of RAA mirror-brunching imaging, but the risk is lower than that of the first two vascular rings. The prognosis is relatively good. (4) The farthest distance was LAA-ARSA, and there was no obvious airway compression in the group with the best prognosis. These results are consistent with literature reports. ARSA does not demonstrate any apparent clinical symptoms, but it is used as a soft marker of ultrasound. When ARSA is observed with other ultrasound abnormalities, the risk of pathogenic CNV is increased remarkably; therefore, a prenatal diagnosis is very important.

### Current readings on surgery for the neonate with hypoplastic aortic arch [^1167CqDn]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic arch hypoplasia is commonly present in neonates born with ductal-dependent coarctation of the aorta. The ideal surgical repair of neonates with proximal arch hypoplasia continues to be debated. Controversy exists about the fate of the hypoplastic proximal aortic arch following surgical repair and whether that will eventually grow to normal size upon relief of the distal obstruction or will persist as a residual lesion that can affect the long-term outlook of those patients. There is new evidence that residual proximal arch hypoplasia and the shape of the reconstructed arch both have an important impact on vascular remodeling and on the subsequent development of hypertension. Those concerns about late outcomes despite what was originally deemed a successful repair in infancy, coupled with improved cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral perfusion techniques that allow surgeons to address proximal arch hypoplasia with low morbidity, have rekindled the debate on how to address proximal arch hypoplasia, with the aim to offer a neonatal surgery that would last for a lifetime and provide both optimal early recovery and late freedom from hypertension and related complications.

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate.

Structure

Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Vascular ring: prenatal diagnosis and prognostic management based on sequential cross-sectional scanning by ultrasound [^111tceso]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In terms of embryonic origin, vascular ring is a congenital anomaly in which the aortic arch and its branches completely or incompletely encircle and compress the trachea or esophagus. The common vascular rings are left aortic arch with right subclavian artery vagus (LAA with ARSA), right aortic arch with mirror-image branching (RAA with mirror-image branching), right aortic arch with left subclavian artery vagus (RAA with ALSA), double aortic arch (DAA), and pulmonary artery sling (PAS). The different types of vascular rings have different incidences, clinical manifestations and severities. Symptoms frequently encountered include noisy breathing and a barky cough, recurrent upper respiratory infections, wheezing, exertional dyspnea, and dysphagia. Children often present with symptoms in the first few months of life and require surgery within the first year of life. Delaying treatment may result in sudden death or residual tracheobronchial damage. Postpartum diagnosis mainly depends on MDCT. Prenatal diagnosis of vascular ring is relatively difficult. In recent years, the value of the three-vessel tracheal view in fetal echocardiography in the diagnosis of vascular ring diseases has been recognized, but the guidelines state that only fetuses with high risk factors receive specialized fetal echocardiography. Most fetuses receive only a basic cardiac examination, and the success of detection depends on the operator's experience and knowledge of the disease. Therefore, the rate of missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses remains high, in particular, for isolated vascular rings, prenatal data statistics are only 1 in 1000. There is also a lack of quantitative assessment of the risk of fetal airway compression caused by the vascular ring. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of prenatal ultrasound in the integrated management of vascular ring.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115gz4oz]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Aortic arch aneurysm — management recommendations specify that in patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who have symptoms attributable to the aneurysm and are at a low or intermediate operative risk, open surgical replacement is recommended. In patients with an isolated aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic and have a low operative risk, open surgical replacement at an arch diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm is reasonable. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal aortic arch, it is reasonable to extend the repair with a hemiarch replacement. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an aortic arch aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal descending thoracic aorta, an elephant trunk procedure may be considered. In patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic but meet criteria for intervention, but have a high risk from open surgical repair, a hybrid or endovascular approach may be reasonable.

### NeoQuest December 2021: stridor in a newborn… [^112DA2Nu]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Option A). Stridor is a high-pitched respiratory sound suggestive of an airway anomaly. 3 A DAA is typically an isolated anomaly but can be associated with intracardiac defects in 1% of neonates. 4, 5 Surgical correction by ligating the duplicated arch is necessary and curative since affected patients are often symptomatic.
2. A left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery is a type of incomplete vascular ring. Infants with this vascular anomaly are predominantly asymptomatic but can present with feeding difficulties such as dysphagia later in life secondary to extrinsic esophageal compression. 3, 5, 6 This anomaly occurs following the regression of the right fourth aortic arch between the right common carotid and right subclavian artery rather than distal to the subclavian artery.

5, 6 Surgery is indicated in patients who are symptomatic and involves reconstruction of the right subclavian artery to avoid a "subclavian steal" phenomenon. 5 Our patient had an isolated vascular ring with respiratory and feeding symptoms notable at birth with imaging confirming a complete vascular ring, therefore ruling out a left arch with aberrant right subclavian artery. The second most common cause of a complete vascular ring following a DAA is a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and left-sided ligament arteriosum, while a CTA or magnetic resonance angiography is diagnostic. 8 Approximately 10% of patients have accompanying intracardiac defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot or truncus arteriosus. 6, 8 Surgical repair consists of ligation of the ligamentum arteriosum.

### Diagnosis, imaging and clinical management of aortic coarctation [^112dNsmq]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a well-known congenital heart disease (CHD), which is often associated with several other cardiac and vascular anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and aortic arch hypoplasia. Despite echocardiographic screening, prenatal diagnosis of C o A remains difficult. Most patients with CoA present in infancy with absent, delayed or reduced femoral pulses, a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient (> 20mm Hg), or a murmur due to rapid blood flow across the CoA or associated lesions (BAV). Transthoracic echocardiography is the primary imaging modality for suspected CoA. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred advanced imaging modality for non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of CoA. Adequate and timely diagnosis of CoA is crucial for good prognosis, as early treatment is associated with lower risks of long-term morbidity and mortality. Numerous surgical and transcatheter treatment strategies have been reported for CoA. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in neonates, infants and young children. In older children (> 25kg) and adults, transcatheter treatment is the treatment of choice. In the current era, patients with CoA continue to have a reduced life expectancy and an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae later in life, despite adequate relief of the aortic stenosis. Intensive and adequate follow-up of the left ventricular function, valvular function, blood pressure and the anatomy of the heart and the aorta are, therefore, critical in the management of CoA. This review provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art clinical diagnosis, diagnostic imaging algori thms, treatment and follow-up of patients with CoA.

If not detected prenatally or with pulse oximetry screening, neonates with coarctation of the aorta may present in clinical distress with significant metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure at the time of ductal closure. The lesion may be ductal dependent, requiring prostaglandin infusion and other supportive measures for resuscitation and survival of the patient until more definitive treatment can be undertaken. Accurate detailed diagnosis is essential prior to any intervention. Echocardiography is the first line imaging modality and may be all that is needed in infants with simple coarctation or associated intracardiac defects. If portions of the aorta proximal or distal to the coarctation or branching vessels are not well visualized, CMR can provide full anatomical details and may be superior to echocardiography.

Coarctation may also present later in childhood or early adulthood, usually in the setting of referral for hypertension or heart murmur and diminished lower extremity pulses. Depending on the age of the patient, chest X-ray may demonstrate rib notching such as when significant large collateral vessels may be present. When a native coarctation of the aorta is first diagnosed in an older child or adult by echocardiography, CMR is then used to define the anatomical and hemodynamic severity in preparation for treatment by surgery or in the cardiac cath lab. Echocardiography may demonstrate the unusual arch anatomy and abnormal Doppler flow patterns through the obstruction, but due to limited acoustic windows, may not allow for full visualization of the coarctation or its proximal and distal segments, aortic arch branching abnormalities, or the presence and magnitude of associated collateral vessels which are all important pieces of clinical information to aid in determining the appropriate method of intervention.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^116yqQob]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prenatally a right aortic arch with a left ductus arteriosus represents the anatomic substrate for a vascular ring. However, it does not predict future presence, degree, or progression of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms. Our data demonstrate a variable postnatal clinical course for a cohort of young children with a primary fetal diagnosis of iRAA. Often, even in symptomatic infants, surgical intervention may not be necessary if the infant is thriving and is not experiencing serious developmental compromise related to feeding or sleep. Overall, 80% of infants and toddlers in our study were medically managed in the absence of severe aerodigestive symptoms due to a vascular ring, and growth outcomes were similar between patients referred for surgery and those who were not.

In our review, we identified three common clinical patterns associated with iRAA. First, some patients (5) never developed respiratory or feeding related symptoms. A second group (15 patients) experienced intermittent aerodigestive symptoms that frequently resolved by 24 months of life. They occasionally had progression of their respiratory and/or feeding related symptoms that may not have been a consequence of their vascular anatomy. For example, we followed an infant who had significant upper airway obstruction secondary to adenotonsillar hypertrophy that exacerbated their tracheomalacia. This infant was able to be managed with adenotonsillectomy and improved without the need for vascular surgery. This group also included infants with upper airway or digestive difficulties that were felt to be unrelated to their vascular anatomy. Third, a subset of patients (4) developed progressive symptoms with recurrent lower respiratory infections, increased noisy breathing, or worsening feeding related symptoms, which often coincided with introduction of solid foods. Further radiologic and airway evaluation revealed that the symptoms were most likely related to vascular compression of the trachea and/or esophagus by the right aortic arch and aberrant subclavian artery (Figure 3, A‐C). These infants benefited from surgery. Also within this group, there were instances when echocardiography did not correctly delineate all vascular anatomy. One infant in our cohort, initially described to have mirror image branching, developed progressive symptoms and was ultimately found to have a double aortic arch (predominant right arch with diminutive/nearly interrupted left arch) and managed surgically (Figure 3, D).

### The surgical management of aortic root vessel anomalies presenting in adults [^116PsNTt]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Anomalies of the aortic root vessels may present in adults and are common incidental findings during standard vascular imaging. Knowledge of their presentation and management is important for surgeons dealing with vascular pathology within these anomalous vessels. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and a review of the current opinion performed on the embryology, clinical features, and surgical treatment of aortic root vessel anomalies, with particular emphasis on their management in adults. A classification system for aortic arch anomalies based on arch configuration is presented: (1) double aortic arch, (2) right aortic arch, (3) left aortic arch with abnormal branching, and (4) interrupted aortic arch. Anomalies of the aortic root vessels may be classified based on their presence or absence, their anomalous size or course, or their atypical origin, bifurcation, or subsequent branching pattern. A symptomatic aberrant right subclavian artery may be encountered by vascular surgeons, and a right supraclavicular approach would appear the most appropriate method of repair. Knowledge of aortic arch and root vessel anomalies is important for any clinician dealing with cardiothoracic, head and neck, or intracranial pathology. Vascular surgeons may encounter these anomalies during routine practice and may need to deal with their clinical sequelae.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114SRWcH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA) — presentation, prevalence, and treatment indications are outlined. An aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA) is commonly an incidental finding but may present with compressive symptoms (including dysphagia and dyspnea) because it courses posterior to the esophagus and trachea and may associate with aneurysm disease. A normal left aortic arch with a right ASCA occurs in ~1% of the population, whereas a right aortic arch with a left ASCA is much rarer and may form a vascular ring. Dilation of the origin of either a right or left ASCA occurs in 20% to 60% of cases and is known as a Kommerell diverticulum; such diverticula may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or embolization. Indications for treatment of ASCA relate to symptoms and aneurysm size.

### Multimedia article. thoracoscopic patch repair of a right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia in a neonate [^114VxTuU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Minimally invasive techniques continue to expand in pediatric surgery; however, there has been some debate over the appropriate operative technique for the management of congenital diaphragmatic hernias in neonates. We present a video of a thoracoscopic patch repair of a right-sided Bochdalek congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in a 3-day-old male.

Methods

Our patient was noted to have a right-sided CDH on chest X-ray following respiratory distress at the time of birth. The patient's remaining neonatal workup also confirmed hypoplastic transverse aortic arch with coarctation, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus, which were initially diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. After monitoring the patient for hemodynamic stability and discussion with the family and involved pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, the decision was made to proceed with a thoracoscopic repair of the CDH.

Results

The large right-sided CDH was noted to involve herniated small bowel, colon, and liver. The diaphragmatic defect was successfully repaired thoracoscopically using a 5 × 5 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch. The patient was extubated on the second postoperative day and ultimately underwent aortic arch augmentation, VSD closure, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation and division at 1 month of age. There has been no evidence of CDH recurrence in follow-up.

Conclusions

As demonstrated by our video, large right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernias requiring patch repair can be successfully repaired thoracoscopically with appropriate surgeon comfort and experience. This minimally invasive approach may also be used in neonates with associated cardiac defects with appropriate cardiothoracic surgical consultation and support. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a thoracoscopic repair of a Bochdalek (posterolateral) hernia with a prosthetic patch in a neonate with significant congenital cardiac anomalies.

Top 10 take-home messages for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease — because outcomes for patients with aortic disease are enhanced at programs with higher volumes, experienced practitioners, and extensive management capabilities, "Multidisciplinary Aortic Team care is considered in determining the appropriate timing of intervention". Shared decision-making involving the patient and a multidisciplinary team is "highly encouraged" to determine the optimal medical, endovascular, and open surgical therapies, and in patients contemplating pregnancy or who are pregnant it is "especially important" when considering cardiovascular risks, diameter thresholds for prophylactic aortic surgery, and mode of delivery. Imaging guidance states that computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiographic imaging "should follow recommended approaches for image acquisition, measurement and reporting of relevant aortic dimensions, and the frequency of surveillance before and after intervention". At centers with Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams and experienced surgeons, "the threshold for surgical intervention for sporadic aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysms has been lowered from 5.5 cm to 5.0 cm in selected patients, and even lower in specific scenarios among patients with heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms".

### Prenatal cardiac findings and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: fetal detection and evaluation [^112d9QmX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) are highly variable between affected individuals and frequently include a subset of conotruncal and aortic arch anomalies. Many are diagnosed with 22q11.2DS when they present as a fetus, newborn or infant with characteristic cardiac findings and subsequently undergo genetic testing. The presence of an aortic arch anomaly with characteristic intracardiac anomalies increases the likelihood that the patient has 22q11.2 DS, but those with an aortic arch anomaly and normal intracardiac anatomy are also at risk. It is particularly important to identify the fetus at risk for 22q11.2DS in order to prepare the expectant parents and plan postnatal care for optimal outcomes. Fetal anatomy scans now readily identify aortic arch anomalies (aberrant right subclavian artery, right sided aortic arch or double aortic arch) in the three-vessel tracheal view. Given the association of 22q11.2DS with aortic arch anomalies with and without intracardiac defects, this review highlights the importance of recognizing the fetus at risk for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with an aortic arch anomaly and details current methods for genetic testing. To assist in the prenatal diagnosis of 22q11.2DS, this review summarizes the seminal features of 22q11.2DS, its prenatal presentation and current methods for genetic testing.

### Contemporary management and natural history of aberrant right subclavian artery [^113dq2Kg]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

An aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch. A paucity of reported studies is available regarding the treatment of these patients. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the contemporary management strategies and natural history of ARSA in these patients.

Methods

A single-center retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of ARSA from 2009 to 2019 was performed. Computed tomography scans were analyzed, and the aortic and ARSA diameters were measured at 10 different segments. The demographic data, comorbidities, and operative interventions were collected. The patients were categorized into those who had undergone intervention and those who had undergone expectant management. Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate the annual ARSA diameter changes.

Results

A total of 30 patients with ARSA were identified, 17 (57%) of whom were women. The average age for the cohort was 54.5 ± 14.6 years. Of the 30 patients, 20 (67%) had undergone operative repair at presentation and 10 (33%) were initially observed. The most common presenting symptom was dysphagia (30%). Of the 10 patients who had been initially treated expectantly, 4 had subsequently required intervention. Of the 24 operative interventions, 13 (54%) were hybrid procedures involving right carotid-subclavian bypass or transposition and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The mean diameter of ARSA at its origin was 20.4 ± 5.7 mm, and the mean cross-sectional aortic diameter at the level of the ARSA was 31.8 ± 8.5 mm for the entire cohort. For the patients who had initially been observed and had subsequently required intervention, the largest change in the ARSA cross-sectional diameter was observed 1 cm distally to the vessel ostium at a rate of 3.05 mm annually (95% confidence interval, 1.54–4.56; P < .001). No statistically significant changes in the annual growth rate of the aortic segments were observed in the entire cohort or for those patients who had undergone intervention (P > .05).

Conclusions

The decision to intervene on an ARSA should be individualized by the presence of symptoms (eg, dysphagia lusoria) or complications (eg, dissection, concomitant aortic aneurysmal disease, enlarging Kommerell diverticulum). Asymptomatic patients with nonaneurysmal ARSA might not require any intervention and can be safely observed. Measurement of the cross-sectional ARSA diameter 1 cm distally to the ostium of the vessel might aid in the surveillance of vessel diameter changes. Additional studies are required to determine the specific size criteria as an indication for operative repair of asymptomatic Kommerell diverticulum.

### Coarctation of the aorta in the right aortic arch with left aberrant innominate artery [^114hfvbF]. Pediatric Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Right aortic arch with an aberrant left innominate artery is a rare combination. We report a unique case of coarctation of the aorta in a patient with right aortic arch and aberrant left innominate artery. The diverticulum of Kommerell gave rise to the left innominate artery and a left ligamentum arteriosum, completing a vascular ring. This unusual case raises interesting points regarding the development of coarctation in the context of a right-sided arch and the approach to management of these patients.

### Two cases of a rare association: double aortic arch with tetralogy of Fallot [^114yMx1Z]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

DAA is a form of vascular rings, completely encircling trachea and esophagus by its connecting segments, which may cause stridor, respiratory distress or dysphagia in the first months of life. During embryogenesis a failure of the normal regression of one or more segments of the six pairs of the aortic arches that arise from the truncus arteriosus leads to the formation of multiple anomalies of the aortic arch, to form DAA. The vascular ring anomaly of the aortic arch comprises 1% of operable congenital cardiac disease. In DAA patients, right or left arch may be larger or similar in size, or one arch can be atretic. But in clinic practices, right arch is dominant in more than 75% of these cases. In the present case, the patients had a DAA with a non-dominant left arch. DAA has been abundantly described in previous studies and its management is well established.

TOF is one of common cyanotic congenital heart disease that occurs in approximately 1 in 3600 live births and accounts for 3.5% of infants born with congenital heart disease. Surgical repair was first introduced in the 1950s, and nowadays most patients with TOF can undergo compete repair with a low operative mortality and a excellent long-term survival rate.

For patients with TOF, exertional dyspnoea is a common symptom. And DAA with mild stridor or dysphagia or without might be undetected preoperatively. So it is important for echocardiographic investigation to recognize before operation. A suprasternal fossa short-axis and long-axis view of aorta is necessary for echocardiographic investigation to find DAA anomalies. Once a suspected DAA is detected by echocardiography, a CT or cardiac catheterization check is vital for confirming anomalies and surgery treatment.

### Interrupted aortic arch | NCBDDD… [^114R4L2e]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Interrupted Aortic Arch Interrupted aortic arch is a structural heart defect characterized anatomically by a discontinuity along the aortic arch. Depending on the site of discontinuity, IAA is classified into three types, of which type B is the most frequent. Type A is less common and type C is rare.
- Type A: The discontinuity is distal to the left subclavian artery. Type B, the most common form: The discontinuity is more proximal, between the left carotid and subclavian.
- **Type C**: The discontinuity is more proximal still, between the brachiocephalic artery and the common carotid artery. Fig.
20. Interrupted aortic arch. Diagnosis IAA is easily missed on the obstetric anomaly scan, though it might be suspected based on discrepancy between the left and right ventricular sizes.

Whereas in expert hands fetal echocardiography can provide a firm diagnosis, prenatally diagnosed cases should be confirmed postnatally. Prenatal. Infants can present clinically in the early neonatal period, when the ductus closes, with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and systemic hypoperfusion. Newborn screening via pulse oximetry can lead to earlier diagnosis. Postnatal. Clinical and epidemiologic notes As noted, early presentation is one of heart failure and cardiogenic shock, with rapid clinical deterioration as the ductus closes. Because of right-to-left shunting at the ductus arteriosus, infants may initially show differential oxygen saturation or cyanosis. In type A, the difference in saturation is between upper and lower limbs; in type B, it is between the left and right arm. Ventricular septal defect and other intracardiac defects are often present.

The three types of IAA differ in their association with genetic risk factors. For example, deletion 22q11 occurs in 50% or more of cases of type B IAA, and is rare in the other types. Other syndromes that can occur with IAA include CHARGE syndrome.

### The neonatal hypoplastic aortic arch: decisions and more decisions [^114DR5sa]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2013). Low credibility.

Neonatal patients with hypoplasia of the aortic arch constitute a heterogeneous group with a wide spectrum of severity. The milder end of the spectrum comprises patients with aortic coarctation and isthmus hypoplasia. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with severe transverse arch hypoplasia or hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The aim of this paper is to discuss the various strategies and surgical approaches available for this group of patients, focusing on the surgical decisions that influence individual patient management. Many of the things discussed are applicable to any neonatal arch problem. We also describe and discuss in detail our surgical technique for patients who undergo neonatal repair of a hypoplastic aortic arch via median sternotomy.

A 3-week-old ex-37-week male (3.4 kg, body surface area 0.2 m²) presented with increased work of breathing, requiring continuous positive airway pressure to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 90%. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an anteriorly displaced conal septum, large unrestrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defect with inlet extension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOT) consistent with TOF. The PA z score was –0.49. An 8-mm APW was seen between the aorta and distal main PA, with significant hypoplasia of the right PA and right lung, exacerbating his tenuous respiratory status. Three-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography imaging provided detailed anatomic definition and spatial relationships of these complex lesions. The RAA was confirmed with an isolated subclavian artery arising from the left PA through a patent ductus arteriosus without evidence of any aortopulmonary collaterals (Figure 2, A-D). The right lung hypoplasia shifted the heart posterolaterally, complicating surgical exposure for full repair. However, virtual heart mapping using EchoPixel (EchoPixel) improved understanding of the spatial relationships and topography, particularly regarding accessibility of the right atrium and ventricle, given the extreme rightward displacement of the heart, and the extent of the APW to the arch vessels for crossclamping and cardioplegia. The surgical team was able to choreograph surgical sequences necessary for complete repair compared to palliation, which prompted multidisciplinary consensus for complete repair.

### Arch watch: current approaches and opportunities for improvement [^113mWKQj]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a ductus arteriosus (DA)-dependent form of congenital heart disease (CHD) characterized by narrowing in the region of the aortic isthmus. CoA is a challenging diagnosis to make prenatally and is the critical cardiac lesion most likely to go undetected on the pulse oximetry-based newborn critical CHD screen. When undetected CoA causes obstruction to blood flow, life-threatening cardiovascular collapse may result, with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamic monitoring practices during DA closure (known as an "arch watch") vary across institutions and existing tools are often insensitive to developing arch obstruction. Novel measures of tissue oxygenation and oxygen deprivation may improve sensitivity and specificity for identifying evolving hemodynamic compromise in the newborn with CoA. We explore the benefits and limitations of existing and new tools to monitor the physiological changes of the aorta as the DA closes in infants at risk of CoA.

### Right ventricular enlargement in utero: is It coarctation? [^113NhjUx]. Pediatric Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Antenatal diagnosis of right heart enlargement has a wide spectrum of differential diagnosis from maternal, placental and fetal causes, and outcomes of all are not known. Coarctation of the aorta is in the differential diagnosis of right heart enlargement. In our study, we focused to measure multiple cardiac dimensions in fetuses with right heart enlargement to identify the fetus with coarctation of the aorta utilizing echocardiographic measurements. Ten cardiovascular dimensions were measured from fetal studies between 20- and 34-week gestation, and six were measured on postnatal echocardiograms. Z-scores for the cardiac dimensions were calculated, and each variable for fetuses and infants was tested using a two-sample t test between patients with and without coarctation. We excluded fetuses with TAPVR, Shone complex, interrupted aortic arch, Ebstein anomaly or HLHS. Of the 31 fetuses with in utero right heart enlargement, 11 had coarctation postnatally and 20 did not have coarctation. We compared the fetal and newborn cardiac dimensions between the groups. The mean fetal carotid-subclavian index (CS Index) was 0.7 mm with coarctation compared with 1.1 mm without coarctation (p < 0.0001). The mean difference in diameter z-scores for fetal aortic isthmus (p < 0.0001), mitral valve (< 0.001) and aortic valve (p < 0.009) was also significantly different. Similar significant differences were noted postnatally in the diameters of the cardiac dimensions between the coarctation and no-coarctation group: CS index (p < 0.0001), aortic isthmus (p < 0.0002) and aortic valve annulus (p < 0.007). A spectrum of diagnoses was found postnatally in fetuses with right heart enlargement, including a normal heart. The likelihood of identifying fetuses with coarctation of the aorta and planning for postnatal management can be refined by noninvasive screening measurements. A smaller CS index and smaller diameters of the aortic isthmus, mitral valve and aortic valve were significantly associated prenatally (p < 0.05) with coarctation of the aorta versus without coarctation and might be useful in prenatally diagnosing coarctation of the aorta. Postnatally, these measurements are reproducible. This is the first study utilizing these specific measurements to diagnose coarctation prenatally.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^113ZL4Cs]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Pediatric patients with iRAA prenatal diagnosis who present as infants and toddlers with progressive and severe aerodigestive symptoms attributed to a vascular ring are likely to undergo detailed postnatal imaging and surgical evaluation. However, longitudinal clinical data on a cohort of prenatal iRAA patients are not yet available to justify an identical approach for all prenatal iRAA diagnoses. Our study highlights a decade of thoughtful collaboration between fetal cardiologists, pediatric cardiologists, and pediatric pulmonologists following prenatal iRAA diagnoses. We present our institutional management approach (Figure 1) to acknowledge the uncertainty of prenatal vascular ring pathophysiology and provide clinical guidance based on evolution of postnatal symptoms. In studying our postnatal cohort, we observed that most prenatally diagnosed children with iRAA did not develop serious aerodigestive symptoms within their first 2 years of life.

### Management and outcomes of double aortic arch in 81 patients [^116SFPx9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Double aortic arch is a common form of complete vascular ring, encircling both the trachea and esophagus, resulting in noncardiac morbidity. We sought to describe management and outcomes in a large single institution clinical series.

Patients and Methods

We reviewed the medical charts of all of the patients diagnosed with double aortic arch at age < 18 years. Data regarding clinical presentation, anatomy, management, and outcomes were abstracted.

Results

We identified 81 patients (67% males) born between 1964 and 2005 and presenting at a median age of 5 months (range: birth to 10.3 years). Respiratory symptoms were present in 91%, including stridor in 77%. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 40%, with choking with feeds being most common. The dominant branch of the double aortic arch was right in 72%. Associated cardiac anomalies were present in 18%, with noncardiac anomalies in 7%. Repair was performed in 79 patients at a median age of 6 months. There were 2 deaths after surgical repair with no late deaths, with Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 96% at 5 years. Postoperative complications included chylothorax in 9%. Only 1 patient required reoperation. The most common symptoms at most recent follow-up were respiratory (54%) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (6%). Postoperative tracheal stenosis was documented in 14%, with tracheomalacia in 7%. There were no late reoperations and no evidence of aortic arch obstruction.

Conclusions

Outcomes are excellent after repair of double aortic arch, although persistent respiratory symptoms are frequent and probably associated with previous compression-related maldevelopment of the trachea and major airways.

### Fetal double aortic arch: prenatal sonographic and postnatal computed tomography angiography features, associated abnormalities and clinical outcomes [^116TYVpP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the abovementioned sonographic characteristics of DAA, most DAAs can be diagnosed by prenatal echocardiography. The three-vessel tracheal view is the most characteristic view for DAA diagnosis, but it alone is not enough, especially when an arch shows atresia, in which a vascular ring is not always typical as a result of an interruption in the blood flow of the atretic segment and then differential diagnosis with a right aortic arch is challenging. At this time, multiple views should be performed to better observe the origin, course, and branches of the two arches. The following steps and key points for systematic examination are recommended. (1) Whether the right aortic arch is present on the three-vessel tracheal view should be confirmed. (2) A search for bifurcation of the ascending aorta in the left ventricular outflow tract view is needed; it is necessary to trace the ascending aorta far enough into the arch as the bifurcation is usually not at the origin of the ascending aorta. (3) The three-vessel tracheal view and sagittal view of the aortic arch should be used to confirm that the left and right arches both arise from the ascending aorta and are connected to the descending aorta. (4) The three-vessel trachea view should be used to find the left and right arches surrounding the trachea and esophagus to form a complete O-shaped vascular ring; because the two arches may not be at the same level, the probe will need to be tilted slightly. (5) To determine the type of DAA, the inner diameter of the left and right arches need to be accurately measured. (6) The branching patterns of the left and right aortic arches on the sagittal views and coronal views of the aortic arch need to be confirmed. (7) Careful examination of the heart and other systems, including the thymus, should be performed to determine the existence of associated intracardiac or extracardiac malformations. (8) Chromosome and gene tests should be performed when necessary. Besides, adjusting the parameters of the color Doppler mode is necessary to reduce the scale of blood flow velocity to display a small nondominant arch fully. It is difficult to identify the fibrous cord formed by partial atresia of the nondominant arch by ultrasound examination, so the vascular ring needs to be diagnosed indirectly through the formation of a blind end or diverticulum of the arch. When the left arch is small and difficult to display, the only visible right arch should not be mistaken for the right pulmonary artery, which would also be going in the right direction.

Vascular Rings

The most common type of vascular ring, accounting for about 50–60% of cases, is double aortic arch, with persistence of both fourth arches. The double aortic arch may be right-dominant, left-dominant, or codominant, though right dominance occurs in the large majority (Figure 35). Portions of the double arch may also be atretic. Neonates may present with life-threatening complications of the airway. With significant tracheomalacia, symptoms may persist after surgical intervention, with some cases requiring further tracheal surgery.CMR has been demonstrated to successfully diagnose patent double arches and those with atretic portions and is superior to cardiac catheterization angiography in its ability to demonstrate associated compression of the airway.

Note the narrowing distally on the sagittal view and how both arches can be visualized in cross-section on the coronal (arrows). LAO indicates left aortic arch; and RAO, right aortic arch.

The next most common vascular ring type involves a right aortic arch (30–35% of cases) with aberrant left subclavian artery, left ligamentum arteriosum and diverticulum of Kommerell (Figure 36). A small portion of patients with right aortic arch may have mirror image branching and a retroesophageal ductal ligament that can identified by an aortic "dimple" delineated on CMR imaging (diverticulum) in conjunction with tracheal and esophageal compression. Both double aortic arch and right aortic arches constituting vascular rings have been known to occur in conjunction with CHD such as TOF.

2 Methods

2.1 Setting

This was a single center retrospective cohort study conducted at a rural academic medical center (The University of Vermont Children's Hospital). Our center provides the only maternal fetal medicine, fetal cardiology, pediatric cardiology, and pediatric pulmonology services in the state of Vermont, and extends rural subspecialty care to northeastern New York and the northwest border of New Hampshire. The STROBE checklist for cohort studies was followed (Appendix 1). All research activities were approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Review Board.

2.2 Participant Selection

The study period included ten years (1/01/2014‐12/31/2024) after institutional implementation of the 3VTV. All fetal cardiology referrals during the study period were eligible for inclusion. An institutional fetal echocardiographic database was retrospectively queried for common free text anatomic descriptors of right aortic arches ("right aortic arch", "right sided aortic arch", "right‐sided aortic arch", "right aorta"). Fetal echocardiographic reports and images were reviewed to verify anatomic characteristics and confirm eligibility (JF, CH). Pregnancies with any of the following were excluded: left aortic arch, double aortic arch, right or absent ductus arteriosus, fetal arrhythmias requiring medical therapy, and/or critical congenital heart disease. Fetal echocardiograms that were normal but ordered due to family history of right aortic arch or question of arch sidedness were excluded. Distinct pregnancies with fetal echocardiographic diagnosis of iRAA were then cross‐referenced with a prospective pediatric cardiology quality improvement patient database to assist with maternal‐infant linkage to postnatal outcomes (i.e. eligible pediatric patients).

All eligible pediatric patients were retrospectively reviewed at the conclusion of the study period. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic health record and included as available or until discharge from the collaborative care pathway. Patients without documented postnatal pediatric pulmonology or cardiology clinic visits were excluded from analysis.

### Congenital variants and anomalies of the aortic arch [^1115HvTu]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Congenital variants and anomalies of the aortic arch are important to recognize as they may be associated with vascular rings, congenital heart disease, and chromosomal abnormalities, and can have important implications for prognosis and management. The purpose of this article is to review cross-sectional imaging techniques used in the evaluation of the aortic arch, describe the embryology and anatomy of the aortic arch system, discuss aortic arch variants and anomalies, and review other malformations of the aortic arch, including interrupted aortic arch, hypoplastic aortic arch, and aortic coarctation. Aortic arch variants and anomalies will be reviewed in the context of a theoretical double aortic arch system. Arch anomalies can be associated with symptoms, such as dysphagia lusoria in the setting of left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery. Arch variants that form a vascular ring, such as double aortic arch, can result in respiratory distress due to tracheal compression. Certain arch anomalies are strongly associated with congenital heart disease, including right aortic arch with mirror image branching. Other malformations of the aortic arch have important associations, such as type B interrupted aortic arch, which is associated with a locus 22q11.2 microdeletion. Noninvasive imaging at CT angiography and MR angiography allows for comprehensive evaluation of the aortic arch and branch vessels in relation to surrounding structures. Familiarity with the spectrum and imaging appearances of aortic arch variants, anomalies, and malformations is essential for accurate diagnosis and classification and to guide management.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^113romFe]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over ten years, surgical treatment was recommended for four children (16%) due to progressive aerodigestive symptoms attributed to iRAA vascular ring anatomy, and one child had surgery due to anatomic findings by CT scan. Of note, this patient was referred before the establishment of our institutional collaborative care pathway. Surgeries for children in our pathway were performed between 11 and 14 months of age, and without serious adverse events. Although current surgical interventions are associated with low rates of morbidity, important potential risks remain that are trivial neither to the family nor medical home. Our center followed a cautious approach to surgical referral, considering the complexity of care required to help a child recover from potential recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, chylothorax, or pleural effusion, and the possibility for reoperation.

Given the risks of surgery at a young age for mild symptoms compared to unknown long‐term benefits, we deferred early surgical evaluations for 15 patients who developed aerodigestive symptoms and learned that symptoms were either transient or had no clinically significant effect. If we had followed the pathways of other centers, > 80% of our total may have been referred to a surgical center upon developing initial symptoms — even if mild or transiently resolved — and probably would have had empiric testing, possibly increasing exposure to radiation, anesthesia, invasive procedures, and surgery. Instead, we frequently deferred more complex testing and interventions, and during a short period of time learned that many children demonstrated clinical improvement and ultimately were able to be discharged from subspecialty care.

Right arch management recommendations are largely derived from more urban tertiary and quaternary care center data. In more rural areas without surgical services, additional testing and evaluation may be burdensome as families must travel to more specialized facilities. For our patients, these facilities are located out of state, at distances between 150 and 300 miles (estimated 3–5 h travel) from our pediatric center. Given that our data demonstrated that postnatal aerodigestive symptoms are frequently minor and/or transient, and in the context of our regional resources, a more nuanced approach may be warranted when initially counseling families regarding empiric testing or surgery in rural geographies. However, this approach should be cautiously balanced with the importance of regional and centralized surgical expertise often confined to larger centers, where risks and benefits of symptoms, anatomic variants and vascular position may be balanced in relation to surgical options.

### Cervical aortic arch… [^112QcgrD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Two patients with left cervical aortic arch are presented and are analyzed with the 13 previously reported cases. This anomaly is thought to represent a persistent third embryonic aortic arch with regression of the normal fourth arch. The patient is usually asymptomatic but occasionally has wheezing suggesting a vascular ring. Clues to the diagnosis are a pulsatile mass above either clavicle and blood pressure differences between the arms, with strong femoral pulses. The normal precordial examination contrasts to the loud murmur and thrill over the cervical mass. A chest roentgenogram usually shows an abnormal aorta or high mediastinal shadow, which may be confirmed as a right or left cervical aorta by aortography. No surgical therapy is indicated.

### Influence of fetal diagnosis on management of vascular rings [^112T62gs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal diagnoses of vascular rings have been increasing. We compared management strategies and outcomes of infants with fetal diagnosis with those with postnatal diagnosis to inform recommendations regarding optimal management.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of vascular ring operations from January 2000 to June 2019. Standard demographic data (preoperative clinical status, timing of diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging, operative and perioperative details, and clinical outcomes) were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to compare characteristics and outcomes of fetal versus postnatal diagnosis.

Results

Of 190 patients, 15% (n = 29) were diagnosed prenatally. Anatomic variants were double aortic arch (n = 66, 14 fetal diagnoses), right aortic arch, aberrant left subclavian artery (n = 94, 12 fetal diagnoses), circumflex aorta (n = 7, 1 fetal diagnosis), and pulmonary artery sling (n = 19, 2 fetal diagnoses). An increasing frequency of fetal diagnoses has been noted in the past 10 years. In 2012 1 of 9 patients (11%) had a fetal diagnosis, whereas in 2018 8 of 11 (72%) had a fetal diagnosis (P < .001). Patients with a fetal diagnosis were significantly younger at the time of surgery (13.1 months [interquartile range (IQR), 20.6] vs 24.0 months [IQR, 87.0], P = 0.029). There was no difference in postoperative complications or length of stay (3 days [IQR, 1] for fetal diagnoses vs 4 days [IQR, 3] for postnatal diagnoses, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

Fetal diagnosis leads to the potential for expectant management of vascular ring patients. This has resulted in earlier time of intervention with no increase in postoperative morbidity. This may lead to improved long-term outcomes and potentially alter the natural history for these children.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — definition and associated lesions: Tetralogy of Fallot has 4 components — subpulmonary infundibular stenosis, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an aorta that overrides the VSD by less than 50% of its diameter, and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery anomalies are frequent and include hypoplasia and stenosis; associated anomalies can include a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), and a right aortic arch in approximately 25% of cases. Coronary artery anomalies also occur, most commonly with a left anterior descending artery from the right coronary artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in approximately 3% of cases.

Kommerell's diverticulum — association, imaging, measurement, and size thresholds are described as follows: Variant aortic arch anatomy is associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm/disease, including "33% of patients with right-sided aortic arch having concomitant TAA" and that an aberrant right subclavian artery "occurred in 2% to 8% of those patients"; if an aberrant subclavian artery is detected without thoracic aorta imaging, "a dedicated CT or MRI to evaluate for an associated aortic aneurysm is reasonable". Reported rupture/dissection has occurred for diverticula "ranging from 4.0 cm to 10 cm (mean size, 5.0 cm)". For assessment, "2 diameter measurements should be obtained" on cross-sectional imaging — the "diverticulum orifice" and the "combined diameter of the diverticulum and adjacent descending thoracic aorta" — and repair "has been suggested when the orifice diameter is ≥ 3 cm or the combined diameter of the diverticulum and adjacent descending thoracic aorta is > 5.0 cm". Additional context notes it "may be present in 20% to 60% of patients with an aberrant right or left subclavian artery", with rupture/dissection risk "as high as 50% in case series", and that separate guidelines "recommend surgical intervention… when the diverticulum orifice is > 3.0 cm" or the combined diameter "is > 5.0 cm".

2.3 Collaborative Care Pathway

Given the uncertainty regarding optimal care for this group of patients, variable clinical approach, and absence of evidence‐based guidelines, a new institutional collaborative care pathway was developed in 2016 by our pediatric cardiology and pulmonology teams (Figure 1) to standardize pre and postnatal care follow up, reduce testing variability, and improve communication with patients and families, their medical home, and subspecialists. The clinical pathway focused on iRAA care following prenatal diagnosis confirmed by fetal echocardiogram and offered initial joint postnatal evaluation by both services. A transthoracic echocardiogram was completed at the first postnatal visit to confirm cardiac anatomy. Clinical follow up and testing was primarily determined by the presence of aerodigestive signs and/or symptoms.

Figure 1
Collaborative cardiopulmonary care pathway for isolated right aortic arch diagnoses confirmed by fetal echocardiogram. Postnatal clinical evaluation frequency is determined by presence (+) or absence of aerodigestive signs and/or symptoms. Additional clinical testing is based on the primary aerodigestive symptom(s), with surgical evaluation considered for progressive findings attributed to the vascular ring anatomy.

Evaluations focused on both the context and evolution of symptoms including association with upper respiratory infections, presence at baseline, during sleep and/or with feeding, and progression upon advancement to solid foods. All patients were monitored for growth, development, advancing diet, and respiratory symptoms associated with positional changes. An esophagram was considered to evaluate primary feeding symptoms. Contrast chest computed tomography and bronchoscopy were considered for primary respiratory symptoms. Surgical evaluation was considered if symptom progression was primarily attributed to the vascular anatomy. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients were offered anticipatory guidance and shared decision making to support additional follow up either by the pulmonary service or primary medical home.

3 Results

A total of 3,458 fetal echocardiograms were performed on 2,444 distinct patients during the study period (Figure 2). Sixty‐four right arch fetal cases were identified, and 31 met iRAA inclusion criteria. Cases were excluded for complex congenital heart disease (14), repeat studies (13), sidedness clarified to be normal (5), and a right sided ductus arteriosus (1). At the conclusion of the study period, three patients were not yet born, and three did not have any postnatal subspeciality evaluation.

A final study cohort of 25 iRAA infants were included for analysis (Table 2). Twenty patients (80%) were medically managed and 5 (20%) were referred for surgery. Median birth weight for medically managed patients was 3,129 grams (including two premature infants) and 3,430 grams for patients referred for surgery. APGARs were normal for both groups. Infants were initially evaluated at median ages of 6 weeks (medical management) or 7 weeks (surgical). First additional testing due to symptoms occurred at a median age of 7.5 months (medical) or 8 months (surgical). Median study follow‐up time was 14 (11.5, 17.5) months in the medical group and 36 (18, 37) months in the surgical group.

ACC/AHA 2022 aortic disease — Aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA): An ASCA is commonly an incidental finding but may present with compressive symptoms (including dysphagia and dyspnea) because it courses posterior to the esophagus and trachea and may associate with aneurysm disease. A normal left aortic arch with a right ASCA occurs in ∼ 1% of the population, whereas a right aortic arch with a left ASCA is much rarer and may form a vascular ring. Dilatation of the origin of either a right or left ASCA occurs in 20% to 60% of cases and is known as a Kommerell diverticulum, which may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or embolization.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^113QZerL]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

Most prenatally diagnosed iRAA children in our cohort did not develop progressive aerodigestive symptoms within their first 2 years of life. Infants more commonly were asymptomatic or had resolution of symptoms and could be managed medically. The presence of isolated digestive symptoms or in combination with respiratory symptoms may prompt greater clinical concern for earlier cross‐section imaging and surgical evaluation. Despite aerodigestive symptoms in the cohort majority, infant weight profiles did not appear to be adversely affected. Standardized postnatal aerodigestive evaluation may assist clinicians with short‐term iRAA risk stratification. Our cardiopulmonary collaborative care pathway offers one symptom‐based framework and supports clinicians to be more judicious about ancillary testing when managing these children in smaller rural and nonsurgical settings.

### Right aortic arch diagnosed antenatally: associations and outcome in 98 fetuses [^114nyNXM]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyse the main characteristics, associated conditions and outcome of right aortic arch (RAA) detected in fetal life, and to assess if further investigation is required in cases of isolated RAA.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of all fetuses diagnosed with a RAA between 2004 and 2012 at a tertiary centre for fetal cardiology.

Results

A RAA was identified in 98 fetuses: 27 had normal intracardiac anatomy and 71 were associated with other congenital heart disease (CHD); conotruncal anomalies being the most common. An aberrant left subclavian artery was diagnosed in 18.4% of cases, a double aortic arch in 6.1%, and 12.2% had a vascular ring confirmed after birth. Overall, an extracardiac anomaly was present in 31.6% of the patients and a chromosomal anomaly in 15.3%, with half of the latter cases being 22q11.2 microdeletion. Extracardiac and chromosomal anomalies were more commonly associated with RAA with structural CHD (39.4% and 19.7%, respectively), compared to cases of RAA with normal intracardiac anatomy (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively) (p < 0.05). First year mortality was 10.3%, with all deaths being in cases with associated structural CHD.

Conclusions

Detailed fetal extracardiac examination should be undertaken in all cases of RAA. Isolated RAA has a good prognosis, and in the majority of the patients it is an asymptomatic vascular variant with a relatively low risk for chromosomal anomaly. The prognosis of RAA with CHD depends on the complexity of the CHD and/or the associated extracardiac anomalies. In these cases, there is a higher risk for chromosomal anomaly, particularly 22q11.2 microdeletion.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^116cJ16p]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although prenatal imaging advancements have increased isolated right aortic arch (iRAA) detection, optimal postnatal vascular ring management remains uncertain. Whereas early postnatal imaging and surgical management may be clinically warranted for some infants, long-term data are not yet available to justify an identical approach for all prenatal iRAA diagnoses.

Methods

Children with prenatally diagnosed iRAA and left ductus arteriosus were included in a retrospective cohort study at a rural academic center. Fetal echocardiograms (2014–2024) were reviewed to exclude complex congenital heart disease. Joint postnatal cardiopulmonary care was standardized. Clinical data were ascertained using aerodigestive symptom checklists. Fisher's exact test was used to examine associations between symptoms and surgical referral. Growth was assessed by z-score rates of change from birth weight until last clinic weight.

Results

3,458 fetal echocardiograms were performed yielding 31 distinct cases meeting inclusion criteria, with postnatal data available for 25. Twenty were managed medically (25% asymptomatic, 75% intermittently symptomatic) with median follow up of 14 (11.5, 17.5) months; five underwent surgery (80% progressively symptomatic) with median follow up of 36 (18, 37) months). Choking/dysphagia (p = 0.04), recurrent emesis (p = 0.03), and the combination of both digestive symptoms and noisy breathing (p = 0.01) were associated with surgical referral. Weight outcomes were similar (p = 0.98) between medical and surgical patients.

Conclusions

Although aerodigestive symptoms were common, most were not progressive and weight profiles were not adversely affected. Isolated digestive symptoms or in combination with respiratory symptoms may prompt greater concern. A collaborative cardiopulmonary approach to clinical evaluation may help with short-term risk stratification.

Interrupted right aortic arch is a rare congenital cardiovascular anomaly typically associated with other forms of congenital heart disease. We report two cases of interrupted right aortic arch associated with isolated left pulmonary artery and bilateral ductus arteriosus in the first case and with truncus arteriosus in the second case. Computed tomography was complementary to echocardiography in delineating the anatomic details in both cases, informing surgical repair with reconstruction of a left aortic arch in the first case and right arch in the second case.

Bovine aortic arch in neonatal and infant coarctation — prevalence, recurrence risk, and operative considerations are described as follows: Reported prevalence varies, with "a 3% to 5% prevalence of bovine arch anatomy" in some cohorts, while "imaging and autopsy analysis… reveal bovine arch frequencies of 15% to 37%". Echocardiography report review "only identified 6.1%" versus image re-reads showing "a 28.6% prevalence". In the same cohort, recurrence "as defined by a gradient of > 20 mm Hg" occurred in "28.6%… compared with 5.6% in those who had anatomoses". Anatomical constraints may affect repair because "bovine arches are shorter and could limit clamping", and clamp placement "has potential to significantly impair cerebral blood flow". Given a potential increased propensity for recoarctation, "consideration can be made for repair through a sternotomy", noting the absence of comparative approach data in this subgroup.

Infants can present clinically in the early neonatal period, when the ductus closes, with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and systemic hypoperfusion. Newborn screening via pulse oximetry can lead to earlier diagnosis. Postnatal. Clinical and epidemiologic notes As noted, an early presentation is heart failure and cardiogenic shock, with rapid clinical deterioration as the ductus closes. Because of right-to-left shunting at the ductus arteriosus, infants might initially show differential oxygen saturation or cyanosis. In type A, the difference in saturation is between the upper and lower limbs, with the lower limbs having lower saturation; in type B, there is a difference in saturation between the left and right arms, with the left arm having lower saturation. Ventricular septal defect and other intracardiac defects are often present. The three types of IAA differ in their association with genetic risk factors.

For example, deletion 22q11 occurs in 50% or more of cases of type B IAA, and is rare in the other types. Other syndromes that can occur with IAA include CHARGE syndrome.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^112Nsfn6]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Patient characteristics following prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch.

Of the entire cohort, 13 (52%) total children were asymptomatic by 18 months without surgery. Within the medical group, five patients (25%) remained entirely asymptomatic throughout their postnatal clinical observation while 15 patients (75%) experienced at least one aerodigestive symptom. Of these 15 patients, 10 (66%) became asymptomatic: 8 patients became asymptomatic by 15 months, and an additional two patients became consistently asymptomatic by 24 months. At the end of the study period, aerodigestive symptoms for five patients were either attributed to causes other than a vascular ring or determined to be too mild to warrant surgical referral.

Of the entire cohort, symptoms in six (24%) infants were progressive or severe enough to warrant further investigations with radiographic studies and/or bronchoscopy. Two symptomatic infants (8%) had upper airway or digestive difficulties that were determined to be unrelated to their vascular anatomy. Four infants (16%) were referred for surgery based on severity of symptoms and anatomical factors, (e.g. severe tracheal or esophageal narrowing), that correlated with additional testing, with median age at surgery of 12 months. One child (4%) had surgery due to anatomic findings by CT scan at 2 months of age before any symptom development; this clinical decision was determined to be based on a physician practice preference and was made before the development of the clinical care pathway. Therefore, of the entire prenatal cohort of 25 patients, five (20%) were determined to be asymptomatic and without surgical intervention following prenatal diagnosis through 18 months. An additional 15 patients (60%) were medically managed through mild symptoms, typically intermittent, resolving, and/or attributable to other primary causes.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^113fJmcq]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study addresses the rapid evolution of prenatal diagnostic imaging both in obstetrics and fetal cardiology, which over the past decade has altered the natural history of right arch presentation. Before expanding the cardiac assessment to include the 3VTV, the majority of iRAA diagnoses were likely postnatal, either incidental findings or in the setting of progressive aerodigestive symptoms. Ideally, prenatal testing will continue to evolve, offering more precise anatomic predictors of postnatal symptom severity; yet in the absence of additional congenital heart disease, overall risk stratification is far from perfect. Advancements in prenatal imaging also introduce clinical uncertainty at a far earlier stage — the developing fetus — and may adversely affect parental mental health. Even if lower risk anatomic variation is suspected, congenital findings are more likely to increase diagnostic testing and parental stress during the pregnancy and early childhood years. Our study also demonstrates that nearly 70% (31/45) of right arches in our fetal practice were in the absence of other congenital heart disease, supporting the need for iRAA counseling during pregnancy and updating natural history outcomes relevant to this specific diagnostic context. As fetal diagnosis of iRAA increases, our study offers a collaborative pathway that may support clinicians in accurate and consistent prenatal care counseling, delivery planning, and postnatal care, potentially helping to mitigate parental stress.

### Differentiating closely resembling fetal aortic arch abnormalities using conventional and four-dimensional echocardiography: a pictorial essay with postnatal outcomes [^112kdaEi]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Double aortic arch with an atretic left aortic arch can resemble like a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery or a right aortic arch with mirror image branching. Differentiating these closely resembling fetal aortic arch abnormalities is important for proper prenatal counselling and immediate neonatal evaluation. In this pictorial essay, we describe these three cases and its typical imaging features using conventional and four-dimensional echocardiography.

### Prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch: a collaborative approach to management of postnatal aerodigestive symptoms [^114bQibF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prenatal imaging standards have evolved over the past decade to include anatomic evaluation of aortic arch sidedness, increasing the fetal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch (iRAA). In 2013 the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended including the three‐vessel trachea view (3VTV) during the 20‐week anatomy scan, further supported in 2018 by national practice guidelines. Our institution began including the 3VTV in routine prenatal ultrasounds in 2014, which subsequently increased iRAA fetal diagnostic rates and prompted questions about postnatal management.

Anatomic variants of iRAA with left ductus arteriosus may serve as substrate for a vascular ring by encircling the trachea and esophagus. Although the developing fetus is asymptomatic, postnatally some infants may present with progressive aerodigestive symptoms, often during the first few months of life. Symptoms due to tracheoesophageal compression may require additional clinical investigation, testing, and multidisciplinary care. While more progressive and severe symptoms likely necessitate vascular ring surgery, some centers may still recommend empiric testing and surgical management for all prenatally diagnosed children, even those with absent or milder symptoms. Although current era studies frequently report operative outcomes, much less is known regarding the clinical course of prenatally diagnosed iRAA infants in rural areas who are managed more conservatively.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate postnatal aerodigestive symptoms in infants and toddlers with primary fetal diagnosis of iRAA. We focused on the clinical course and short‐term outcomes of patients managed by a collaborative institutional care pathway. The primary aim was to determine the percentage of prenatally diagnosed iRAA patients who were asymptomatic without surgical intervention by 18 months of age. Additionally, we sought to categorize aerodigestive symptom patterns, assess patient growth, and share our collaborative care approach.

### Surgical management of circumflex aorta associated with coarctation and tracheoesophageal fistula [^111M43ZW]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A newborn baby, born at full term weighing 3.1 kg, with prenatal diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, right aortic arch, and polyhydramnios was noted to have respiratory distress at birth. Postnatal course was complicated by difficulty in passing a nasogastric tube, raising suspicion for esophageal atresia. A computed tomography scan confirmed the diagnoses of right CA with an aberrant left subclavian artery and type C TEF (Figure 1). Mild-to-moderate narrowing of the trachea was also noted. Echocardiogram confirmed right aortic arch with mild coarctation of the aorta (peak gradient of 20 mm Hg) in the setting of a large ductus.

Computed tomography images showing the circumflex aorta and its relationship to the airway and esophagus.

The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which demonstrated a fistulous connection of the distal trachea with the distal esophageal segment. Following a multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a right thoracotomy through the fourth intercostal space on day 2 of life. The distal esophagus was isolated and the fistulous connection to the distal trachea was divided. The proximal esophageal pouch was located behind the superior vena cava above the transverse aortic arch. Given the considerable gap between the esophageal segments and the imminent need for cardiac intervention, a decision was made to leave the upper pouch alone and perform a gastrostomy. Despite continuous evacuation of the proximal esophageal pouch, the patient could not be weaned off noninvasive mechanical ventilation due to recurrent collapse of the right lung, indicating significant airway compression from the vascular ring. In addition, a repeat echocardiogram following cessation of prostaglandin demonstrated significant narrowing of the distal arch and the isthmus (peak gradient of 79 mm Hg).

Coronary anomalies — considerations and scope for Table 13 define included lesions and exclusions, typical management, and follow-up basis. Congenital coronary anomalies include abnormal origin of a coronary artery from the PA, anomalous aortic origin from a different aortic sinus of Valsalva, coronary arteriovenous fistula, and coronary artery ostial atresia, and a coronary artery anomaly in the setting of other CHDs or isolated abnormalities in coronary artery branching (without an interarterial course) are not included. Patients with anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the PA, anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva, and coronary artery ostial atresia almost always undergo surgical repair shortly after diagnosis, and AUC scenarios after these diagnoses are not included. The literature regarding anomalous aortic origin and sudden death remains limited to observational studies, the decision to pursue intervention or observation is beyond the scope of this document, and recommendations for follow-up after intervention are based on expert consensus opinion and the best available evidence. Interventions for abnormal origin include reimplantation, bypass graft, Takeuchi repair, unroofing of an intramural segment, coronary artery translocation, and PA translocation, while interventions for coronary arteriovenous fistulae include transcatheter coil or device occlusion and surgical ligation.

### Bovine aortic arch: a potential indicator that may not serve in prenatal diagnosis-a study based on fetal anatomy, genetics, and postnatal clinical outcomes [^114NJcut]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study underscores that the majority of BAA fetuses exist in isolation, with only a minority presenting concurrent cardiac and extra-cardiac structural abnormalities. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is notably low, and overall postnatal clinical outcomes tend to be favorable. Consequently, the clinical utility of obtaining the long-axis view of the aortic arch for diagnosing isolated BAA during antenatal ultrasound screening appears limited. For low-risk populations, invasive antenatal diagnosis is not recommended. However, for fetuses exhibiting concurrent structural abnormalities or those at risk of chromosomal abnormalities, continued vigilance and provision of appropriate genetic counseling and management remain imperative.

### Prenatal sonographic features of a double aortic arch: literature review and perinatal management [^112Ag19M]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A double aortic arch is a relatively uncommon anomaly occasionally associated with congenital heart disease or the chromosome 22q11 deletion. We report a case of prenatal diagnosis of a double aortic arch in which the sonographic features in the 3-vessel and trachea view are highlighted. A PubMed-based search was made to retrieve all cases of prenatal diagnosis of double aortic arch. A total of 13 articles and 35 cases were found. The average gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks. Six cases had associated cardiac anomalies. Only 1 case had the 22q11 deletion, showing extracardiac anomalies without cardiac defect. The postnatal evolution was characterized by symptoms of tracheoesophageal compression in 72.4% of the cases. Detection of a double aortic arch should be followed by a thorough fetal scan and echocardiography, and a chromosomal study should be considered when the sonographic findings are consistent with the 22q11 deletion.
