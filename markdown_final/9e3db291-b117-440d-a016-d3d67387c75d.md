## Question

which hormone causes endometrial hyperplasia / preps for implantation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which hormone causes endometrial hyperplasia and which hormone prepares the endometrium for implantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinct physiologic roles of estrogen versus progesterone on the endometrium. Then, I should verify the evidence linking unopposed estrogen to hyperplasia and cancer risk. Next, I will examine how progesterone transforms the endometrium and supports implantation. Finally, I should reconcile any apparent contradictions and synthesize a clear answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiology. Estrogen drives proliferation of the endometrium, whereas progesterone, in the presence of adequate estrogen, transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation; this foundational framework is consistently described in FDA labeling and mechanistic summaries.

> Now, I will examine which hormone causes endometrial hyperplasia. Unopposed estrogen is well established to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, with risk rising with dose and duration; multiple FDA labels and guidelines emphasize that adding a progestogen to systemic estrogen therapy reduces hyperplasia risk, underscoring estrogen's causal role in driving proliferation when not opposed by progesterone [^113JZtb2] [^112RtwQk] [^115cD26z] [^113ba98y].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical implications. Randomized data show dramatically higher hyperplasia rates with estrogen alone versus estrogen plus progesterone; for example, in a 36‑month trial, hyperplasia occurred in 64% with conjugated estrogens alone versus 6% with conjugated estrogens plus progesterone, and guideline statements consistently recommend adding progestogen to systemic estrogen in women with a uterus to mitigate this risk [^117KnvAG] [^113ba98y] [^113SUj3L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about implantation. I initially thought estrogen might be the primary hormone for implantation readiness, but I should double-check that. The correct answer is that progesterone is the hormone that prepares the endometrium for implantation by inducing secretory transformation and enhancing receptivity; progesterone supplementation is indicated in ART to support implantation and early pregnancy, which directly addresses the implantation question [^115MrT5G] [^113GQHq1] [^112pNVQi] [^111vHLJr].

> Let me consider the clinical context to ensure coherence. In anovulatory states like PCOS, chronic unopposed estrogen exposure elevates hyperplasia risk, and management includes cycle regulation and progestogen therapy to counter estrogen's proliferative effects; conversely, in luteal phase deficiency, supplemental progesterone is used to improve endometrial maturation and receptivity, aligning with progesterone's role in implantation support rather than estrogen's proliferative role [^117NEPPn] [^117QAgsu].

> I should confirm there are no major contradictions. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the likelihood of implantation by altering the endometrium, but that effect reflects combined estrogen–progestin modulation and is not equivalent to the specific secretory preparation required for successful implantation; thus, this does not contradict progesterone's primacy for implantation readiness in a natural or supplemented luteal phase [^114YCwv5] [^115MrT5G].

> Synthesis: Estrogen causes endometrial hyperplasia when exposure is unopposed, whereas progesterone prepares the endometrium for implantation by transforming it into a secretory state and enhancing receptivity; clinically, this is why progestogen is added to systemic estrogen in women with a uterus and why progesterone is used to support implantation in ART [^113JZtb2] [^113ba98y] [^115MrT5G] [^112pNVQi].

Estrogen drives endometrial hyperplasia by promoting proliferation, whereas **progesterone prepares the endometrium for implantation** by converting it to a secretory state and increasing receptivity [^113JZtb2] [^115MrT5G]. Unopposed estrogen raises the risk of hyperplasia and cancer, so **progesterone is required to oppose estrogen** and stabilize the endometrium for implantation [^113JZtb2] [^113ba98y].

---

## Estrogen and endometrial hyperplasia

Estrogen stimulates endometrial proliferation; **chronic unopposed estrogen** can cause hyperplasia and cancer [^113ba98y]. Risk is higher with obesity, PCOS, and exogenous estrogen without progestogen [^113ym2yc] [^117NEPPn] [^113JZtb2].

---

## Progesterone and endometrial preparation for implantation

Progesterone transforms the proliferative endometrium into a secretory one, **increasing receptivity for implantation** [^115MrT5G]. It also stabilizes the endometrium and supports early pregnancy [^113GQHq1].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic considerations

- **Unopposed estrogen**: Increases hyperplasia/cancer risk; progesterone must be added in women with a uterus [^113ba98y] [^113SUj3L].
- **Progesterone supplementation**: Used in ART to support implantation and early pregnancy [^112pNVQi] [^111vHLJr].
- **Hormone therapy**: Combined estrogen–progestogen regimens reduce hyperplasia risk and support endometrial stability [^111waK4C] [^113JZtb2].

---

Estrogen promotes proliferation and can cause hyperplasia, whereas **progesterone prepares the endometrium for implantation** and stabilizes it; **progesterone is essential to oppose estrogen** and enable successful implantation [^112MhkXo] [^115MrT5G] [^113ba98y].

Endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer — patients who are receiving or have received tamoxifen and who retain their uterus should undergo annual gynecologic exams. Any change in menstrual bleeding and any postmenopausal vaginal bleeding should prompt a gynecologic evaluation, uterine ultrasound, and possible endometrial biopsy. In the absence of bleeding change or abnormalities, there is no role for routine ultrasound or endometrial biopsies to monitor the endometrium.

Vaginal estradiol tablets — endometrial monitoring considerations: Estradiol tablets, when placed in the upper third of the vagina, may result in a uterine first-pass effect resulting in a higher degree of uterine stimulation. It is unknown whether endometrial proliferation, hyperplasia, or cancer can occur after long-duration treatment (> 1 y) or in women with risk factors (late menopause, higher body mass index, higher dosing). For women at higher risk of endometrial cancer, surveillance using transvaginal ultrasound, followed by endometrial biopsy if endometrial thickening is present, may be prudent. Intermittent (possibly annual) progestogen withdrawal may be considered to assess endometrial status.

Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial hyperplasia (a possible precursor of endometrial cancer) has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with BIJUVA (estradiol and progesterone) capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg or 1 mg/100 mg.

An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with an increased risk of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.

Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology.

There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115sA7UY]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Key points for systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen‑progestogen therapy (EPT) — the appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals that provides benefits and minimizes risks for the individual woman should be the therapeutic goal; formulation, dose, and route of administration for hormone therapy should be determined individually and reassessed periodically; different hormone therapy doses, formulations, and routes of administration may have different effects on target organs, potentially allowing options to minimize risk; the appropriate formulation, dose, and route of administration of progestogen is needed to counter the proliferative effects of systemic estrogen on the endometrium; overall, the increased absolute risks associated with oral ET and EPT are rare (< 10/10,000/y) and include increased risk for VTE and gallbladder disease, and EPT carries a rare increased risk for stroke and breast cancer and, if estrogen is inadequately opposed, an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer; the absolute risks are reduced for all-cause mortality, fracture, diabetes mellitus (EPT and ET), and breast cancer (ET) in women younger than 60 years.

### Progesterone (Crinone) [^115MrT5G]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid that is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue, and the effect of progesterone on the differentiation of glandular epithelia and stroma has been extensively studied. Progesterone is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy. Normal or near-normal endometrial responses to oral estradiol and intramuscular progesterone have been noted in functionally agonadal women through the sixth decade of life. Progesterone administration decreases the circulatory levels of gonadotropins.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113ba98y]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer — systemic estrogen therapy risks and progestogen use are summarized as follows: unopposed systemic ET in a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus increases the risk of endometrial cancer and is dose- and duration-related; progestogen used continuously or cyclically for 10 to 14 days monthly significantly reduces this risk, and adequate concomitant progestogen is recommended for a woman with an intact uterus when using systemic ET; low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endometrial cancer risk, although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration; progestogen is not advised with low-dose vaginal ET for GSM, although intermittent use may be considered in women at increased risk; and postmenopausal bleeding must be evaluated thoroughly because it may signal endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^115FAsux]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Secondary Amenorrhea

Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy.

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology

Beginning on the calculated 16thor 21stday of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16thday of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate.

Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1stday of the cycle or the 16thday of the cycle.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Progesterone Capsules (proe-JES-ter-own)

Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start taking progesterone capsules and read what you get each time you refill your progesterone capsules prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PEANUT OIL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS.

What is progesterone capsules?

Progesterone capsules contain the female hormone called progesterone.

What is progesterone capsules used for?

Treatment of Menstrual Irregularities

Progesterone capsules are used for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods in women who have previously had a menstrual period) due to a decrease in progesterone. When you do not produce enough progesterone, menstrual irregularities can occur. If your healthcare provider has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own, progesterone capsules may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need.

Protection of the Endometrium (Lining of the Uterus)

Progesterone capsules are used in combination with estrogen-containing medications in a postmenopausal woman with a uterus (womb). Taking estrogen-alone increases the chance of developing a condition called endometrial hyperplasia that may lead to cancer of the lining of the uterus (womb). The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for a woman with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb).

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111waK4C]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Estrogen–progestogen therapy (EPT) and endometrial safety — When adequate progestogen is combined with systemic estrogen, the risk of endometrial neoplasia is not higher than in untreated women, and in the WHI continuous oral CEE plus MPA showed endometrial cancer risk similar to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–1.36) with significant reduction after a median 13 years' cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49–0.91). A meta-analysis suggested increased risk of endometrial cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.2) with noncontinuous combined EPT but not with continuous EPT. For prevention of endometrial hyperplasia, oral MP should be adequately dosed (eg, 200 mg/d for 12–14 d/mo), and off-label use of a levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device may avoid adverse systemic effects and can protect against unwanted pregnancy, although there are limited clinical trial data to support this use. In women using EPT, unscheduled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiation should be investigated.

Effects on the endometrium

In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 358 postmenopausal women, each with an intact uterus, received treatment for up to 36 months. The treatment groups were: Progesterone capsules at the dose of 200 mg per day for 12 days per 28-day cycle in combination with conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day (n = 120); conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day only (n = 119); or placebo (n = 119). The subjects in all three treatment groups were primarily Caucasian women (87 percent or more of each group). The results for the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in women receiving up to 3 years of treatment are shown in Table 3. A comparison of the progesterone capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group to the conjugated estrogens only group showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia (6 percent combination product versus 64 percent estrogen alone) in the progesterone capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group throughout 36 months of treatment.

The times to diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia over 36 months of treatment are shown in Figure 1. This figure illustrates graphically that the proportion of patients with hyperplasia was significantly greater for the conjugated estrogens group (64 percent) compared to the conjugated estrogens plus progesterone capsules group (6 percent).

Figure 1. Time to Hyperplasia in Women Receiving up to 36 Months of Treatment

The discontinuation rates due to hyperplasia over the 36 months of treatment are as shown in Table 4. For any degree of hyperplasia, the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens plus progesterone capsules was similar to that of the placebo only group, while the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens alone was significantly higher. Women who permanently discontinued treatment due to hyperplasia were similar in demographics to the overall study population.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^116xGZP5]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Endometrial biopsy — abnormalities of endometrial maturation have been viewed historically as the gold standard to diagnose LPD, and studies that have defined the diagnostic criteria for LPD using endometrial biopsy have relied on the traditional microscopic appearance of luteal phase endometrial development. However, implantation is associated with changes in a number of factors beyond endometrial histology, maturation may differ across various sections of the endometrium and a single endometrial biopsy may not be able to assess global endometrial development, and defining clinically applicable criteria for normal luteal phase endometrial development is complex and evolving.

Progestogen coadministration and endometrial protection — Progestogens commonly coadministered with estrogen in women with a uterus include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), norethindrone acetate (NETA), and micronized progesterone (MP). Chronic unopposed endometrial exposure to estrogen increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, and women with an intact uterus using systemic estrogen therapy (ET) should receive adequate progestogen unless they are taking CEE combined with bazedoxifene (BZA).

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Combined Oral Contraceptives

Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).

Endometrial effects with androgen therapy — In a retrospective review of postmenopausal women receiving combined estrogen and T via pellets, endometrial monitoring found an endometrial thickness > 5 mm in 44 of 258 women at 2 years, and 20.4% had simple hyperplasia; in such combined treatment settings, concurrent continuous or cyclic progestin therapy is essential for nonhysterectomized women; in APHRODITE, ultrasound at baseline and 12-month endometrial biopsies showed no differences in endometrial findings across treatments, but endometrial bleeding occurred more frequently on the 300 μg/d TTP dose (10.6%) compared with 150 μg/d (2.7%) or placebo (2.6%); biopsies revealed endometrial atrophy in the woman with bleeding on the 300 μg/d dose, and more women on the higher TTP dose had a 12-month biopsy read as insufficient tissue for diagnosis, consistent with T without concomitant estrogen promoting endometrial atrophy.

Treatment — hormone replacement approaches: Treatment of hypogonadism seeks to normalize ovarian hormone levels; estrogen may be replaced with oral, micronized, or transdermal preparations, and progesterone therapy is also needed to avoid an unopposed estrogen effect and maintain endometrial health in women with a uterus. Oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices provide a variety of estrogen and progesterone forms and dosing options. Ovarian hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens differ for survivors who were prepubertal before cancer therapy and those who experience gonadal failure after menarche.

Breast Cancer

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Only daily oral 0.625 mg CE and 2.5 mg MPA were studied in the estrogen plus progestin substudy of the WHI. Therefore, the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events, dementia and breast cancer to lower CE plus other MPA doses, other routes of administration, or other estrogen plus progestogen products is not known. Without such data, it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products. Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestogen therapy, taking into account her individual risk profile.

Prescribe estrogens with or without progestogens at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

Estrogen-Alone Therapy

Endometrial Cancer

There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Proposed treatments — given the lack of clear diagnostic criteria for LPD and overlapping results between fertile and infertile women, quality data are lacking on treating LPD; the first approach is correction of underlying conditions, and if no underlying abnormality is identified, treatment becomes empiric and is not generally recommended; empiric treatment has aimed to improve ovulatory function, promote endometrial maturation, enhance endometrial receptivity, and support implantation and early pregnancy, using strategies such as supplemental luteal progesterone, luteal progesterone plus estrogen, luteal hCG, or ovarian stimulation with clomiphene or gonadotropins.

Contraceptive implant — mechanisms and rationale for managing irregular bleeding describe that irregular bleeding might be caused by mechanisms including an atrophic endometrium, dysregulated angiogenesis, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, or increased expression of prostaglandin metabolites; multiple treatments have been evaluated with different proposed mechanisms and likely different effects; and NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin levels and might reduce menstrual blood loss.

14.2 Effects on
Endometrium in Postmenopausal Women

Effects of estradiol and progesterone capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg and 1 mg/100 mg, on endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial malignancy were assessed in the 52-week safety trial. The Endometrial Safety population included women who had taken at least one dose of estradiol and progesterone capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg or 1 mg/100 mg, and had baseline and post-baseline endometrial biopsies. During the trial, endometrial biopsy assessments revealed one (1) case of endometrial hyperplasia and no cases of endometrial cancer in women who received estradiol and progesterone capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg, one (1) case of endometrial hyperplasia and no cases of endometrial cancer in women who received estradiol and progesterone capsules, 1 mg/100 mg and no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer in women who received placebo (see Table 5).

Six (6) cases of disordered proliferative endometrium were reported for estradiol and progesterone capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg, and four (4) cases of disordered proliferative endometrium were also reported for estradiol and progesterone capsules, 1 mg/100 mg, in the 52-week safety trial.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^111abgxT]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) pathophysiology — mechanisms and progesterone thresholds — has been described as insufficient ovarian hormone quantity or duration impairing a functional secretory endometrium, with short luteal phase associations to follicular-phase gonadotropin abnormalities and uncertain idiopathic infertility causation. A short luteal phase has been associated with low follicular phase follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, low follicular phase estradiol levels, altered follicular phase FSH/LH ratios, and abnormal FSH and LH pulsatility. Idiopathic LPD implies an abnormality of the luteal phase in the absence of an identifiable disease process, and idiopathic LPD has not been proven to cause infertility. Modeled cycles with exogenous estradiol and progesterone suggest threshold serum progesterone levels for normal endometrial histology may be as low as 2.5 ng/mL, while normal gene expression may require a peak threshold between 8 and 18 ng/mL. With progesterone resistance, the endometrial response to the steroid rather than the amount or duration of exposure is defective.

Dosing of systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and progestogen — The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals, and the appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endometrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose, and different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associations with health outcomes; patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regimens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.

### Conjugated estrogens (Premarin) [^115cD26z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometrial Cancer

An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.

Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

In a 52-week clinical trial using PREMARIN vaginal cream alone (0.5 g inserted twice weekly or daily for 21 days, then off for 7 days), there was no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma.

It is recommended that clinicians and researchers wait at least 3 months after surgery to assess endocrine status, as pelvic surgeries may transiently raise FSH levels; in most cases staging will be limited to classifying premenopausal or postmenopausal status. A single sample for FSH and estradiol may be ambiguous or misleading, and at least one repeated measurement is often required.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to > 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Progesterone (Endometrin) [^113GQHq1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid that is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. Progesterone is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone acts to maintain a pregnancy.

12.3	 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Progesterone serum concentrations increased following the administration of the ENDOMETRIN Vaginal Insert in 12 healthy pre-menopausal females. On single dosing, the mean Cmaxwas 17.0 ng/mL in the ENDOMETRIN twice daily group and 19.8 ng/mL in the ENDOMETRIN three times daily group. On multiple dosing, steady-state concentrations were attained within approximately 1 day after initiation of treatment with ENDOMETRIN. Both ENDOMETRIN regimens provided average serum concentrations of progesterone exceeding 10 ng/mL on Day 5. The pharmacokinetic results are summarized in Table 2.

Distribution

Progesterone is approximately 96% to 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin and corticosteroid binding globulin.

Metabolism

Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver, largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones. Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites. Progesterone metabolites that are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the gut via reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization.

Excretion

Progesterone undergoes renal and biliary elimination. Following injection of labeled progesterone, 50–60% of the excretion of metabolites occurs via the kidney; approximately 10% occurs via the bile and feces. Overall recovery of the labeled material accounts for 70% of an administered dose. Only a small portion of unchanged progesterone is excreted in the bile.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^1127VDXW]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Normal luteal physiology — A typical luteal phase length is relatively fixed at 12–14 days but may range from 11–17 days, and progesterone levels peak in nonpregnancy cycles 6–8 days after ovulation. Progesterone is secreted in pulses under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels may fluctuate up to eightfold within 90 minutes. Once implantation occurs, progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum depends on rising human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels, and failure of hCG levels to increase results directly in corpus luteum failure and a decline in progesterone levels.

---

### Estradiol (estring) [^116Fa8A8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.	Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.

2.	Elevated blood pressure

In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.

3.	Hypertriglyceridemia

In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.

4.	Hepatic impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice

Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.

5.	Hypothyroidism

Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.

6.	Hypocalcemia

Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.

7.	Fluid retention

Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed.

8.	Exacerbation of endometriosis

A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.

### Estradiol [^113BJ43N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important (see PRECAUTIONS). Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

b. Breast cancer

The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of CE/MPA (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration.

The CE/MPA substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took CE/MPA for a mean follow-up of 5.6 years. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk for estrogen/progestin combination therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment. In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen/progestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy.

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.

B. Patient Information

General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts.

Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe PROMETRIUM Capsules.

C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy:

Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests.
Coagulation tests: increase in prothrombin factors VII, VIII, IX and X.
Pregnanediol determination.
Thyroid function: increase in PBI, and butanol extractable protein bound iodine and decrease in T3 uptake values.

D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, long-term intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen.

Progesterone did not show evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro studies for point mutations or for chromosomal damage. In vivo studies for chromosome damage have yielded positive results in mice at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. Exogenously administered progesterone has been shown to inhibit ovulation in a number of species and it is expected that high doses given for an extended duration would impair fertility until the cessation of treatment.

### Estradiol and progesterone [^112MhkXo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Endogenous progesterone is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium.

Progesterone enhances cellular differentiation and generally opposes the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progesterone exerts its effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol and progesterone capsules nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 3.24), but it was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7

A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.

### Estradiol and norethindrone acetate (etyqa) [^112xCN2z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology.

There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

Endometrial hyperplasia occured at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with Etyqa in a clinical trial.

### Medroxyprogesterone [^114sdmHX]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration.

The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

b. Endometrial Cancer

An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.

Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.

Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors, and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, long-term intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen.

Progesterone did not show evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro studies for point mutations or for chromosomal damage. In vivo studies for chromosome damage have yielded positive results in mice at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. Exogenously administered progesterone has been shown to inhibit ovulation in a number of species and it is expected that high doses given for an extended duration would impair fertility until the cessation of treatment.

Chemoprevention in Lynch Syndrome — hormonal agents and evidence limits: Oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer by 50% in the general population. In women with Lynch Syndrome exposed to Depo-Medroxyprogesterone or OCPs for three months, endometrium shows decreased epithelial proliferation and inactive/secretory histology, suggesting possible chemoprevention utility; however, whether these effects reduce endometrial cancer risk is unknown. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system also is associated with lower endometrial cancer risk and has been used in treating early low-grade disease, but there are limited data for chemoprevention in Lynch Syndrome.

### Progesterone [^116wqeGi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A. General

1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.

2. Fluid Retention

Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation.

3. Dizziness and Drowsiness

Progesterone capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Progesterone capsules should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime.

B. Patient Information

General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts.

Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe progesterone capsules.

C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy:

Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests.

Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency (LPD) — Infertile women suspected of having abnormal luteal function due to an underlying medical condition should be evaluated and appropriately treated for an identified abnormality. Histologic dating of the endometrium with endometrial biopsies is not recommended. Additional research is needed to determine if testing modalities, such as combined testing (i.e., luteal progesterone measurement and luteal phase length < 10 days for the diagnosis of LPD), identifies a subgroup of patients with poorer reproductive outcomes and, if so, whether treatment improves outcomes.

### Ulipristal acetate (Ella) [^114gQMFi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor.

The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depend on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration.

Pharmacodynamic data showed that administration of ella to 34 women in the late follicular phase postponed follicular rupture for at least 5 days in all (100%) of 8 subjects who took ella before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and 11 (79%) of 14 subjects who took ella immediately before ovulation (when LH has already started to rise). However, treatment was not effective in postponing follicular rupture when administered on the day of LH peak.

Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 ± 2.2 mm (mean ± SD).

Hormonal Contraceptives after ella intake:

In women initiating hormonal contraception (quickstart scenario):

When a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol 30 µg + levonorgestrel 150 µg was started the day after ella intake during the follicular phase, ella did not interfere with the COC's ability to suppress ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound, combined with serum progesterone and estradiol levels: ovarian activity was suppressed in 61.5% (24/39) of subjects receiving ella plus COC and 62.2% (23/37) of subjects receiving a placebo plus the COC. The incidence of ovulation was similar between the group that received ella plus the COC [33.3% (13/39)] and the group that received a placebo plus the COC [32.4% (12/37)].

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1158P3GC]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — progesterone withdrawal test (PWT): The foundation of this test centers on the understanding that although low E2 and high gonadotropin levels are informative of ovarian insufficiency, normal E2 levels (in the range that is deemed normal for early follicular phase) and normal gonadotropins are relatively poor discriminants of the many nonovarian causes of amenorrhea; interpretation of a failed response (i.e., no bleeding) to PWT can be twofold, secondary to a hypoestrogenic milieu or because of an inability of the endometrium to respond to an estrogen replete environment, and in FHA circulating E2 is suppressed (< 30 pg/mL) with the endometrium often quiescent; ultrasound findings of endometrial thickness can help guide decisions regarding proceeding with PWT, and the absence of withdrawal bleeding with a progestin challenge is predictable if ultrasound demonstrates an attenuated endometrium.

### Estradiol and progesterone (bijuva) [^114hBoBx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Endogenous progesterone is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium.

Progesterone enhances cellular differentiation and generally opposes the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progesterone exerts its effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to BIJUVA nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, a (cenestin) [^1154PXBz]. FDA (2004). Low credibility.

A. General

Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy. Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.
Elevated blood pressure. In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.
Hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.
Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice. Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.
Hypothyroidism. Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.
Fluid retention. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.
Hypocalcemia. Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia.
Ovarian cancer. The CE/MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE/MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 0.77–3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE/MPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations.
Exacerbation of endometriosis. Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.
Exacerbation of other conditions. Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.

### Pergolide (Permax) [^113LvmKT]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in mice using dietary levels of pergolide equivalent to oral doses of 0.6, 3.7, and 36.4 mg/kg/day in males and 0.6, 4.4, and 40.8 mg/kg/day in females. A 2-year study in rats was conducted using dietary levels equivalent to oral doses of 0.04, 0.18, and 0.88 mg/kg/day in males and 0.05, 0.28, and 1.42 mg/kg/day in females. The highest doses tested in the mice and rats were approximately 340 and 12 times the maximum human oral dose administered in controlled clinical trials (6 mg/day equivalent to 0.12 mg/kg/day).

A low incidence of uterine neoplasms occurred in both rats and mice. Endometrial adenomas and carcinomas were observed in rats. Endometrial sarcomas were observed in mice. The occurrence of these neoplasms is probably attributable to the high estrogen/progesterone ratio that would occur in rodents as a result of the prolactin-inhibiting action of pergolide. The endocrine mechanisms believed to be involved in the rodents are not present in humans. However, even though there is no known correlation between uterine malignancies occurring in pergolide-treated rodents and human risk, there are no human data to substantiate this conclusion.

Pergolide was evaluated for mutagenic potential in a battery of tests that included an Ames bacterial mutation assay, a DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, an in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay in cultured L5178Y cells, and a determination of chromosome alteration in bone marrow cells of Chinese hamsters. A weak mutagenic response was noted in the mammalian cell gene mutation assay only after metabolic activation with rat liver microsomes. No mutagenic effects were obtained in the 2 other in vitro assays and in the in vivo assay. The relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.

A fertility study in male and female mice showed that fertility was maintained at 0.6 and 1.7 mg/kg/day but decreased at 5.6 mg/kg/day. Prolactin has been reported to be involved in stimulating and maintaining progesterone levels required for implantation in mice and, therefore, the impaired fertility at the high dose may have occurred because of depressed prolactin levels.

### Conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Premphase) [^116JUuHn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.

Parenterally administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation; although available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. MPA may achieve its beneficial effect on the endometrium in part by decreasing nuclear estrogen receptors and suppression of epithelial DNA synthesis in endometrial tissue. Androgenic and anabolic effects of MPA have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Currently, there are no pharmacodynamic data known for PREMPRO or PREMPHASE tablets.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, bone, skeletal tissue and central nervous system. Progestins produce similar endometrial changes to those of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.

### Estradiol and progesterone [^112vuKBG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Fluid Retention

Estrogens plus progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Monitor any woman with a condition(s) that might predispose her fluid retention, such as a cardiac or renal impairment. Discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy, including estradiol and progesterone capsules, with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention.

5.13 Hypocalcemia

Estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy, including estradiol and progesterone capsules, outweigh the risks in such women.

5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis

A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy.

5.15 Hereditary Angioedema

Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy, including estradiol and progesterone capsules, outweigh the risks in such women.

5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions

Estrogen therapy, including estradiol and progesterone capsules, may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in women with such conditions.

5.17 Laboratory Tests

Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Comments and evidence summary — uncertain pregnancy status and transitional protection: In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting the implant likely exceed any risk, and starting the implant should be considered at any time with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an implant from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after implant placement, and no direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting the implant at different times of the cycle.

Pharmacological treatments — initial therapy selection balances teratogenic risk and patient preferences: for the majority of women with hirsutism who are not seeking fertility, we suggest oral contraceptives as initial therapy for treating patient-important hirsutism; for most women, we suggest against antiandrogen monotherapy as initial therapy unless these women use adequate contraception, although women who are not sexually active, have undergone permanent sterilization, or use long-acting reversible contraception may use either oral contraceptives or antiandrogens as initial therapy, with the choice depending on preferences regarding efficacy, side effects, and cost; for most women, we do not suggest one oral contraceptive over another as initial therapy.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^111wVpXE]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Luteal progesterone testing — Serum progesterone determinations provide a reliable and objective measure of ovulation if obtained at the appropriate time in the cycle. A serum progesterone measurement should generally be obtained approximately 1 week before the expected onset of the next menses, rather than on any one specific cycle day (eg, day 21), and a progesterone concentration > 3 ng/mL provides presumptive and sufficient evidence of recent ovulation. Because luteal serum progesterone levels can fluctuate sevenfold over a few hours, a single progesterone value may be used to confirm ovulation, but not to assess the quality of the luteal phase.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^116xD4wk]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.
