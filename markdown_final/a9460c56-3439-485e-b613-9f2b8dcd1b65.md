## Question

Management of cannabis use disorder in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management plan for cannabis use disorder in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about screening and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify initial treatment selection, including the strength of psychosocial versus pharmacologic options. Next, I will consider harm-reduction strategies, withdrawal management, and comorbidities. After that, I need to check special populations and implementation issues like digital tools and follow-up. Finally, I will review the strength of evidence and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, ensuring I continuously validate claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the screening and diagnostic framework. Routine screening for unhealthy drug use is recommended in adults, which should include cannabis, using validated tools such as ASSIST or a single-item screen followed by DSM-5 diagnostic confirmation when positive, while noting that evidence is insufficient for or against screening solely to improve treatment enrollment, so I need to be careful not to overstate a screening-to-outcome benefit claim [^113EzLsV] [^112tK27z].

> Wait, let me verify initial treatment selection before I anchor on medications. High-quality guidelines converge on psychosocial interventions as first-line for cannabis use disorder, with a weak recommendation for CBT, MET, combined CBT/MET, and consideration of contingency management as adjuncts; this is supported by systematic reviews showing improvements in abstinence and reduced cannabis use frequency, though the certainty is often low to very low, so I should present this as the best-available standard rather than definitive superiority [^112QGWML] [^1124n57P] [^11743nmH] [^116iUDKv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacotherapy. I should double-check guideline positions and the pharmacologic evidence base. Multiple high-credibility sources state there is insufficient evidence to recommend pharmacotherapy for cannabis use disorder, including SSRIs, mixed-action antidepressants, buspirone, N-acetylcysteine, and cannabinoid agonists, with small or inconsistent effects and notable limitations in study quality; the 2025 Cochrane review again concludes that medications remain experimental for CUD, so I must avoid implying any approved pharmacologic treatment at this time [^116x5m4q] [^113WLpZ4] [^111SmNQt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cannabidiol might be a promising standalone option based on some narrative summaries, but I should correct that impression. Umbrella reviews indicate that potential benefits of CBD for cannabis withdrawal and craving are largely tied to nabiximols, a 1:1 CBD:THC combination, and that CBD monotherapy has not demonstrated efficacy for CUD; thus, I should not recommend CBD alone for treatment of CUD outside of research settings [^1115nTFM] [^116gN7US].

> Next, I should review harm-reduction and relapse-prevention strategies. Let me consider patient-centered goals, since many adults prefer reduction rather than abstinence; MET-CBT with abstinence-based contingency management can increase point and continuous abstinence, while community reinforcement approaches show large but uncertain effects in single studies, and mindfulness-based relapse prevention is reasonable though evidence is limited; I need to ensure I align the plan with patient preference and local feasibility [^1124n57P] [^115oK4XV] [^111vJK9r] [^111S3YwF].

> I will now examine withdrawal management. There are no approved medications for cannabis withdrawal, so supportive care and symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy for insomnia, anxiety, or GI upset may be used short term; in perioperative or severe cases, low-dose cannabinoid agonists like dronabinol can be considered off-label, but I should confirm that this is reserved for exceptional circumstances and not routine outpatient care [^1157Twre] [^1129B8NE] [^113EJNHa].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. I need to ensure acute management includes cannabis cessation as definitive therapy, with ondansetron for nausea and consideration of haloperidol, droperidol, or topical capsaicin for refractory cases; I should also coordinate follow-up to prevent relapse given high recurrence rates without sustained abstinence [^11375CAr] [^116KJ6ov] [^116TFh9f] [^1152UEH6].

> Let me consider comorbidities, because they materially affect outcomes. I should confirm and treat co-occurring psychiatric disorders, as anxiety, depression, and psychosis are common and can worsen CUD trajectories; in first-episode psychosis, integrated treatments are needed because standard early-intervention models alone have not reliably reduced cannabis use, and I should avoid premature psychiatric diagnoses during intoxication or withdrawal, favoring CBT-based approaches and supportive medications with close monitoring early in abstinence [^116iUDKv] [^1125pspD] [^113d3yUH].

> I need to check special populations next. For older adults, I should apply the same evidence-based psychosocial treatments while emphasizing higher susceptibility to dose-related harms, fall risk, cognitive effects, and cardiovascular risks; counseling to avoid high-potency THC products and synthetic cannabinoids is prudent, and residential treatment may be appropriate when outpatient efforts fail [^116vAm7L] [^111bN4yo] [^116Jtaef] [^116zZoKR]. For people with HIV, cannabinoid use should generally be discouraged due to neuropsychiatric risks and lack of effective pharmacotherapy, so I should prioritize behavioral interventions and harm reduction counseling [^111ozX91].

> Next, I should review implementation and follow-up. Brief interventions of 60 minutes or fewer are not recommended for diagnosed CUD, so I should plan for multi-session, structured psychosocial care and consider adjuncts such as telephone-based support, digital tools, and peer linkage to mutual-help groups; I should also acknowledge that evidence for mindfulness-based therapies is insufficient for a strong recommendation, aligning choices with patient preference and availability [^117GLPcY] [^117UHT36] [^1125gQSt] [^111wbBkm] [^111vJK9r].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and certainty of evidence so I communicate uncertainty accurately. Systematic reviews consistently show psychosocial interventions improve short-term abstinence and reduce cannabis use versus inactive controls, but certainty is low to very low, effects attenuate over time, and optimal dose, duration, and components remain unclear; pharmacotherapy trials are small, heterogeneous, and largely negative, reinforcing that medications remain investigational for CUD [^1124n57P] [^11743nmH] [^115gDT27] [^111SmNQt].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Screen all adults for unhealthy drug use including cannabis, confirm DSM-5 CUD when positive, offer structured psychosocial treatment with CBT, MET, or combined CBT/MET and consider contingency management, avoid brief interventions for diagnosed CUD, manage withdrawal supportively without routine pharmacotherapy, address comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, tailor for older adults and people with HIV, and arrange continuing care with relapse-prevention planning; I should document shared decision-making around abstinence versus reduction goals and schedule follow-up to monitor progress and adjust the plan [^113EzLsV] [^112QGWML] [^117GLPcY] [^1157Twre] [^113dDtGY] [^111ozX91].

---

The cornerstone of adult cannabis use disorder care is **CBT with MET and contingency management** [^112QGWML] [^115oK4XV], which improve abstinence and reduce use; **no medications are FDA-approved**, though gabapentin or NAC may be considered for severe withdrawal or high-risk patients [^115HLLKr] [^115gDT27]. Use **SBIRT for screening** [^113dDtGY] and refer to specialized care when indicated [^113dDtGY]; address comorbidities, provide harm-reduction counseling, and consider telehealth or digital tools to enhance access and retention [^1125gQSt] [^115oK4XV]. Management should be individualized, with close monitoring for relapse and adverse effects, and escalation to intensive outpatient or residential care if outpatient treatment fails [^116zZoKR].

---

## Screening and assessment

- **Screening**: Use validated tools (e.g. AUDIT-C, ASSIST, CUDIT-R) to identify at-risk use and guide intervention [^116foKGh].

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Evaluate frequency, quantity, potency, route, withdrawal, cravings, comorbid psychiatric/substance use disorders, and functional impairment [^116P5nns].

- **Severity assessment**: Use DSM-5 criteria to classify severity and guide treatment intensity [^1117UcxH].

---

## Psychosocial interventions (first-line treatment)

Psychosocial treatments are the **evidence-based foundation** of care; **CBT reduces use and relapse** and improves functioning [^11743nmH] [^1124n57P].

| **Intervention** | **Description** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | Targets triggers, cravings, and relapse; builds coping skills | High |
| Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) | Enhances readiness to change and reduces ambivalence | High |
| Contingency management (CM) | Provides incentives for abstinence; increases retention and abstinence | High |
| Mindfulness-based relapse prevention | Integrates mindfulness to reduce relapse risk | Moderate |
| Community reinforcement approach | Enhances social/recreational alternatives to use | Moderate |

---

Brief interventions are **not recommended for diagnosed CUD** because they lack efficacy; use structured, multi-session care instead [^117GLPcY] [^11743nmH].

---

## Pharmacological interventions (adjunctive or experimental)

- **No FDA-approved medications**: Evidence is insufficient for routine use; consider only in select cases [^115HLLKr] [^115gDT27].

- **Potential options**: Gabapentin may reduce withdrawal; NAC shows modest benefit in some trials; cannabinoid agonists (e.g. dronabinol) can be used short-term for severe withdrawal in monitored settings [^113WLpZ4] [^1129B8NE].

- **SSRIs/antidepressants**: Generally ineffective for CUD; avoid routine use [^111SmNQt].

---

## Management of cannabis withdrawal syndrome

- **Symptom management**: Use supportive care (hydration, sleep hygiene, anxiety management) [^113EJNHa].

- **Medications**: Consider short-term gabapentin, melatonin, or dronabinol for severe symptoms [^113WLpZ4] [^1129B8NE].

- **Monitoring**: Track withdrawal severity and relapse risk closely [^113d3yUH].

---

## Addressing comorbidities

Comorbid psychiatric disorders should be treated concurrently with **integrated care** [^1125pspD]. Co-occurring substance use should be managed with coordinated, multidisciplinary care [^1164FZm2]. Medical comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory) require monitoring and management throughout treatment [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Adolescents and young adults**: Use CBT/MET with family involvement; CM improves outcomes [^112QGWML] [^115YufEk] [^112UqzsU].

- **Older adults**: Use caution due to higher risk of cognitive, cardiovascular, and fall-related harms; consider residential care if needed [^113zg6n1] [^111bN4yo] [^116zZoKR].

- **Pregnant/breastfeeding patients**: Strongly advise cessation due to fetal/infant risks [^116FRdJ9].

---

## Relapse prevention and follow-up

- **Continuing care**: Provide ongoing support, CM, and peer linkage to sustain recovery [^111wbBkm].

- **Telehealth**: Use structured phone/video care to improve access and retention [^1125gQSt].

- **Monitoring**: Use urine drug testing and self-report to track use and guide care [^notfound].

---

## Emerging trends and research needs

Digital interventions show promise for **broadening access and engagement** [^115YufEk]. Research is needed to identify effective pharmacotherapies and to define optimal treatment duration and intensity [^111SmNQt] [^11743nmH]. Implementation science should guide real-world uptake of evidence-based care [^112C7Xd5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| CBT, MET, CM | First-line, strongly recommended |
| Gabapentin, NAC | Consider for severe withdrawal or high-risk patients |
| SSRIs, other antidepressants | Not recommended |
| Brief interventions | Not recommended for diagnosed CUD |
| Telehealth, digital tools | Consider to enhance access and retention |

---

Effective management of adult cannabis use disorder centers on **CBT, MET, and CM**, with individualized care, comorbidity management, and ongoing support; **medications are not first-line** but may be used adjunctively for severe withdrawal or high-risk cases.

### Psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorder and mental health comorbidities: a narrative review [^116iUDKv]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug worldwide, and it is estimated that up to 30% of people who use cannabis will develop a cannabis use disorder (CUD). Demand for treatment of CUD is increasing in almost every region of the world and cannabis use is highly comorbid with mental disorders, where sustained use can reduce treatment compliance and increase risk of relapse. In this narrative review, we outline evidence for psychosocial and pharmacological treatment strategies for CUD, both alone and when comorbid with psychosis, anxiety or depression. Psychosocial treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational enhancement therapy and contingency management are currently the most effective strategy for treating CUD but are of limited benefit when comorbid with psychosis. Pharmacological treatments targeting the endocannabinoid system have the potential to reduce cannabis withdrawal and cannabis use in CUD. Mental health comorbidities including anxiety, depression and psychosis hinder effective treatment and should be addressed in treatment provision and clinical decision making to reduce the global burden of CUDs. Antipsychotic medication may decrease cannabis use and cannabis craving as well as psychotic symptoms in patients with CUD and psychosis. Targeted treatments for anxiety and depression when comorbid with CUD are feasible.

DISCUSSION

Framing the evidence on CBD for SUDs

This study offers a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic effects of CBD, alone or in combination with THC, on all SUDs. In contrast, existing systematic or umbrella reviews primarily focus on various medical conditions or mental disorders as main outcomes, often relegating or excluding SUDs. The only review specifically centered on SUDs as the main outcome was a scoping review by Fernandes et al. which indicated that both CBD and THC have potential for treating certain SUDs such as cannabis use disorders, though the evidence is limited. Therefore, this umbrella review consolidates currently available evidence on the possible beneficial effects of CBD as a management strategy for SUDs.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis use disorder [^115gDT27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (a problematic pattern of cannabis use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress). This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in May 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal and/or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who are likely to be dependent.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: 1) abstinence at the end of treatment; 2) intensity of withdrawal including craving; 3) nature, incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and 4) severe AE (SAE); 5) withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects and whether the planned medication regimen was modified in response to adverse effects; 6) completion of scheduled treatment. Important outcomes were: 1) cannabis use at the end of treatment; 2) number of participants engaged in further treatment; 3) economic outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias in results included in meta-analyses using the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effect meta-analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we reported results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 37 RCTs (3201 participants). Most were undertaken in the United States (29), Australia (4), Israel (2), Canada (1) and the United Kingdom (1), mainly recruiting adults (mean age 22–41 years), with four studies only including young people (mean age 17–21 years). In 32 studies, most of the participants were male (56–92%). Five studies targeted participants with comorbidities (depression (2), bipolar disorder (1), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1)). Eleven studies received study medicines from the manufacturing company and none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Thirty-six studies compared active medications and placebo; one study compared four active medications. Medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the potential for synthesis.

Synthesis Of Results

Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.52; 4 studies, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; 2 studies, 270 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may be no more likely with cannabidiol (RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.54 to 9.32; 1 study, 68 participants; low-certainty evidence) or with anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.92; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence), when compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain. AE and SAE. There was probably little to no difference in the likelihood of AEs in participants treated with THC preparations (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 5 studies, 507 participants), cannabidiol (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 2 studies, 57 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.07; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.11; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.13; 4 studies, 331 participants) or oxytocin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.47; 1 study, 16 participants) (both low-certainty evidence), compared with placebo. SAE may be no more likely with THC preparations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.9; 7 studies, 584 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.33; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 4.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 99.48; 2 studies, 298 participants), compared with placebo (all low-certainty evidence). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more likely with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.86; 5 studies, 257 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. There may be little to no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations (RR 1.77, 95%CI 0.4 to 7.85; 5 studies, 507 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.03 to 12.53; 2 studies, 418 participants) compared with placebo (both low-certainty evidence). We found that completion of treatment was probably not more likely with cannabidiol (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 92 participants), anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03; 6 studies, 407 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23; 2 studies, 418 participants), or PF-04457845 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with THC (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; 7 studies, 582 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all the clinically-important pharmacotherapies investigated and, for half of their outcomes, the quality of the evidence was low (44%) or very low (11%). Given the limited evidence of efficacy, those pharmacotherapies should still be considered experimental for treating cannabis use disorder. The greater withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects seen with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may limit their therapeutic value.

Implications for research and practice

Several PSIs demonstrated clinically meaningful effects on abstinence and level of cannabis use and, in the absence of alternative treatments, it would be reasonable to suggest they are offered for CUD. However, because of the low certainty of evidence and small number of studies this recommendation for clinical practice is tentative.

To improve the robustness of the evidence base, and inform policy and practice, additional high‐quality RCTs are needed. This is the same conclusion reached by Gates et al. in their 2016 Cochrane review. Studies should be prospectively registered with published trial protocols to minimize bias from selection of the reported results. Studies should be adequately powered and ensure the assessors are blinded, at least to the alternative intervention in case of self‐reported outcomes. To reduce the impact of missing outcome data, trials should incorporate strategies to retain and follow‐up participants and clearly report information concerning those who have withdrawn. Future research on core outcome sets and standardized measurement of outcomes should also involve people with CUD.

Many trials in this review were conducted over a decade ago and may not generalize to contemporary cannabis use. In recent years, there has been a surge in CUD incidence among adolescents and young adults. While we had insufficient data to explore whether age may moderate the effectiveness of PSIs, the specific needs of young people should be considered within treatment services. The potency of cannabis has also increased over time and is associated with risk of CUD and more severe dependence and may reduce treatment effectiveness. Future studies should also ensure participants from more diverse backgrounds are recruited, as the current evidence base predominantly includes White male participants. Only three studies included people with affective problems, and four others reported mental health co‐morbidities in some participants, whereas most excluded people with severe mental health problems (e.g. suicide risk, psychosis). Mental health disorders commonly co‐occur with CUD, as does nicotine dependence. Evaluation of integrated treatments may be valuable to improve outcomes for people with CUD.

Such research would underpin the development of cannabis‐specific, evidence‐based, practice guidelines.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127BLSN]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the absence of a core outcome set, there is no established consensus for what constitutes a clinically meaningful change in outcomes. For this review, we considered a 10% increase in abstinence and completion of treatment and halving the level of cannabis use in the intervention group would represent clinically meaningful changes. However, these thresholds may be considered high, especially from a harm‐reduction perspective. Abstinence is difficult to achieve and a smaller reduction in cannabis use may be meaningful for people with CUD. It is possible that some PSIs would have been considered effective if lower thresholds had been used.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157h9EY]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In 2022, the number of people age 15 to 64 years using cannabis was estimated as 228 million, representing 4.4% of the global population. The risk of developing dependence on cannabis significantly increases with increasing frequency of use. The diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5), requires the presence of at least two of 11 criteria. These include hazardous use, social or interpersonal problems related to use, neglect of major roles, withdrawal, tolerance and cravings, among other features. DSM‐5 CUD amalgamated previous diagnoses of cannabis dependence and cannabis abuse included in DSM‐IV. Cannabis dependence is also listed in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

The prevalence of CUD has been escalating globally, affecting over 15 million men and over 8 million women in 2019. The burden of CUD is the highest among young adults 20 to 24 years. The number of people enrolling in treatment for cannabis use has been increasing globally, and it is also the most frequently cited problem drug among people entering drug treatment. For instance, across Europe, number of adults seeking treatment increased from 27 per 100 000 in 2010 to 35 per 100 000 in 2019.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adults using cannabis should be offered brief interventions, focused on individualized feedback and advice. However, for people diagnosed with CUD or dependence, such brief interventions have limited benefit and WHO recommend they should be referred for specialist cannabis‐specific treatment. Psychosocial interventions (PSIs) are, currently, the only recommended treatment for people with CUD. This recommendation is supported by evidence from systematic reviews that suggest PSIs are effective for treatment of CUD. In contrast, evidence for the use of pharmacological treatments for CUD is lacking. However, these previous reviews provide limited insight into the specific types of PSIs that are most effective for treating CUD. For example, some reviews aggregate various types of PSIs for comparison against inactive controls in pairwise meta‐analysis, some provide a descriptive summary of results from individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while others report an overview of findings from published systematic reviews.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1124n57P]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (CUD).

Methods

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs; PROSPERO protocol CRD42024553382) of psychosocial interventions for CUD lasting > 4 sessions, delivered synchronously, to individuals with CUD aged ≥ 16 years, in inpatient, outpatient or community‐based settings. We searched databases (MEDLINE/PsycInfo/Cochrane CENTRAL) to 12 June 2024. We assessed results using Risk of Bias 2 and conducted pairwise meta‐analyses. Primary outcomes were continuous‐ and point‐abstinence and withdrawal intensity at the end of treatment, treatment completion and adverse events.

Results

We included 22 RCTs (3304 participants). Relative to an inactive/non‐specific comparator, cognitive‐behavioural therapy with motivation enhancement (MET‐CBT) increased point abstinence [odds ratio (OR) = 18.27; 95% confidence interval (9.00−37.07)] and continuous abstinence [OR = 2.72; (1.20−6.19)], but reduced treatment completion [OR = 0.53; (0.35−0.85)]. Dialectical behavioural/acceptance and commitment therapy increased point abstinence versus inactive/non‐specific comparator [OR = 4.34; (1.74−10.80)]. The effect of MET‐CBT plus affect management versus MET‐CBT on point abstinence was OR = 7.85 (0.38−163.52). The effect of MET‐CBT plus abstinence‐based contingency management versus MET‐CBT on point abstinence was OR = 3.78 (0.83−17.25), and on continuous abstinence OR = 1.81 (0.61−5.41). For MET‐CBT plus abstinence‐contingency management versus MET‐CBT plus attendance‐contingency management, the effect on point abstinence was OR = 1.61 (0.72−3.60), and on continuous abstinence OR = 2.04 (0.75−5.58). The effect of community reinforcement on point abstinence was OR = 0.29 (0.04−1.90) versus MET‐CBT, and on continuous abstinence OR = 47.36 (16.00−140.21) versus non‐specific comparator. Interventions other than MET‐CBT may not affect treatment completion. No adverse events were reported. No study reported withdrawal intensity. Two economic evaluations reported higher costs for more complex interventions and contingency management.

Conclusions

Cognitive‐behavioural therapy with motivation enhancement and dialectical behavioural/acceptance and commitment therapy may increase abstinence among people with cannabis use disorder relative to an inactive/non‐specific comparator. The conclusions remain tentative due to low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence and the small number of studies.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (CUD).

Methods

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs; PROSPERO protocol CRD42024553382) of psychosocial interventions for CUD lasting > 4 sessions, delivered synchronously, to individuals with CUD aged ≥ 16 years, in inpatient, outpatient or community-based settings. We searched databases (MEDLINE/PsycInfo/Cochrane CENTRAL) to 12 June 2024. We assessed results using Risk of Bias 2 and conducted pairwise meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were continuous- and point-abstinence and withdrawal intensity at the end of treatment, treatment completion and adverse events.

Results

We included 22 RCTs (3304 participants). Relative to an inactive/non-specific comparator, cognitive-behavioural therapy with motivation enhancement (MET-CBT) increased point abstinence [odds ratio (OR) = 18.27; 95% confidence interval (9.00–37.07)] and continuous abstinence [OR = 2.72; (1.20–6.19)], but reduced treatment completion [OR = 0.53; (0.35–0.85)]. Dialectical behavioural/acceptance and commitment therapy increased point abstinence versus inactive/non-specific comparator [OR = 4.34; (1.74–10.80)]. The effect of MET-CBT plus affect management versus MET-CBT on point abstinence was OR = 7.85 (0.38–163.52). The effect of MET-CBT plus abstinence-based contingency management versus MET-CBT on point abstinence was OR = 3.78 (0.83–17.25), and on continuous abstinence OR = 1.81 (0.61–5.41). For MET-CBT plus abstinence-contingency management versus MET-CBT plus attendance-contingency management, the effect on point abstinence was OR = 1.61 (0.72–3.60), and on continuous abstinence OR = 2.04 (0.75–5.58). The effect of community reinforcement on point abstinence was OR = 0.29 (0.04–1.90) versus MET-CBT, and on continuous abstinence OR = 47.36 (16.00–140.21) versus non-specific comparator. Interventions other than MET-CBT may not affect treatment completion. No adverse events were reported. No study reported withdrawal intensity. Two economic evaluations reported higher costs for more complex interventions and contingency management.

Conclusions

Cognitive-behavioural therapy with motivation enhancement and dialectical behavioural/acceptance and commitment therapy may increase abstinence among people with cannabis use disorder relative to an inactive/non-specific comparator. The conclusions remain tentative due to low- to very low-certainty evidence and the small number of studies.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS

The management of substance withdrawal typically includes pharmacological agents which reduce clinically significant withdrawal symptoms. Cannabis does not have any approved medications for MAW, despite a well‐recognized and clinically significant withdrawal profile. A number of novel agents have been examined with some promising results (Table 2). This is an important avenue of future research, with some agents showing early efficacy. For this reason, cannabis agonists have been cautiously used 'off‐label' for cannabis withdrawal.

The mainstay of cannabis withdrawal management has been psychosocial education, supportive counselling and behavioural therapies. Despite the wide use of these approaches in clinical practice, few empirical studies have been conducted. These approaches need to be evaluated in controlled research settings. Given the heterogeneity of cannabis withdrawal features and substantial individual variations between patients, new developments in the management of cannabis use disorder and withdrawal are likely to include more targeted behavioural approaches (e.g.). The provision of increased on‐line and digital approaches to assist patients in managing cannabis withdrawal may improve accessibility and reduce costs, compared to face‐to‐face health services.

The legalization of non‐medical cannabis use in a number of high‐income countries has reduced cannabis prices and increased sales of high‐potency cannabis products in these jurisdictions. The cannabis industry is lobbying to reduce cannabis taxes, opposing restrictions on maximum THC levels and promoting the sale of high‐potency cannabis such as cannabis edibles, oils, extracts and waxes. Although the effects of these changes have not yet been formally evaluated, increased use of high‐potency cannabis is likely to increase the risks for CUD and the severity of withdrawal. Public health messaging should include independent information and advice on the risks of using higher‐potency cannabis.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^113d3yUH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Adolescent and young adult substance use — psychosis risk and early management highlights that psychosis risk is relevant across substances and especially with cannabis; longitudinal studies note that early-onset cannabis use before age 16 years, chronic/persistent, high-frequency, and high–THC potency can precipitate or exacerbate psychosis, and meta-analyses conclude heavy cannabis use increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Caution is warranted in assigning a new psychotic diagnosis during substance withdrawal because symptoms can last for weeks to months after discontinuation, and when symptoms are observed only in intoxication or withdrawal they are likely to diminish and disappear within a week to a month of abstinence; the recommendation in the first month of abstinence is to recognize and treat these symptoms with cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT)–based approaches and supportive medications for withdrawal symptoms and monitoring, rather than giving a separate psychiatric diagnosis with pharmacological treatment. Observational studies and clinical trials show that mental health problems increase with increased alcohol and cannabis use and that abstinence from and reduction in alcohol and cannabis use are associated with improvements in mental health symptoms, including in youth.

CONCLUSIONS

This review found that MET‐CBT, DBT/ACT and community reinforcement may be superior to inactive/non‐specific interventions for the treatment of CUD. Effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of other therapies and their combinations were less clear. The evidence for the effectiveness and safety of PSIs is of low to very low certainty. Methodologically robust trials conducted in representative samples of people with CUD are needed to inform more certain recommendations for policy and clinical practice.

Certainty of evidence

We used the GRADE framework to assess the certainty of evidence for effectiveness of PSIs on primary and secondary outcomes at the end of treatment. There are no established thresholds representing minimal clinically important differences for these outcomes. In this review, we describe intervention effects as clinically meaningful if they represent a 10% increase or reduction of risk in the intervention group relative to the comparator for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes effects are assessed as clinically meaningful if an intervention halves or doubles the frequency, quantity or duration of outcome relative to a comparator. The criteria considered for grading the certainty are outlined in Data S6.

### Psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder [^11743nmH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use disorder is the most commonly reported illegal substance use disorder in the general population; although demand for assistance from health services is increasing internationally, only a minority of those with the disorder seek professional assistance. Treatment studies have been published, but pressure to establish public policy requires an updated systematic review of cannabis-specific treatments for adults.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (compared with inactive control and/or alternative treatment) delivered to adults in an out-patient or community setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulaive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and reference lists of articles. Searched literature included all articles published before July 2015.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies examining a psychosocial intervention for cannabis use disorder (without pharmacological intervention) in comparison with a minimal or inactive treatment control or alternative combinations of psychosocial interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 23 randomised controlled trials involving 4045 participants. A total of 15 studies took place in the United States, two in Australia, two in Germany and one each in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil and Ireland. Investigators delivered treatments over approximately seven sessions (range, one to 14) for approximately 12 weeks (range, one to 56). Overall, risk of bias across studies was moderate, that is, no trial was at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias or reporting bias. Further, trials included a large total number of participants, and each trial ensured the fidelity of treatments provided. In contrast, because of the nature of the interventions provided, participant blinding was not possible, and reports of researcher blinding often were unclear or were not provided. Half of the reviewed studies included collateral verification or urinalysis to confirm self report data, leading to concern about performance and detection bias. Finally, concerns of other bias were based on relatively consistent lack of assessment of non-cannabis substance use or use of additional treatments before or during the trial period. A subset of studies provided sufficient detail for comparison of effects of any intervention versus inactive control on primary outcomes of interest at early follow-up (median, four months). Results showed moderate-quality evidence that approximately seven out of 10 intervention participants completed treatment as intended (effect size (ES) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.78, 11 studies, 1424 participants), and that those receiving psychosocial intervention used cannabis on fewer days compared with those given inactive control (mean difference (MD) 5.67, 95% CI 3.08 to 8.26, six studies, 1144 participants). In addition, low-quality evidence revealed that those receiving intervention were more likely to report point-prevalence abstinence (risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.83, six studies, 1166 participants) and reported fewer symptoms of dependence (standardised mean difference (SMD) 4.15, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.63, four studies, 889 participants) and cannabis-related problems compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.34, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.42, six studies, 2202 participants). Finally, very low-quality evidence indicated that those receiving intervention reported using fewer joints per day compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.55, 95% CI 2.51 to 4.59, eight studies, 1600 participants). Notably, subgroup analyses found that interventions of more than four sessions delivered over longer than one month (high intensity) produced consistently improved outcomes (particularly in terms of cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence) in the short term as compared with low-intensity interventions. The most consistent evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and particularly their combination for assisting with reduction of cannabis use frequency at early follow-up (MET: MD 4.45, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.00, four studies, 612 participants; CBT: MD 10.94, 95% CI 7.44 to 14.44, one study, 134 participants; MET + CBT: MD 7.38, 95% CI 3.18 to 11.57, three studies, 398 participants) and severity of dependence (MET: SMD 4.07, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.17, two studies, 316 participants; MET + CBT: SMD 7.89, 95% CI 0.93 to 14.85, three studies, 573 participants), although no particular intervention was consistently effective at nine-month follow-up or later. In addition, data from five out of six studies supported the utility of adding voucher-based incentives for cannabis-negative urines to enhance treatment effect on cannabis use frequency. A single study found contrasting results throughout a 12-month follow-up period, as post-treatment outcomes related to overall reduction in cannabis use frequency favoured CBT alone without the addition of abstinence-based or treatment adherence-based contingency management. In contrast, evidence of drug counselling, social support, relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation was weak because identified studies were few, information on treatment outcomes insufficient and rates of treatment adherence low. In line with treatments for other substance use, abstinence rates were relatively low overall, with approximately one-quarter of participants abstinent at final follow-up. Finally, three studies found that intervention was comparable with treatment as usual among participants in psychiatric clinics and reported no between-group differences in any of the included outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention were raised and partially resolved. Generalisability of findings was unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable although comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention was shown, in comparison with minimal treatment controls, to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least in the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention provided over more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence-based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder.

Adolescent cannabis use is a modifiable health behavior with potential adverse developmental, cognitive, psychological, and health effects. Over the last 2 decades, work to promote implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment has improved screening, use of validated screening tools, and preventive messaging. Current intervention strategies for cannabis use are associated with modest, short-term effects, and referral to treatment is limited by availability of resources for adolescent substance use. This article provides an update on the evidence base for screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment, and the current state of implementation focused on management of cannabis use disorder.

Medication use in clinical practice

No medications have been shown to be effective in MAW in randomized controlled trials (Table 2). In clinical practice, short‐term symptomatic medications have been used for (a) non‐specific general cannabis withdrawal syndrome features and (b) for specific withdrawal symptoms (e.g. sleep, nausea, anxiety, appetite stimulation) to improve patient comfort and retention during withdrawal (Table 3). As with all prescribing, a comprehensive medical, medicine and drug and alcohol use history should guide the use and doses of these medications. All medications have side‐effects and these need to be balanced against potential benefits from their unknown efficacy in this population.

### Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review [^111SmNQt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a growing concern, and evidence-based data are needed to inform treatment options.

Purpose

To review the benefits and risks of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of CUD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and clinical trial registries from inception through September 2019.

Study Selection

Pharmacotherapy trials of adults or adolescents with CUD that targeted cannabis abstinence or reduction, treatment retention, withdrawal symptoms, and other outcomes.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted by 1 investigator and confirmed by a second. Study quality was dually assessed, and strength of evidence (SOE) was determined by consensus according to standard criteria.

Data Synthesis

Across 26 trials, the evidence was largely insufficient. Low-strength evidence was found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) do not reduce cannabis use or improve treatment retention. Low- to moderate-strength evidence was found that buspirone does not improve outcomes and that cannabinoids do not increase abstinence rates (moderate SOE), reduce cannabis use (low SOE), or increase treatment retention (low SOE). Across all drug studies, no consistent evidence of increased harm was found.

Limitations

Few methodologically rigorous trials have been done. Existing trials are hampered by small sample sizes, high attrition rates, and heterogeneity of concurrent interventions and outcomes assessment.

Conclusion

Although data on pharmacologic interventions for CUD are scarce, evidence exists that several drug classes, including cannabinoids and SSRIs, are ineffective. Because of increasing access to and use of cannabis in the general population, along with a high prevalence of CUD among current cannabis users, an urgent need exists for more research to identify effective pharmacologic treatments.

### Cannabis use and cannabis use disorder [^112aPUhP]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is an underappreciated risk of using cannabis that affects ~10% of the 193 million cannabis users worldwide. The individual and public health burdens are less than those of other forms of drug use, but CUD accounts for a substantial proportion of persons seeking treatment for drug use disorders owing to the high global prevalence of cannabis use. Cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational enhancement therapy and contingency management can substantially reduce cannabis use and cannabis-related problems, but enduring abstinence is not a common outcome. No pharmacotherapies have been approved for cannabis use or CUD, although a number of drug classes (such as cannabinoid agonists) have shown promise and require more rigorous evaluation. Treatment of cannabis use and CUD is often complicated by comorbid mental health and other substance use disorders. The legalization of non-medical cannabis use in some high-income countries may increase the prevalence of CUD by making more potent cannabis products more readily available at a lower price. States that legalize medical and non-medical cannabis use should inform users about the risks of CUD and provide information on how to obtain assistance if they develop cannabis-related mental and/or physical health problems.

Cannabis use disorder — pharmacotherapy evidence and recommendation indicate that an SR from the VA Evidence Synthesis Program reviewed 12 trials and found antidepressants as a class were less likely than placebo to achieve abstinence with no difference in overall cannabis use or retention, and findings for other pharmacotherapies were insufficient or not identified; while not reviewed by the Work Group, one small RCT utilizing cannabidiol at two different doses showed some promise. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low due to small sample sizes, short duration, high dropout rates, and absence of treatment effect attributable to the intervention drug, and the existing evidence did not favor any medication for the treatment of cannabis use disorder; benefits and harms were balanced because the Work Group found no benefit and no significant harms except that antidepressants may negatively impact abstinence, patient values and preferences varied, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Efficacy of cannabidiol alone or in combination with δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol for the management of substance use disorders: an umbrella review of the evidence [^1115nTFM]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This umbrella review does not suggest any efficacy of CBD monotherapy as a therapeutic agent in SUDs. CBD primarily exhibits effects on cannabis withdrawal and craving symptoms when combined with THC in nabiximols. The CBD:THC 1:1 effects suggest that the potential benefits observed in cannabis withdrawal and craving may be because of THC, with CBD providing no additional benefit. We found no evidence for CBD alone, in the absence of THC, in managing cannabis and other SUDs. Notably, few SRs on this topic were of high methodological quality. Additional research is essential, incorporating data from robust RCTs, using comparable CBD interventions and standardized outcome measures.

Intervention and comparator categories.

Searches

We searched Ovid MEDLINE‐ALL and PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library using relevant subject headings, text‐words and search syntax appropriate to each resource (all available years to 12 June 2024). Reports of RCTs from Embase and CINAHL were captured via our search of CENTRAL. To identify potentially relevant economic evaluations, we ran separate searches in Ovid MEDLINE and Embase (all available years to 30 July 2024). Search strategies are provided in Data S3.

Study selection

Titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two reviewers using the Rayyan platform. Potentially relevant texts were retrieved in full and assessed independently by at least two reviewers using the LaserAI platform. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer, or the wider review team.

Data extraction

Using piloted, standardized forms created in LaserAI, we extracted details on study design and conduct, eligibility criteria, participant demographics and PROGRESS‐Plus characteristics, intervention and comparator details and outcome data. We used LaserAI's AI‐enhanced suggestions to support extraction of study characteristics. However, all suggestions were verified and amended, if needed, by a reviewer.

Arm‐level numerical data for dichotomous outcomes were extracted as the number of participants with event, number with available outcome data and number randomized into each arm (the denominator used in the analysis depended on outcome — see synthesis of results). For continuous outcomes, mean (M) with SD and number of participants analysed in each arm were extracted for end of treatment and follow‐up. Data processing steps in preparation for synthesis are outlined in Data S4.

Study characteristics and numerical data were extracted by a single reviewer and checked in detail by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer.

### Cannabis or cannabinoids for the management of chronic noncancer pain: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^116FRdJ9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians' Population Health and Medical Science Committee (PHMSC) developed this best practice advice to inform clinicians about what is currently known about the benefits and harms of cannabis or cannabinoids in the management of chronic noncancer pain and to provide advice for clinicians counseling patients seeking this therapy.

Methods

The PHMSC considers areas where evidence is uncertain or emerging or practice does not follow the evidence to provide clinical advice based on a review and assessment of scientific work, including systematic reviews and individual studies. Sources of evidence included a living systematic review on cannabis and cannabinoid treatments for chronic noncancer pain and a series of living systematic reviews and primary studies.

Best Practice Advice 1a

Clinicians should counsel patients about the benefits and harms of cannabis or cannabinoids when patients are considering whether to start or continue to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage their chronic noncancer pain.

Best Practice Advice 1b

Clinicians should counsel the following subgroups of patients that the harms of cannabis or cannabinoid use for chronic noncancer pain are likely to outweigh the benefits: young adult and adolescent patients, patients with current or past substance use disorder, patients with serious mental illness, and frail patients and those at risk for falling.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should advise against starting or continuing to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage chronic noncancer pain in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or actively trying to conceive.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should advise patients against the use of inhaled cannabis to manage chronic noncancer pain.

Potential for CBD in harm reduction

The findings across SRs indicate a role for CBD in managing withdrawal and craving symptoms in the use of cannabis, tobacco and opiates, rather than contributing to reduction or cessation of use. In the perspective of established and long‐term use where individuals wish to limit their consumption and associated risks at a given point, CBD may be helpful to improve well‐being as part of a harm reduction strategy for people who use drugs.

Limited quantitative results on CBD for SUD

Out of the 22 SRs, only 5 performed meta‐analyses. Three of these reviews could not conduct meta‐analyses on CBD‐only interventions because of a limited number of studies. One review solely conducted a meta‐analysis on the effectiveness of a nabiximols intervention. In another meta‐analysis, some methodological limitations were identified: subtotal standard mean difference (SMD) scores were assigned by cannabinoid type, but these were applied to different SUDs with distinct symptoms. Then a total SMD score was derived from these subtotal scores, but for compounds with varying cannabinoid compositions. Consequently, there is a paucity of quantitative results regarding the effects of CBD‐only interventions on specific SUD outcomes. One systematic review highlighted that no published study demonstrated the efficacy of CBD alone in treating any SUD. This underlines the necessity for additional high‐quality, large‐sample RCTs to explore the effects of CBD, either alone or in combination with other cannabinoids, on SUDs.

Older adults with substance use disorders — No studies examine specific treatments for SUD among older adults, so providers should consider the same evidence-based treatments that work for the general adult population. However, older adults often do not receive appropriate treatment even when engaged in the treatment system; in heroin-using adults over age 55 subtyped by onset of use before age 30 versus after age 30, Rates of receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which is the only evidence-based treatment, hovered just below 70% for the early onset group and just above 30% for the late onset, and in primary care among individuals with diagnosed OUD, older age was associated with less likelihood of getting medication treatment. High rates of alcohol and marijuana use among older adults, while perhaps not as serious as injection opioid use, also need to be addressed; Alcohol-related mortality is increasing in the U.S., including in older people, and Excessive alcohol use (not necessarily use that rises to the level of AUD) is associated with many health problems that plague older individuals, including cardiac disease, cancer, and dementia; It is incumbent upon providers treating older adults to inquire about alcohol use and counsel safe amounts of consumption, and Many older adults do not know that greater levels of consumption are hazardous and they may voluntarily reduce their use when educated, with Such reductions likely to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. While the effects of marijuana/cannabis use in older adults specifically have not received adequate investigation, the known adverse effects (including cognitive and motor impairment, possible increased risk for cardiovascular events, alterations in sleep, appetite, and mood, as well as cannabis withdrawal symptoms) are likely to be even more problematic in this age group compared to younger adults, and Many older adults also use multiple substances, with alcohol, marijuana, sedatives, and stimulants likely among them.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sYEQZ]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

A further limitation of our article may be that we only planned to undertake pairwise meta‐analyses (as outlined in our prospectively registered protocol) and, as such cannot form conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of all PSIs.

There has been some work on outcome toolkits, advocating for trialists to shift focus from abstinence (our primary outcomes) toward severity of CUD and level of cannabis use (our secondary outcome), as these are considered to be more relevant from a harm reduction perspective. However, there is still no agreed core outcome set for CUD and we found considerable variability in outcome definitions and measures across all studies. Additionally, prospectively registered protocols were not available for 15 of 22 studies, of which five of 15 were published before 2005, when trial registration requirements were implemented in medical journals. As such, it is unclear whether our selected outcomes were not measured, or were measured but not reported, and we consider the implications of publication bias in Data S6. Abstinence was measured using self‐report or urine tests, with limited details on thresholds for detecting presence of cannabinoids and which measure had informed the outcome assessment when both were collected. The definition of 'continuous' abstinence also varied across studies (6–14 weeks). Using different measures and timeframes within the abstinence outcomes likely contributed to moderate between‐study heterogeneity, which in turn reduces the certainty of findings.

Only two studies assessed safety outcome and both reported that no adverse events had occurred. Neither provided a definition of 'adverse event' or details on measurement. Reasons for participant dropout were poorly reported across all studies. In combination with substantial missing data, this was a common source of high RoB in the results. Cannabis craving was reported in one study only and none reported on the intensity of withdrawal. This was unexpected considering the nature of the PSIs, some of which included training in affect management and dealing with withdrawal. For individuals with CUD, withdrawal symptoms can occur within the first week of ceasing cannabis use. Except for the studies of CM‐abstinence, it was not clear whether or when participants were expected to stop using cannabis. Therapeutic goals may extend beyond abstinence and include reduction in cannabis use or improvement in functioning, where withdrawal symptoms may be less likely to occur.

RELAPSE PREVENTION

No pharmacological approaches have been approved to prevent risk of relapse to CUD during or after MAW. Psychosocial‐based interventions are the first‐line treatment. The two most effective stand‐alone behavioural interventions are cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET). Both have similar efficacy. There is some evidence that combined CBT and MET produces better outcomes than either approach alone.

Abstinence‐based contingency management (CM) using incentives to motivate and sustain cessation is an effective adjunct to CBT and MET increases rates of sustained abstinence. In the short term (up to 12–14 weeks), combined MET and CBT doubles abstinence rates and reduces consumption by an average of 25% in those who continue to use cannabis, compared to non‐active treatment. There is less evidence on efficacy in the longer term (> 9 months) after treatment. Other behavioural interventions for CUD that have been investigated include social support counselling (SS), drug education counselling (DE), relapse prevention (RP), mindfulness meditation (MM) and 12‐step mutual help groups. None of these interventions have enough data to support use at this time.

Sustained cannabis abstinence is the most effective treatment goal for patients who have a CUD and who have completed MAW. However, many patients enter treatment with moderation goals and clinicians must adapt their approaches to work effectively with these patients. Reduced use is a common outcome in outpatient studies, but how long these reductions are maintained and whether reduced use improves psychosocial functioning remains unclear. To retain patients with a moderation goal in a therapeutic relationship and reduce the risk of future cannabis related‐problems, low‐risk guidelines have been endorsed by a number of health jurisdictions (e.g.) and health experts (see Table 5).

TABLE 5
Low‐risk cannabis consumption guidelines

Most cannabis users also use other substances. Meta‐analyses demonstrate that psychosocial treatments for polysubstance use have weak efficacy compared to single‐substance psychosocial treatments. There are insufficient studies to recommend either treating multiple substances sequentially or concurrently. However, a recent meta‐analysis found that combined tobacco and/or cannabis interventions had a modest effect on reducing cannabis but not tobacco. These combined interventions did not increase tobacco or cannabis cessation rates.

Continuous abstinence

Ten studies measured continuous abstinence (lasting 6–14 weeks) up to the end of treatment. Most used self‐report measures, with only two using consecutive negative urine tests and one verifying self‐reports with urine tests. Evidence of effectiveness is of low to very low certainty because of concerns over high RoB, imprecision and inconsistency (see Data S12 for comparison‐specific assessments). Meta‐analyses included up to four studies per comparison (Figure 3). The common τ² was estimated as 0.49 (SE = 0.42). MET‐CBT may increase continuous abstinence relative to inactive/non‐specific comparators [OR = 2.72; (1.20–6.19)]. This analysis is characterized by high heterogeneity (I² = 82%) that may be explained by comparator type (waitlist or non‐specific). MET‐CBT plus CM‐abstinence may increase continuous abstinence relative to MET‐CBT plus CM‐attendance, although CIs are also consistent with a decrease in abstinence (i.e. favouring MET‐CBT plus CM‐attendance; [OR = 2.04; (0.75–5.58)]. There is little to no evidence of an effect of MET‐CBT plus CM‐abstinence relative to MET‐CBT [OR = 1.81; (0.61–5.41)]. The comparison of community reinforcement versus non‐specific comparator is based on one study with unclear definition of continuous abstinence and the effect estimate is highly uncertain [OR = 47.36; (16.00–140.21)].

### Cannabis use reported by patients receiving primary care in a large health system [^116KLjbX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of past 3-month cannabis use, and what are the reasons for use among patients in a large health system?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 175 734 patients, 17.0% reported cannabis use, among whom 34.7% had results indicative of moderate to high risk for cannabis use disorder. While most patients (76.1%) reported using cannabis to manage a health symptom, very few patients identified as medical cannabis users.

Meaning

Given the high rates of cannabis use, especially for symptom management, and the high levels of disordered use, it is essential that health care systems implement routine screening of primary care patients.

INTRODUCTION

The misuse of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, can have a broad range of consequences that affect an individual's physical health, mental well‐being, as well as societal functioning. The 2022 European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) report estimated that nearly 83.4 million Europeans reported having used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime, and 22.2 million reported having used cannabis in the last year. In 2018, the Global Burden Study (GBD) estimated that 1.5% of the overall global burden of disease was attributable to substance use disorders (SUD). Furthermore, in 2019, the GBD highlighted a significant rise in deaths because of SUDs over the past decade. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 35 million people suffer from SUDs. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) were the most prevalent of all SUDs in 2016 with an estimated 100.4 million cases. The most common SUDs were cannabis dependence (22.1 million cases) and opioid dependence (26.8 million cases). For illicit drugs, the estimated number of users increased by 23% from 2011 to 2021, partly because of population growth.

Affecting individuals' brain and behavior, SUDs are chronic and relapsing conditions characterized by an uncontrollable use of psychoactive substances classified into 10 distinct classes, among which alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and opioids are predominant. SUDs may co‐occur with physical and mental health conditions, leading to negative health and social outcomes. Consequently, various pharmacotherapies have been developed and are sought after to manage SUDs, including methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation and 'anti‐craving' medications for alcohol use disorder, alongside psychosocial interventions. Despite these interventions, relapse rates remain high because available drugs may be ineffective for reducing or ceasing substance use and specific treatments are lacking for substances such as cannabis, cocaine or amphetamine‐type stimulants. There remains an ongoing need for pharmacological tools to alleviate symptoms of substance‐related disorders and prevent drug relapse.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115Kqzpe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the extent of analysis. Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other pharmacotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported. Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence) or with N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin, oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^1152UEH6]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) management — Combining evidence-based psychosocial interventions and pharmacology may be necessary for successful long-term management of CHS. Preliminary evidence from 2 small placebo-controlled, randomized studies in adults with cannabinoid use disorder suggests that both fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors and CBD can reduce cannabis use, but larger studies are necessary. Other frequently suggested strategies lack scientific validation, such as switching to a lower Δ9THC/higher CBD formulation, use of edible forms, and avoiding Δ9THC concentrates. A single-center experience reported that > 40% of patients could stop oral treatments for CHS over time, but recidivism was high. Co-management with a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful for patients who have a lack of response to standard therapies or extensive psychiatric comorbidity. Anxiety and depression are very common associated conditions.

### Cannabis use disorder treatment preferences: a pilot survey in current users of cannabis [^111S3YwF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Highly effective treatments for cannabis use disorder (CUD) are lacking, and patient preferences have not been considered during treatment development. We therefore conducted an exploratory crowdsourced survey of individuals reporting current cannabis use and a willingness to cut down or quit their cannabis use, to determine their interest in various treatment aspects.

Methods

Subjects (n = 63) were queried about their willingness to take medications as a function of type, route, and regimen and to participate in adherence monitoring. Subjects were also asked about their willingness to engage in behavioral/psychosocial interventions as a function of type, setting, and duration. Measures theorized to be associated with treatment preferences were also collected, including cannabis use variables, readiness to change, reduction or cessation goal, perceived cessation barriers, and medication use beliefs and behaviors.

Results

Survey responses indicated that efforts to develop CUD medications should focus on nonsynthetic compounds administered orally or by mouth spray no more than once per day to maximize patient acceptance. Remote adherence monitoring and one-on-one outpatient behavioral treatment approaches, especially contingency management, are also anticipated to enhance participation. Most subjects indicated a preference to reduce their cannabis use rather than quit.

Conclusions

These data provide guidance for the development of CUD interventions based on the preferences of individuals interested in treatment for their cannabis use. Additional research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and determine if matching CUD patients with their preferred treatments improves success rates.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cjXZj]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our review followed a rigorous methodology. The protocol was prospectively registered and the database searches were comprehensive and recently conducted (12 June 2024). However, the number of studies included per meta‐analysis was small (up to six), and some relative intervention effects were based on single studies. This means that our pre‐planned subgroup analyses were not possible, and we were not able to investigate potentially important effect modifiers such as intensity and duration of cannabis use, mental health comorbidities, intervention intensity or equity characteristics. There were some differences in these variables. For example, MDFT and community reinforcement were only evaluated in adolescents/young adults and, although it was only tested in one study, MDFT lasted longer than other interventions (6 months compared with a median of 2–3 months) (see Data S1). We also excluded some publication types, such as conference abstracts, dissertations (all of which met additional exclusion criteria) or trial registration reports lacking outcome data. However, the extent to which omitting unpublished studies contributes to publication, small study or study selection biases is unclear, as is whether it leads to over‐ or under‐estimating intervention effects.

We implemented clearly defined eligibility criteria. However, the included studies used a variety of participant inclusion criteria regarding CUD, which may have contributed to the heterogeneity of the current findings. This variability may reflect changes in the diagnostic criteria over time. However, even within the same diagnostic categories, the severity of the disorder may vary and this was not consistently reported across all studies (Table 3).

To combine studies in a meta‐analysis, similar interventions and comparators were grouped. However, these groupings could impact interpretation of estimated effects. For instance, the study‐level effects were greater when MET‐CBT was compared with a waitlist control and smaller when compared with a non‐specific comparator (Figures 2, 3 and 5). This 'waitlist' effect is well‐known in behavioural intervention trials. Unfortunately, our review lacked sufficient studies for appropriately powered subgroup analyses by comparator type.

Completion of treatment

The number of participants who completed treatment was reported in 16 studies. Meta‐analyses included a maximum of five studies (Figure 4). The common τ² was estimated as 0.00 (SE = 0.13). There is low certainty evidence that MET‐CBT may be associated with lower completion rates than inactive/non‐specific comparators [OR = 0.53; (0.35−0.82)]. We found low certainty evidence for MET‐CBT plus CM‐abstinence compared with MET‐CBT [OR = 1.58; (0.85–2.94)], and for community reinforcement relative to MET‐CBT or non‐specific comparator [OR = 1.20; (0.49–2.96)]. The certainty of evidence is very low for DBT/ACT versus inactive/non‐specific comparators [OR = 1.42; (0.59−3.43)], MET‐CBT‐affect versus MET‐CBT [OR = 1.03; (0.45–2.32)] and MET‐CBT plus CM‐abstinence versus MET‐CBT plus CM‐attendance [OR = 1.12; (90.48–2.62)]. We had concerns over indirectness across all comparisons, RoB and imprecision for most comparisons and potentially missing evidence for MET‐CBT plus CM‐abstinence versus MET‐CBT plus CM‐attendance (Data S12).

Cannabis use disorder — pharmacotherapy (VA/DoD) states There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of cannabis use disorder (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, Not changed). While some patients seek pharmacologic assistance in reducing or abstaining from cannabis use, there is little to no evidence suggesting medication is effective. Drug trials examining candidate therapies in the cannabis literature are characterized by small sample sizes, short duration, high dropout rates, and absence of treatment effect attributable to the intervention drug, and some form of psychotherapy was provided in most of these studies to treatment and control groups, with the intensity of cannabis usage declining in both groups at similar rates. Two recent SRs failed to show evidence for effective pharmacotherapy, including one SR across 26 trials that failed to show that medication increased abstinence or reduced cannabis use, and another SR, Nielsen et al. (2019), that reviewed 21 RCTs and found synthetic delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, SSRIs, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone, and N-acetylcysteine were likely ineffective for the critical outcome of abstinence at the end of treatment. Several RCTs also failed to show a primary treatment effect of drug versus placebo, including one study each for bupropion sustained-release, nefazodone, fluoxetine, buspirone, and atomoxetine. Only a single gabapentin study demonstrated meaningful improvements in cannabis use and withdrawal symptoms, but the sample size was small (n = 50), and fluoxetine showed efficacy for depressive symptoms but did not improve cannabis use measures.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115uxYYU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit drug in the world. Demand for treatment of cannabis use disorders is increasing. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or supportive care for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to 4 March 2014), MEDLINE (to week 3 February 2014), EMBASE (to 3 March 2014) and PsycINFO (to week 4 February 2014). We also searched reference lists of articles, electronic sources of ongoing trials and conference proceedings, and contacted selected researchers active in the area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving the use of medications to reduce the symptoms and signs of cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in participants diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. All review authors confirmed the inclusion decisions and the overall process.

Main Results

We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 958 participants. For 10 studies the average age was 33 years; two studies targeted young people; and age data were not available for two studies. Approximately 80% of study participants were male. The studies were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. Three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications included preparations containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (two studies), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (two studies), mixed action antidepressants (three studies), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (three studies), an atypical antidepressant (two studies), an anxiolytic (one study), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (one study) and a glutamatergic modulator (one study). One study examined more than one medication. Diversity in the medications and the outcomes reported limited the extent that analysis was possible. Insufficient data were available to assess the utility of most of the medications to promote cannabis abstinence at the end of treatment. There was moderate quality evidence that completion of treatment was more likely with preparations containing THC compared to placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; 2 studies, 207 participants, P = 0.006). There was some evidence that treatment with preparations containing THC was associated with reduced cannabis withdrawal symptoms and craving, but this latter outcome could not be quantified. For mixed action antidepressants compared with placebo (2 studies, 179 participants) there was very low quality evidence on the likelihood of abstinence from cannabis at the end of follow-up (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.41), and moderate quality evidence on the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21). For this same outcome there was very low quality evidence for the effects of SSRI antidepressants (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53; 2 studies, 122 participants), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.46; 2 studies, 75 participants), and the atypical antidepressant, bupropion (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; 2 studies, 92 participants). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant) and N-acetylcysteine (glutamatergic modulator) was insufficient for quantitative estimates of their effectiveness, but these medications may be worth further investigation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many of the outcomes the quality was downgraded due to small sample sizes, inconsistency and risk of attrition bias. The quantitative analyses that were possible, combined with general findings of the studies reviewed, indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, atypical antidepressants (bupropion), anxiolytics (buspirone) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (atomoxetine) are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Preparations containing THC are of potential value but, given the limited evidence, this application of THC preparations should be considered still experimental. Further studies should compare different preparations of THC, dose and duration of treatment, adjunct medications and therapies. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin and the glutamatergic modulator N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### Cannabis use in first episode psychosis: what we have tried and why it hasn' T worked [^1125pspD]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 64% of individuals who have experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP) have used cannabis, and 30% of these have a cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use among those with FEP is associated with negative outcomes (e.g. positive symptoms, illness severity). Given the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis, and the increasing availability of high potency tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products, cannabis use prevention and treatment in people with FEP is a critical issue. Initial early intervention efforts that address cannabis and other substance use has been underwhelming. Early intervention programs for FEP generally include evidence-based practices focused on medication management, family psychoeducation, case management, individual therapy, and vocational services. Brief or optional cognitive behavioral therapy for substance use is often integrated in early intervention programs. The question is, are these interventions sufficient in their intensity and/or duration to reduce cannabis use?

The answer appears to be no. Young people enrolled in early intervention programs do not have lower levels of cannabis or other drug use than those who receive treatment as usual. In a recent secondary data analysis, we found that frequent cannabis use (> 20 days per month) was higher in those randomized to the early intervention treatment than those in usual care. These findings are consistent with the treatment outcomes of general co-occurring disorders. Few interventions for co-occurring disorders are designed to treat both schizophrenia spectrum and substance use disorders. Most are focused on improving psychiatric symptoms (e.g. assertive community treatment) or increasing drug or alcohol abstinence (e.g. contingency management). As a result, few interventions including contingency management (CM) consistently demonstrate reductions in both psychiatric symptoms and substance use. Although the addition of CM or other evidence-based interventions to early intervention programs for FEP is appealing, truly integrative treatments are needed to improve the lives of young people living with psychosis and substance use disorders.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^1117UcxH]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannabis dependence

Individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) generally experience greater severity and duration of cannabis withdrawal symptoms than those without CUD. This is most probably related to the greater frequency and quantity of their cannabis use and their heavier exposure to THC. CUD is characterized by persistent cannabis use despite negative effects on the social functioning and physical or mental health of the user or the health of other individuals. Two diagnostic systems classify and define the severity of the disorder: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)‐5 and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐11. CUD severity is coded in DSM‐5 as mild (presence of two to three symptoms), moderate (presence of four to five symptoms) or severe (presence of six or more symptoms). ICD‐11 classifies cannabis use into hazardous cannabis use (potential to cause harm), harmful pattern of cannabis use (causing harm) and cannabis dependence.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — research needs for substance use disorders highlights multiple priority areas: Studies of mobile health interventions that could connect patients on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with providers between visits and enable home drug testing with oral fluids are described. For stimulant use disorder, research is needed on effective pharmacotherapies versus placebo, and for cannabis use disorder, research is needed on pharmacotherapies versus placebos and on non‑pharmacologic treatments. For contingency management (CM), research is needed to further explore effectiveness and implementation for cannabis use disorder and to explore CM to reduce opioid use and improve treatment retention in MOUD. For benzodiazepine withdrawal and benzodiazepine use disorder, larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with reasonably long follow‑up (e.g., at least one year) are needed to evaluate medications adjunctive to benzodiazepines, and research is needed on treatments to help prevent relapse post withdrawal. Because some individuals cannot be maintained on OAT, research is needed on ways to withdraw patients from opioids more safely, comfortably, and quickly to facilitate transition to injectable naltrexone. Research is also needed on interventions to encourage participation in mutual help groups and on standardizing and improving access, including online and virtual formats. Additional well‑designed studies, including RCTs, are needed to evaluate screening for drug use disorders in primary care and screening's effect on enrollment in treatment and other outcomes.

The Work Group "recommends against the use of cannabis or cannabis derivatives in treating patients with PTSD because of the lack of well-designed RCTs evaluating the efficacy of cannabis derivatives in large samples of individuals with PTSD and the serious side effects associated with their use" and cites randomized evidence that "found no significant difference in change in PTSD symptom severity between active cannabis concentrations and placebo". Reported harms include that "marijuana impairs attention, memory, IQ, and driving ability, and early and persistent use has been associated with the emergence of psychosis", "adverse psychiatric outcomes associated with marijuana use in patients with PTSD — including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and substance misuse", and "possible treatment-related serious events, such as suicide attempts, paranoia, and agitation". "Patient preferences vary significantly regarding this treatment", yet "significant unknowns are related to resource use, acceptability, and feasibility regarding cannabis use (e.g. CBD or THC ratio, cost, dose, dosage form, route of administration, legality)", and "The Work Group found no new evidence related to this recommendation in the current systematic evidence review and used the assessment of the evidence from the 2017 VA/DoD PTSD CPG".

### State of the art treatments for cannabis dependence [^115YufEk]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of cannabis dependence can be viewed as a cup half empty or half full. On the one hand, few people who might benefit from treatment actually receive it. Among those who undergo treatment in randomized trials, long-term abstinence is achieved by fewer than 20%. Moderate use goals have been associated with decreases in consequences, but the differential impact of such goals on the long-term course of cannabis dependence is unknown. Optimal duration of treatment is unclear, and certain populations, particularly patients with co-occurring disorders, have not been studied adequately. Twelve-step programs are low cost, effective for other substance use disorders, and readily available in most regions of the world. However, their role and efficacy in cannabis dependence has not been examined. Finally, effective pharmacologic treatments are under development, but none have yet been firmly established. On the other hand, psychotherapeutic strategies used to treat other substance use disorders can be effective for cannabis dependence. A recent meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions for illicit substance use disorders found that treatments for cannabis dependence had comparatively larger effect sizes than treatments for other substance use disorders. Combination therapies have proven most effective, particularly those that begin with a motivational intervention, utilize incentives to enhance the commitment to change, and teach behavioral and cognitive copings skills to prevent relapse. Among adolescents, family engagement and collaboration with community stakeholders adds substantial value. Although only 9% of cannabis users develop cannabis dependence, the volume of people who smoke cannabis ensures that the total number of people in need of help is larger than the capacity of substance abuse specialty services. Thus, although efforts to refine and improve the efficacy of treatment interventions continue, innovations that increase the availability and accessibility of treatment are also needed. Computer- and phone-based interventions, social media, and brief interventions that can be implemented in primary care settings are areas that may hold promise for reaching at-risk populations. Adolescents and persons with co-occurring mental illness are at particularly high risk of cannabis dependence, and may suffer disproportionately from cannabis's adverse effects. As in the treatment of other substance use disorders, there is a need for a continuing care model with long-term follow-up that extends past the periods typically evaluated in treatment studies. Additionally, there is a need for further investigation of genetic underpinnings and endophenotypes underlying cannabis dependence to identify neurobiological mechanisms for targeted intervention. One benefit of the societal focus on cannabis has been a prominent increase in research covering everything from the basic science to public health impact of cannabis. Over the next decade, physicians who provide treatment for individuals with cannabis dependence are likely to see their armamentarium of effective interventions expand, to the ultimate betterment of patients, their families, and society at large.

### Medical cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain: a clinical practice guideline [^112c2XYj]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the role of medical cannabis or cannabinoids for people living with chronic pain due to cancer or non-cancer causes?

Current Practice

Chronic pain is common and distressing and associated with considerable socioeconomic burden globally. Medical cannabis is increasingly used to manage chronic pain, particularly in jurisdictions that have enacted policies to reduce use of opioids; however, existing guideline recommendations are inconsistent, and cannabis remains illegal for therapeutic use in many countries.

Recommendation

The guideline expert panel issued a weak recommendation to offer a trial of non-inhaled medical cannabis or cannabinoids, in addition to standard care and management (if not sufficient), for people living with chronic cancer or non-cancer pain.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including patients, clinicians with content expertise, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

This recommendation is informed by a linked series of four systematic reviews summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms, as well as patient values and preferences, regarding medical cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain.

Understanding The Recommendation

The recommendation is weak because of the close balance between benefits and harms of medical cannabis for chronic pain. It reflects a high value placed on small to very small improvements in self reported pain intensity, physical functioning, and sleep quality, and willingness to accept a small to modest risk of mostly self limited and transient harms. Shared decision making is required to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and personal context. Further research is warranted and may alter this recommendation.

### Patient experience and perspective on medical cannabis as an alternative for musculoskeletal pain management [^113tu7Pt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that medical cannabis patients perceived this drug (ie, cannabis) as an effective pain management alternative for musculoskeletal pain based on their NRS reported scores. In addition, most participants perceived medical cannabis as a better alternative than narcotics to attain adequate pain control.

Opioids Pandemic: Could Medical Cannabis Be a Potential Alternative?

Currently, the dependence and abuse of opioids are a growing dilemma. It has been estimated that 150 million opioids are prescribed annually in the United States, an increasing problem over the past 20 years. Owing to their potent analgesic properties, opioids have been the drug of choice by orthopaedic surgeons to manage postoperative pain. Despite their known risks, avoiding opioid use has been a challenge because of the high pain rates in the postoperative period. Therefore, exploring effective and safer alternatives is crucial to fighting the opioid pandemic.

Medical cannabis is a promising alternative for replacing opioids. Owing to its theoretical anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, this group of compounds (ie, cannabinoids) represents a potential pain management strategy.

Current Applications of Medical Cannabis

Cannabis is a drug that has become increasingly popular in recent years. Despite their Schedule 1 drug category, it is important to note that certain states have legalized both recreational and medicinal use of cannabis. Knowing the most common reasons for cannabis use can provide valuable information about the most common tendencies for using this drug and further determine its effectiveness. In a study done by Cahill et al, the most common diseases for which the participants reported cannabis use were anxiety (15.4%), followed by posttraumatic stress disorder (15%), rheumatoid conditions (13.1%), sleep disorders (12.6%), and degenerative disk disorders (10.3%) among others. In a cross-sectional study by Lucas et al, chronic pain (29.4%) was the most common indication for medical cannabis use, followed by mental health conditions (27%), insomnia (9.7%), musculoskeletal conditions (9.4%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (4.6%) among others. Those results have certain similarities to our findings, where the most common reasons for medical cannabis use were anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and muscle spasms. Moreover, chronic pain (88%) (ie, knee pain, back pain, and neck pain) was the most common reason in the musculoskeletal disorders subgroup.

### Understanding your risk for cannabis use disorder… [^112pkNeV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Some people who use cannabis will develop cannabis use disorder, meaning that they are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing health and social problems in their lives.
- The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is greater in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently. Signs of cannabis use disorder Fast Statistics
- Approximately 3 in 10 people who use cannabis have cannabis use disorder.
- It is estimated that people who use cannabis have about a 30% likelihood of becoming addicted.
- The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is greater in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently.

The following are signs of cannabis use disorder:

- Using more cannabis than intended
- Trying but failing to quit using cannabis
- Spending a lot of time using cannabis
- Craving cannabis
- Using cannabis even though it causes problems at home, school, or work
- Continuing to use cannabis despite social or relationship problems
- Giving up important activities with friends and family in favor of using cannabis
- Using cannabis in high-risk situations, such as while driving a car
- Continuing to use cannabis despite physical or psychological problems
- Needing to use more cannabis to get the same high. People who have cannabis use disorder may also be at a higher risk of other negative consequences, such as problems with attention, memory, and learning. Cannabis use disorder and increased THC concentration Some people who have cannabis use disorder may need to use more and more cannabis or greater concentrations of cannabis over time to experience a "high.

" The greater the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis, the stronger the effects the cannabis may have on the brain. The amount of THC in cannabis has increased over the past few decades. Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain are exposed to high concentrations of THC or how recent increases in concentrations affect the risk of someone developing cannabis use disorder. There is moderate evidence that high THC concentration cannabis use by adolescents and young adults is associated with continued use and development of future mental health symptoms and disorders.
