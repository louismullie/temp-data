## Question

What causes elevated chloride and low carbon dioxide in blood

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes elevated chloride and low carbon dioxide in blood. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low carbon dioxide" on a basic metabolic panel actually represents. Then, I should verify the acid–base pattern implied by high chloride with low total CO2. Next, I will categorize the major etiologies into iatrogenic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine/pharmacologic, and critical illness contexts. After that, I should review the underlying pathophysiology, including the anion gap and Stewart's strong ion difference. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, pitfalls, and a practical diagnostic approach with key differentiators and management principles.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory interpretation. On a basic metabolic panel, "total CO2" reflects serum bicarbonate plus dissolved CO2, so a low total CO2 generally indicates metabolic acidosis rather than a primary respiratory disturbance, which would change PaCO2 on a blood gas rather than total CO2 on a chem panel [^62f5f180] [^95bfdfc1].

> Wait, let me verify the acid–base pattern. Elevated chloride with low total CO2 is the classic signature of a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, also called hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, where bicarbonate falls and chloride rises to maintain electroneutrality; the anion gap remains normal because the lost bicarbonate is replaced by chloride rather than unmeasured organic anions [^049b8541] [^bbce60bd].

> I will now examine iatrogenic causes, which are common and preventable. Large-volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline drives hyperchloremia and lowers the strong ion difference, producing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis; this is well documented in perioperative and critical care cohorts and is a key reason balanced crystalloids are favored in many settings [^e3121784] [^064f7e81] [^31153fdc]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude; studies show a dose–response relationship between chloride load and acidosis, and in pediatrics, hyperchloremia emerges within hours of saline-heavy DKA resuscitation, sometimes masking ketone clearance and prolonging apparent acidosis [^85e381a0] [^8bbd5f38].

> Next, I should review renal etiologies. Renal tubular acidosis, both distal and proximal types, causes bicarbonate wasting with preserved or increased chloride reabsorption, yielding hyperchloremic, non–anion gap acidosis; this is particularly prevalent in critically ill patients and should be suspected when urine acidification is impaired or when the urine osmolal gap is low despite acidosis [^1ce651b7] [^f317a33b] [^601e5fd2]. Let me consider chronic kidney disease as well; as nephron mass declines, ammoniagenesis and net acid excretion fall, producing a non–anion gap acidosis that is often hyperchloremic in earlier CKD stages before anion gap rises in advanced disease [^593d217f].

> I need to check gastrointestinal causes next. Bicarbonate loss from diarrhea, nasogastric suction, fistulas, or ureteral diversion leads to chloride retention and hyperchloremic acidosis; the urine osmolal gap is typically high in these extrarenal bicarbonate losses, helping distinguish them from RTA when renal function is preserved [^1d4d0488] [^601e5fd2].

> Hold on, I should verify endocrine and pharmacologic contributors. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate and zonisamide cause renal bicarbonate wasting and dose-dependent hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis; FDA labeling documents frequent bicarbonate decrements and advises monitoring, especially with concomitant acidosis-prone conditions or drugs [^fb1ba6e6] [^a22fd2a8] [^c073c6bb]. I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors directly cause hyperchloremic acidosis, but wait, let me reconsider; the mechanism is more often mixed, with euglycemic ketoacidosis plus renal bicarbonate losses that can yield a prominent hyperchloremic component in some cases, so I should frame SGLT2-associated acidosis as a potential contributor rather than a pure non–anion gap process [^7897de45] [^4d2aa417].

> Let me think about critical illness dynamics. In septic shock and other low-flow states, early lactic acidosis may evolve into hyperchloremic acidosis as resuscitation progresses and chloride accumulates; partitioning base excess using Stewart methods shows a transition from unmeasured anions to chloride dominance over the first 24–48 hours, which can mislead clinicians if they rely on static measures like base deficit alone [^85e381a0] [^c1b1078d]. I should double-check that this pattern is linked to chloride load from fluids and correlates with delayed acidosis resolution unless chloride is cleared or bicarbonate is supplemented in select contexts [^85e381a0].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. In the traditional model, bicarbonate loss is offset by chloride retention to preserve electroneutrality, yielding a normal anion gap. In the Stewart framework, a decrease in the strong ion difference (SID = [Na⁺] + [K⁺] − [Cl⁻]) increases hydrogen ion concentration and lowers bicarbonate, which mechanistically explains why hyperchloremia alone can acidify without added organic acids [^049b8541] [^61477d94]. But wait, what if the anion gap is not truly normal? I need to ensure I correct the anion gap for albumin and consider mixed disorders, because hypoalbuminemia or concomitant high–anion gap processes can obscure the expected pattern [^bbce60bd].

> I should confirm clinical implications and pitfalls. Hyperchloremic acidosis is not benign; it is associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and possibly worse outcomes in some settings, though causality remains debated and mortality signals are inconsistent across studies; nonetheless, repeated observations link high-chloride fluids to AKI and acidosis, supporting cautious fluid selection and chloride monitoring in at-risk patients [^e3121784] [^064f7e81] [^0f7bfcae]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some data suggest mortality differences are driven more by lactate or unmeasured anions than by chloride per se, so I should interpret chloride in the context of the entire acid–base picture and the patient's trajectory [^4f31b984].

> Let me consider management principles and where bicarbonate fits. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause: stop chloride-heavy fluids, correct volume and perfusion, withdraw offending drugs, replace GI bicarbonate losses, and address renal dysfunction; in select cases, particularly persistent hyperchloremic acidosis with kidney injury, cautious sodium bicarbonate may be considered, but routine use in lactic acidosis is discouraged and benefits appear limited to specific phenotypes, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^c5e1b084] [^1ba8e990] [^afba4b67]. I should double-check dosing guidance; overcorrection can provoke alkalemia and other harms, so partial correction with reassessment is prudent when bicarbonate is used [^1c9e434a] [^685ce301].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach. First, confirm the pattern with a blood gas to document low bicarbonate and assess compensation. Then calculate the anion gap and correct it for albumin. If the gap is normal, evaluate for iatrogenic chloride load, GI bicarbonate losses, RTA using urine anion gap or osmolal gap and urine pH, and medication exposures. If the gap is high, consider mixed disorders and look for lactate, ketones, or toxins. In DKA, track the anion gap and chloride-corrected bicarbonate to distinguish resolving ketoacidosis from evolving hyperchloremic acidosis during treatment [^62f5f180] [^bbce60bd] [^8bbd5f38]. Hold on, I should verify that urine studies are interpreted in the context of renal function and that I do not overcall RTA in the setting of global renal failure or unmeasured urine anions [^601e5fd2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I flag special populations and nuances. In pediatrics, hyperchloremic acidosis is common during DKA treatment and can prolong apparent acidosis; monitoring chloride and using chloride-corrected bicarbonate helps avoid unnecessary insulin or bicarbonate. In CKD, target predialysis bicarbonate around 22 mmol/L balances acidosis correction against alkalosis risks. And in neurocritical care, while saline is often preferred for cerebral edema, balanced solutions may mitigate hyperchloremia when edema is not the dominant concern, so fluid choice should be individualized and dynamically adjusted [^8bbd5f38] [^ff562126] [^c5e1b084].

Elevated chloride with low CO2 (total CO2/bicarbonate) reflects **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** [^049b8541], most often from **chloride-rich fluids** (e.g. 0.9% saline) [^e3121784] or **renal bicarbonate loss** (e.g. renal tubular acidosis, diarrhea) [^1ce651b7] [^1d4d0488]. Other causes include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide) [^fb1ba6e6] [^c073c6bb], SGLT2 inhibitors [^7897de45], and chronic kidney disease [^593d217f]. The pattern arises when bicarbonate falls and chloride rises to maintain electroneutrality, yielding a normal anion gap [^bbce60bd]. Management targets the cause: stop chloride load, treat diarrhea, withdraw offending drugs, and consider bicarbonate for persistent acidosis [^ff562126] [^c1b1078d].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can lead to elevated chloride and low CO2 levels:

---

### Iatrogenic hyperchloremic acidosis

Large-volume administration of chloride-rich crystalloids (e.g. 0.9% saline) can cause **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** by increasing serum chloride and decreasing bicarbonate via the strong ion difference mechanism [^e3121784] [^f129989c]. This iatrogenic acidosis is common in critically ill patients receiving resuscitation fluids [^c1b1078d].

---

### Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)

RTA is characterized by impaired renal acid excretion, leading to **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** [^1ce651b7]. RTA can be classified into distal (type I), proximal (type II), and hypoaldosteronism-related (type IV) forms, each with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms [^e3fb5b89].

---

### Gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss

Chronic diarrhea, intestinal fistulas, or nasogastric suction can cause significant **bicarbonate loss**, leading to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis [^1d4d0488]. The loss of bicarbonate is compensated by an increase in serum chloride to maintain electroneutrality [^049b8541].

---

### Medications

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) inhibit renal bicarbonate reabsorption, causing **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis** [^fb1ba6e6] [^c073c6bb]. SGLT2 inhibitors can also cause mixed metabolic acidosis, including a hyperchloremic component [^7897de45].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, impaired renal acid excretion leads to **metabolic acidosis**, often hyperchloremic in early stages [^593d217f]. As CKD progresses, the anion gap may increase due to accumulation of organic acids [^593d217f].

---

## Clinical implications

Elevated chloride and low CO2 levels have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Acid-base imbalance**: Persistent metabolic acidosis can impair organ function, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems [^f8b034b1].

- **Renal effects**: Hyperchloremia has been associated with renal vasoconstriction, reduced renal blood flow, and increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) [^0f7bfcae] [^b4e552f8].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperchloremic acidosis often coexists with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, depending on the underlying cause [^1ce651b7].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach is essential to identify the **underlying cause**:

- **Confirm acid-base disturbance**: Measure arterial blood gases (ABG) to confirm metabolic acidosis and assess compensation [^62f5f180].

- **Calculate anion gap**: A normal anion gap (8–12 mEq/L) suggests hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, while an elevated anion gap indicates the presence of unmeasured anions (e.g. lactate, ketones) [^bbce60bd].

- **Evaluate renal function**: Assess renal function (eGFR, urine pH, urine anion gap) to differentiate between renal and non-renal causes [^03c010e1].

- **Review medication history**: Identify potential drug-induced causes (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors) [^fb1ba6e6] [^7897de45].

- **Assess gastrointestinal losses**: Evaluate for chronic diarrhea, fistulas, or nasogastric suction [^1d4d0488].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Iatrogenic hyperchloremic acidosis**: Stop or reduce chloride-rich fluid administration; consider balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) [^e3121784] [^31153fdc].

- **Renal tubular acidosis**: Treat underlying cause; administer alkali therapy (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate) to correct acidosis [^1ce651b7].

- **Gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss**: Address the source of bicarbonate loss (e.g. treat diarrhea, manage fistulas); provide supportive care and electrolyte replacement [^1d4d0488].

- **Medication-induced acidosis**: Discontinue offending medications (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide, SGLT2 inhibitors) and consider alternative therapies [^fb1ba6e6] [^c073c6bb] [^7897de45].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Manage CKD progression, dietary modifications, and consider alkali supplementation if indicated [^ff562126].

---

Elevated chloride and low CO2 levels reflect **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis**, with causes including iatrogenic factors, renal tubular acidosis, gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss, medications, and chronic kidney disease. A systematic diagnostic approach and targeted management are essential to address the underlying cause and prevent complications.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^049b8541]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO₃⁻ concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as Na⁺ − (HCO₃⁻ + Cl⁻), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^573f5591]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It's conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^65038273]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this study observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment did not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactic or non-lactic metabolic acidosis. However, regardless of lactate levels, it reduced the odds of mortality in patients with hyperchloremia, while increased the odds of mortality in non-hyperchloremic patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the causal benefit of bicarbonate in hyperchloremic acidosis.

### Hyperchloremic acidosis in the critically ill: one of the strong-ion acidoses? [^61477d94]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Decreases in plasma bicarbonate are associated with hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis. According to the Stewart approach to acid-base physiology, the strong-ion difference regulates plasma bicarbonate, with chloride and lactate being the only strong anions routinely measured in clinical chemistry. We hypothesized that the plasma strong-ion difference, both with and without lactate, would have a stronger association with plasma bicarbonate than plasma chloride alone would have with bicarbonate. We used plasma acid-base data from 300 critically ill patients. The correlation with bicarbonate became progressively weaker (P < 0.001): all measured strong ions, r = 0.60; measured strong ions without lactate, r = 0.42; chloride alone, r = -0.27. In a subgroup of 26 patients with traditional hyperchloremic acidosis (base excess < -2 mmol/L and anion gap < 17 mmol/L), the measured strong-ion difference (without lactate) had a stronger correlation (P < 0.001) with bicarbonate than chloride had: r = 0.85 versus r = -0.60. We conclude that hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis are strong-ion acidoses. Hyperchloremia should be viewed relative to the plasma strong cations. A practical conclusion is that both managing and preventing acid-base disorders with IV fluid therapy involves manipulating each of the plasma strong ions, particularly sodium and chloride.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^8b39a269]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood PCO₂ owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated HCO₃⁻ levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f022dd9b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic acidosis revealed that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival outcomes for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have lactic acidosis or non-lactic acidosis. However, it was observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively reduces the mortality risk of patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L) in both types of patients, while it increases the mortality risk of patients without hyperchloremia (chloride < 107 mmol/L). This indicates that the level of lactate does not influence the impact of chloride levels on sodium bicarbonate treatment.

Among non-LA patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, there was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality risk between patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment after matching and those who did not. This is because the mortality rate of non-LA patients themselves is relatively low, and the reduction in sample size after matching leads to a decrease in statistical power. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment was still lower. Findings of this study suggest that in pediatric metabolic acidosis, if chloride is markedly elevated, sodium bicarbonate therapy might be considered even if lactate is high. Whereas if chloride is normal, clinicians should be more cautious and ensure other treatments are prioritized.

The categorization of metabolic acidosis patients based on the presence of lactic acidosis divides them into two groups with potentially distinct acidosis mechanisms. There is a considerable difference in the acidic components contributing to pH reduction in these two group patients. In vitro cytological studies have demonstrated that the body's response to acidosis induced by lactate or hydrochloric acid involves different cytokine reactions, suggesting that the response to and harm caused by various acid components may vary. Research on prognostic indicators for patients has shown that the severity of acidosis, as measured by pH or standard base excess, is not independently linked to hospital mortality when controlling for the causal anion (lactate, chloride, or others). The anion causing the metabolic acidosis may play a more significant role in determining outcomes than the pH itself. Different levels or categories of causal anions can result in significantly diverse prognoses, although the importance of the acidosis cause has been emphasized in previous research. Nevertheless, this study found that sodium bicarbonate can decrease the mortality risk in patients with both lactic and non-lactic acidosis with hyperchloremia. This suggests that the mechanism of action of sodium bicarbonate may not be dependent on the components causing the acidosis and is effective in correcting acidosis resulting from multiple pathological mechanisms in hyperchloremia.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^fc20e780]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The acid secretion is completed by the kidneys in the intercalated cells of the late distal tubule and collecting duct, where hydrogen ions are produced by catalyzing the dissolution of carbon dioxide through carbonic anhydrase. Hydrogen ions and potassium ions are exchanged into the tubular lumen. Most of the excreted uric acid is neutralized by ammonium ions, forming ammonium chloride secretion, while releasing bicarbonate into the plasma, effectively exchanging chloride for bicarbonate. If hyperchloremia or bicarbonate loss occurs, the kidneys need time to recover from this deficiency through renal tubular acid excretion. When hyperchloremia and bicarbonate loss occur simultaneously (which happens to be the case with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis), there is not enough bicarbonate exchange chloride, leading to further accumulation of chloride ions in the blood and increasing the risk of death. Supplementing exogenous bicarbonate enables the smooth exchange and elimination of chloride compounds, restoring the balance of hydrogen-potassium ion exchange, and thus correcting acidosis. This may be one of the mechanisms by which sodium bicarbonate is effective in treating hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recently, it has also found that hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis potentially benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy in adult patients. It is crucial to note the limitations of this study when interpreting the results. Firstly, this is a single-center retrospective analysis with all patients being children. secondly, the treatment measures for other abnormal acid–base balance parameters were not disclosed. Several other potential confounding factors, such as organ function, have not been comprehensively accounted for. Again, lactic acidosis is divided into type A, which occurs when there is reduced oxygen delivery to tissues from severe hypoxemia or reduced perfusion, and type B, which is due to impaired mitochondrial function, which this study was unable to differentiate.

### Topiramate [^fb1ba6e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^ad1330df]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO₂/HCO₃⁻ and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Physiological effects of hyperchloraemia and acidosis [^c766b6af]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The advent of balanced solutions for i.v. fluid resuscitation and replacement is imminent and will affect any specialty involved in fluid management. Part of the background to their introduction has focused on the non-physiological nature of 'normal' saline solution and the developing science about the potential problems of hyperchloraemic acidosis. This review assesses the physiological significance of hyperchloraemic acidosis and of acidosis in general. It aims to differentiate the effects of the causes of acidosis from the physiological consequences of acidosis. It is intended to provide an assessment of the importance of hyperchloraemic acidosis and thereby the likely benefits of balanced solutions.

### Hyperchloremia is associated with poor renal outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting [^b4e552f8]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chloride is an important anion in the extracellular fluid of humans. It accounts for approximately one-third of the tonicity and two-thirds of negatively charged ions in the plasma. It plays a key role in the maintenance of acid-base balance and fluid homeostasis. The present study focused on hyperchloremia in patients undergoing CABG because it has been associated with worse outcomes in other medical conditions. Patients with hyperchloremia had higher risks of AKI and ESRD than those with normochloremia. This relationship was not affected by the death risk of patients. These results have clinical implications because serum chloride has merit in terms of easy and early measurement during the perioperative period.

Dyschloremia is identified in 25–45% of critically ill patients. Temporary hyperchloremia occurs more frequently than hypochloremia, specifically in up to 75% of critically ill patients during the first 24 h of hospital stay. Hyperchloremia is primarily attributable to the loss of bicarbonates via gastrointestinal and renal paths. Additionally, it can be caused by dilution of bicarbonates through loading of fluids with a low bicarbonate concentration and excess infusion of chloride-rich fluids.

The physiological function of chloride includes regulation of extracellular and intracellular volume and acid-base homeostasis. However, the pathophysiological role of abnormal chlorides is insufficiently understood because serum chloride levels have been less focused on in clinical or mechanistic studies. One study with 1940 septic patients found that hyperchloremia or its worsening trend was associated with high mortality. Another study with 1221 critically ill patients revealed that hyperchloremia was prevalent during AKI compared to non-AKI. This association was also identified in 1267 patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage, wherein an increase in serum chloride, but not sodium, was associated with AKI. Although electrolyte imbalance is frequent in patients undergoing CABG, no studies have confirmed the relationship between hyperchloremia and the risk of AKI and ESRD before the present study. This issue is important because both AKI and ESRD worsen the overall outcome and quality of life after CABG.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f747e88c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of alkaline agents to correct acidosis in pediatric patients is common in clinical practice, with sodium bicarbonate being a widely used alkaline drug. However, it is concerning that the results of multi-center randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews suggest that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve overall patient survival. Treating metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the absence of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.15) not only lacks benefits but may also be harmful.

Chloride plays a crucial role in acid–base balance and metabolism. Plasma pH results from kidney bicarbonate synthesis and excretion of chloride, maintaining the homeostatic balance of the blood CO2/bicarbonate buffer. Bicarbonate deficiency and chloride excess are essentially two sides of the same coin. Theoretically, it is reasonable to assume that sodium bicarbonate treatment could benefit patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Promisingly, recent findings of Liu et al. have supported this hypothesis regarding pediatric patients' survival for the first time. They identified that sodium bicarbonate treatment significantly improves the survival rate of metabolic acidosis patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L). Still, it increases the risk of death in non-hyperchloremic (chloride < 107 mmol/L) metabolic acidosis patients.

Lactic acidosis is a common form of metabolic acidosis, representing half of all cases. Elevated lactate levels strongly correlate with mortality. Research indicates that mortality rates are twice as high in lactic acidosis cases compared to those without, which has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Therefore, building on the work conducted by Liu et al. this study aimed to analyze the prognosis of pediatric patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and its interaction with chloride levels by classifying them into two subgroups: lactic acidosis and non-lactic acidosis.

### Hyperchloremia and prolonged acidosis during treatment for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^8bbd5f38]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap secondary to ketonemia. Intravenous hydration fluids used in treatment can cause chloride overload, leading to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HMA). The development of HMA can lead to the persistence of acidosis despite the resolution of ketonemia.

Methods

A total of 178 DKA episodes in 153 patients treated between January 2013 and October 2023 were included in the study. Creatine-based glomerular filtration rate and HbA1c value at admission and venous blood gas parameters (pH, actual bicarbonate, base deficit), anion gap, chloride-corrected bicarbonate, nonchloride base deficit, and sodium and chloride measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours were evaluated.

Results

Hyperchloremia was detected in 69.3% of participants and developed at a mean of 6.3 (± 4.3) hours of treatment. The incidence of hyperchloremia increased with the duration of treatment; the rates were 8.4%, 51.3%, 65%, 76.2%, 75.5%, and 80% at 0, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 hours of treatment, respectively. The group with hyperchloremia had more severe acidosis, a higher HbA1c value, and a longer resolution time. At the 12th hour of treatment, acidosis continued based on pH and HCO₃ levels, whereas the hyperchloremia group exhibited a low anion gap (mean 12.8). At the 6th hour of treatment, the resolution rates were significantly lower in the hyperchloremia group based on the pH and HCO₃ levels but increased when assessed by chloride-corrected HCO₃ and anion gap.

Conclusions

During treatment of DKA, monitoring anion gap, blood ketones, and Cl⁻/Na⁺ ratio or using regression equations in addition to routine acid-base parameters may help differentiate DKA from HMA and prevent prolonged intravenous treatment.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^a22fd2a8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^dd451797]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### Meta-analysis of high-versus low-chloride content in perioperative and critical care fluid resuscitation [^44047ed4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Among the four eligible studies, reporting transfusion outcomes, all reported at least a small or modest, increase in transfusion volume with high-chloride fluid administration. Shaw and co-workersalso demonstrated an association between high-chloride fluids and greater transfusion volume, but the study was not included in the analysis owing to lack of variability data. Although the total number of patients included in the present meta-analysis of blood transfusion volume was low (high-chloride, 102; low-chloride, 100), the potential for a true difference raises relevant questions. Clinicians may consider any difference meaningful given the expense and risks associated with red cell transfusions. Although causality has not been established between high-chloride fluids and increased transfusion, the potential clinical impact of a true effect is hypothesis-generating.

When administered in large volumes, 0.9 per cent saline has been shown to cause coagulopathy. Total volumes of fluid administered did not vary substantially between the groups (Table S3, supporting information), suggesting that dilutional coagulopathy does not account for the observed differences in transfusion. Mechanisms of saline-induced coagulopathy are not fully known, and the data lead us to consider whether hyperchloraemia/acidosis has an independent effect on coagulation. Alternatively, a reverse association cannot be excluded, in that fewer transfusions may have been administered in the low-chloride groups owing to the possibility of incompatibility with citrated blood. However, in two, of the four studies, the low-chloride solution did not contain calcium, and in oneof the other studies the providers were blinded to the fluid that was being administered.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^916d9c32]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition that many people in the Western world have but do not realise it. It occurs when there is retention of acid in the body, which leads to a depletion in the bicarbonate stores of the body. The term metabolic acidosis is typically used when referring to low blood pH or acidemia due to a metabolic abnormality. However, this is inappropriate as most cases of metabolic acidosis do not have acidemia. In fact, a low blood pH is typically one of the last surrogate markers to become abnormal in those with low-grade metabolic acidosis. This is because the body maintains a normal blood pH at the expense of bicarbonate reserves. Metabolic acidosis primarily occurs inside the cell and in the fluid that surrounds our tissues (interstitial fluid). When checking for metabolic acidosis the clinician should look at fasting serum bicarbonate, urinary pH (with a measurement at least 4 hours separated from the last ingested meal) and 24-hour urinary citrate levels. While there is not a universally accepted way to diagnose low-grade metabolic acidosis, this paper will help to give the clinician insights into checking for this condition in their patients.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^03c010e1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Zonisamide [^c073c6bb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^bbce60bd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Approach to the hemodialysis patient with an abnormal serum bicarbonate concentration [^e6b183e4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We present a patient receiving hemodialysis with a persistently high serum bicarbonate concentration to illustrate the evaluation and management issues for patients with both high (> 25 mEq/L) and low (< 20 mEq/L) pretreatment values. Patients with high serum bicarbonate concentrations typically are malnourished and have low rates of endogenous acid production. Evaluation should begin with assessment of whether an acute and potentially reversible cause of metabolic alkalosis is present. If not, management should be directed at treating malnutrition. By contrast, patients with low predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations, in the absence of an acute and reversible cause, may benefit from increasing the level by an adjustment in dialysate bicarbonate concentration. However, the level at which one should intervene and to what extent serum bicarbonate concentration should be increased are unresolved issues. Whether such an intervention will reduce mortality risk has not been determined.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^f1b028e8]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

A study on 22,851 surgical patients with normal preoperative serum chloride concentration and renal function demonstrated a 22% incidence of acute postoperative hyperchloremia (serum chloride > 110 mmol/l). Of the 4955 patients with hyperchloremia after surgery, 4266 (85%) patients were propensity matched with an equal number of patients who had normochloremia postoperatively. Patients with hyperchloremia were at increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality (3.0 vs. 1.9% odds ratio (95% CI): 1.58 (1.25 to 1.98)) and had a longer median hospital stay (7.0 days (interquartile range 4.1–12.3) vs. 6.3 days (interquartile range 4.0–11.3), P < 0.01) than those with normal postoperative serum chloride concentrations. Patients with postoperative hyperchloremia were also more likely to have postoperative renal dysfunction as defined by a > 25% decrease in GFR (12.9 vs. 9.2%, P < 0.01). Contrary to what was previously believed, this studyhas shown that hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is not a benign, self-limiting, metabolic disturbance.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^c1b1078d]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Common types of metabolic acidosis in the ICU

The causes of acute metabolic acidosis are diverse in critically ill patients. DKA, lactic acidosis, and hyperchloremic acidosis are responsible for most cases of severe metabolic acidosis cases due to a decreased SID.

DKA is a medical emergency in patients with diabetes mellitus as a result of insulin deficiency. The hepatic metabolism of fatty acids produces beta- hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, strong anions in the human body. As hyperglycemia induces osmotic diuresis, patients with DKA have a markedly reduced extracellular fluid volume. The available evidence was summarized in a review that revealed the paucity of sufficient data on clinical impact. To date, a comprehensive epidemiological study on DKA investigating its epidemiology and clinical outcomes is still lacking.

Lactate is a strong anion in the human body as more than 99% of lactate is ionized. Lactic acidosis is observed in cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, severe heart failure, severe trauma, and sepsis, with high mortality rates, ranging from 30 to 88% depending on the definition used. The mortality of patients with lactic acidosis was reportedly the highest (56%) amongst patients with metabolic acidosis defined by a SBE (standard base excess) < -2 mEq/l.

Recently, hyperchloremic acidosis caused by intravenous fluid products has become widely known and is reported in 19% to 45% of patients in the ICU. Table 1 shows the electrolytes and SIDs of intravenous fluid products commonly used in the ICU. Theoretically, acidosis occurs when intravenous fluid products with a SID lower than that of the patient's plasma are administered. Balanced crystalloids, i.e. Ringer's acetate, Ringer's lactate, and Plasmalyte, contain acetate, lactate, or gluconate to replace chloride. Those strong anions do not contribute to SID as they are metabolized by the liver faster than renal chloride excretion.

### Renal tubular acidosis [^1ce651b7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in poorly thriving young children with hyperchloremic and hypokalemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, with/without syndromic features. Further workup is needed to determine the type of renal tubular acidosis and the presumed etiopathogenesis, which informs treatment choices and prognosis. The risk of nephrolithiasis and calcinosis is linked to the presence (proximal renal tubular acidosis, negligible stone risk) or absence (distal renal tubular acidosis, high stone risk) of urine citrate excretion. New formulations of slow-release alkali and potassium combination supplements are being tested that are expected to simplify treatment and lead to sustained acidosis correction.

Defining metabolic acidosis

Acidemia, or too much acid in the blood, only occurs when the body's buffering capacity can no longer maintain a normal pH level. A normal blood pH is considered to be 7.35–7.45. However, even at a normal blood pH metabolic acidosis can occur. In fact, once the blood pH falls below 7.4, there is usually acid retention in the body and low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, the blood pH does not drop below the normal range until metabolic acidosis has become severe. Once this occurs it is usually referred to as 'metabolic acidosis' by the clinician. However, this is actually acidemia (or too much acid in the blood). Thus, someone with a low blood pH has likely had low-grade metabolic acidosis for years or more likely decades.

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is something that many people in the Western world have. Low-grade means there are no apparent or noticeable harms but the body is retaining acid, depleting bicarbonate stores and damage is occurring in numerous tissues in the body. Typically, with low-grade metabolic acidosis, the blood pH drops slightly, as does the bicarbonate levels, but they will still be in the 'normal' range. Thus, if blood pH and/or bicarbonate levels are at the lower end of normal this is highly suggestive that someone has metabolic acidosis.

With low-grade metabolic acidosis, the total blood buffering capacity is reduced and thus a greater reliance on muscle, bone and connective tissue will be required for the elimination of additional acid. The harms of low-grade metabolic acidosis increase with age and decreasing kidney function as the kidneys ability to excrete acid goes down. The increase in the acid load in the body worsens kidney function over the long run. For example, chronic metabolic acidosis leads to nephron hypertrophy in the kidneys of animals. This is likely due to the toxic effects that ammonia has on the kidneys. Metabolic acidosis can also lead to an increased loss of sodium and potassium in the urine, as well as an increased loss of water increasing the risk of dehydration. In addition, metabolic acidosis can cause magnesium and calcium loss out the urine.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^593d217f]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology leading to acidosis in CKD

Under normal conditions, the extracellular H + concentration is tightly regulated and varies little from the normal value of approximately 40 nanomol/L. Regulation of acid–base homeostasis involves three basic steps: chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers, alteration of alveolar ventilation, and changes in renal H + excretion. The kidneys regulate H⁺ excretion by reabsorbing filtered HCO₃⁻ and generating new HCO₃⁻ in response to various stimuli. Secreted H⁺ combine with urinary buffers such as HPO₄²⁻ and ammonia. In CKD the reduction in functioning nephrons causes defects in renal excretion of acid, mainly in the form of ammonium. A fraction of patients may have inappropriate bicarbonate wasting in the urine.

The acidosis in CKD usually remains relatively stable. In uncomplicated acidosis, the serum bicarbonate levels typically are > 12 mEq/L and blood pH is > 7.2. There are two general possibilities for this stabilization of serum bicarbonate levels. One is that after an initial period of acid retention, the excretion and production of acid equalize. The other possibility is that acidosis evokes extrarenal mechanisms that dispose of the endogenous acid not excreted in the urine. The major source of such buffering would be base derived from bone. Carefully conducted balance studies in CKD patients with acidosis found a positive acid balance of approximately 10–20 mEq per day and negative calcium balance that improved with correction of acidosis. However, the degree of acid retention has been debated, with the suggestion that these findings resulted from systematic measurement error. While the magnitude of acid retention may be less than reported, it seems likely that acid production does exceed excretion in the setting of chronic renal acidosis.

The acidosis in mild to moderate CKD is predominantly hyperchloremic, with an increased anion gap observed variably and generally only with advanced CKD. However, accounting for changes in serum albumin and other electrolytes in the anion gap calculation reveals a slightly more nuanced view. This maneuver reveals minor elevations in the anion gap, which are associated with decrements in serum bicarbonate, even in the CKD stage 2 eGFR range. Although small, these differences in anion gap are independently associated with mortality. Thus, there may be low-level accumulation of organic solutes even when the GFR is relatively preserved that partially accounts for changes in the serum bicarbonate level.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders in humans: a laboratory medicine perspective [^b35edbec]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic errors affect patient management, and as blood gas analysis is mainly performed without the laboratory, users must be aware of the potential pitfalls. The aim was to provide a summary of common issues users should be aware of. A narrative review was performed using online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and reference lists of identified papers. Language was limited to English. Errors can be pre-analytical, analytical or post-analytical. Samples should be analysed within 15min and kept at room temperature and taken at least 15–30 min after changes to inspired oxygen and ventilator settings, for accurate oxygen measurement. Plastic syringes are more oxygen permeable if chilled. Currently, analysers run arterial, venous, capillary and intraosseous samples, but variations in reference intervals may not be appreciated or reported. Analytical issues can arise from interference secondary to drugs, such as spurious hyperchloraemia with salicylate and hyperlactataemia with ethylene glycol, or pathology, such as spurious hypoxaemia with leucocytosis and alkalosis in hypoalbuminaemia. Interpretation is complicated by result adjustment, for example, temperature (alpha-stat adjustment may overestimate partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂) in hypothermia, for example), and inappropriate reference intervals, for example, in pregnancy bicarbonate, and PCO₂ ranges should be lowered. Lack of appreciation for patient-specific and circumstance-specific reference intervals, including extremes of age and altitude, and transformation of measurements to standard conditions can lead to inappropriate assumptions. It is vitally important for users to optimise specimen collection, appreciate the analytical methods and understand when reference intervals are applicable to their specimen type, clinical question or patient.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^31153fdc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis

Lactic acidosis is a major metabolic side effect of sepsis. As noted above, intravenous administration of 0.9% saline may cause iatrogenic hyperchloremic acidosis. Hyperchloremia has been associated with increase in mortality in both septic and non-septic patients. However, most studies examining this issue were retrospective, which precludes derivation of a meaningful causative association between the two. Studies comparing solutions with high versus low-chloride concentrations have yielded conflicting results thus far. Reduced rates of mortality and AKI have been described with balanced solutions therefore until more information from RCTs is available, balanced solutions remain preferred over 0.9% saline for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable septic patients.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f7c5b2ea]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium bicarbonate is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients, yet its efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to assess its effectiveness in treating non-lactic and lactic metabolic acidosis and its impact at various chloride levels.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by screening pediatric patients diagnosed with metabolic acidosis from a paediatric intensive care database. Patients were categorized into two groups: lactate patients (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) and non-lactate patients (lactate ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). The risk of death in patients who received sodium bicarbonate was assessed.

Results

Sodium bicarbonate treatment did not significantly affect in-hospital mortality in either overall lactate patients or non-lactate patients, with adjusted OR of 1.044 (95% CI: 0.829–1.315, p = 0.714) and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.548–1.281, p = 0.414), respectively. In lactate patients, those receiving sodium bicarbonate had a higher risk of in-hospital death when chloride was < 107 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.536–3.135, p < 0.001), whereas the risk of in-hospital death decreased when chloride was ≥ 113 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 0.365, 95% CI: 0.217–0.614, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in non-lactate patients.

Conclusions

Sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactate or non-lactate metabolic acidosis. However, it can reduce the odds of mortality in pediatric patients with hyperchloremia, regardless of their lactate levels. Prospective studies are needed to further confirm these findings.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^39d12837]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

It is the slow depletion in our body's buffering systems that keeps our blood pH normal despite acid overload. Thus, some individuals can have a normal blood pH level and a fully functioning buffering system in the body, whereas others can have a normal blood pH but their buffering systems are deficient. An accumulated of acid in the cell and/or the interstitial fluid can lead to cellular damage, pain and insulin resistance.

One buffering system in the body is bicarbonate. This system is the primary buffering system in the blood, and it helps to maintain a normal blood pH. Typically, serum bicarbonate levels drop prior to blood pH. Thus, measuring fasting serum bicarbonate levels is important when checking for low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, it should still be paired with several other tests. A normal serum bicarbonate level is considered 23–30 mEq/L. However, optimal serum bicarbonate levels are more around 25–30 mEq/L (preferably 27–30 mEq/L). A serum bicarbonate level at or below 24 mEq/L should be considered suboptimal and suggests low-grade metabolic acidosis, especially if paired with low urinary citrate or high urinary ammonium. A urinary pH of < 5.3 in adults or < 5.6 in children almost certainly indicates metabolic acidosis and is found in a large portion of the population. However, a urinary pH < 6.5 indicates a net acid excretion of > 40 mEq, which can lead to acid retention and metabolic acidosis in approximately 50% of the population. Thus, even a urinary pH of 6.5 or less can suggest low-grade metabolic acidosis. For most individuals, an optimal urinary pH is ~6.8–7.0, which signifies a net acid excretion of approximately zero. Box 1 summarises the ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis.

### Potassium chloride [^c8b2ead6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances or cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.

If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high-potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.

In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^1c9e434a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^c6c9b210]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis

Suboptimal fasting serum bicarbonate: < 27 mEq/L.
Optimal bicarbonate level: 27–32 mEq/L.
Optimal level prior to exercise: 31–38 mEq/L.
Suboptimal blood pH: < 7.42.
Optimal blood pH 7.42–7.45.
Optimal blood pH prior to exercise: 7.45–7.50.

High urinary ammonium (NH₄⁺): Normal range is 15–45 ug/dL. Optimal < 40 mmol/day. Urinary ammonium starts to fall when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops below 40 mL/min. Thus, 24-hour urinary ammonium levels are not an appropriate way to look for low-grade metabolic acidosis once the GFR is < 40 mL/min.
High 24-hour urinary calcium (compared with calcium intake) ~16.67% of dietary calcium gets excreted in the urine, so for a dietary calcium intake of 900 mg, 150 mg will typically come out in the urine. If more than 16.67% of dietary calcium is coming out in the urine this suggests calcium loss, which may be due to metabolic acidosis.
Low 24-hour urinary citrate < 320 mg/24 hours. Optimal urinary citrate level: 600–800 mg/24 hours.
Low urinary pH A urinary pH of < 6.0 is formed from a diet that produces a net acid excretion of 70 mEq/day or higher, which for most people will lead to acid retention. Optimal urinary pH (net acid excretion of zero): ~6.8–7.5. Urine pH should not be taken first thing in the morning or less than 4 hours from eating. Spot urinary pH should be taken 4 hours or longer after eating but not first thing in the morning. The best time to take a urinary spot pH would be before dinner (at least 4 hours after eating lunch).
Low partial pressure of carbon dioxide < 35 mm Hg. Suboptimal < 38 mm Hg.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^c94052eb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^f317a33b]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of RTA we first selected patients with hyperchloremic acidosis (43 of 100 patients; Figure 1). Thirty-one of this subgroup presented with a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with preserved renal function, which is characteristic for RTA (Figure 1). Thus, our data show for the first time that RTA was highly prevalent in critically ill patients with hyperchloremic acidosis, which is suggestive that RTA contributes to the pathophysiology of hyperchloremic acidosis in these patients.

Acidemia (arterial pH < 7.35) is associated with unfavorable outcome in critically ill patients, which may be pronounced by RTA. However, hyperchloremic acidemia is suggested to be less detrimental than lactic or ketoacidemia. Moreover, although there is strong evidence of the association between acidosis and poor outcome in critically ill patients, there is little evidence of causation. Mild (hyperchloremic) acidosis may even be a physiological response as oxygen delivery is enhanced via the Bohr effect.

In the present trial, RTA in combination with hyperchloremic acidosis was not associated with the outcome parameters lengths of ICU or hospital stay and ICU or hospital mortality.

Therefore, we hypothesize that RTA in combination with hyperchloremic acidosis in the present study is not a harmful condition, but may be a physiological response in the presence of several metabolic acid-base disorders at the same time (Figure 2).

Hyperchloremic acidosis is attributed to several causes. On the one hand, extrarenal bicarbonate loss may be based on diarrhea or via surgical drains. This is defined as a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg and was observed in 16% of the patients with hyperchloremic acidosis (7 of 43) in the present study (Figure 1). Markedly decreased renal function (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min) as a potential contributing factor to metabolic acidosis was seen in 12% (5 of 43) of the patients with hyperchloremic acidosis (Figure 1).

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^80ebf359]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of insulin resistance [^998a95c9]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis worsens glucose uptake, oxidation and insulin resistance

'Acidosis, with lowered pH and 'alkali reserve' of the body fluids, has numerous concomitant secondary effects. These interdependent effects include disturbances in normal activities of enzyme systems that are involved in many phases of carbohydrate and mineral metabolism, inhibition of insulin action, increased catabolism and decreased anabolism in tissues'. George M. Guest et al, 1952

Numerous studies show that the dietary acid load is associated with worsening of insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Lower bicarbonate levels (a marker of low-grade metabolic acidosis) are independently associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. In healthy participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999–2002, individuals with a serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L had a fasting insulin 12.7 pmol/L higher than those with a level of > 25 mmol/L. The median value for bicarbonate levels was 23 mmol/L, suggesting that most healthy people in the United States have low-grade metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 24–26 mmol/L). Having a low urinary pH, another marker of low-grade metabolic acidosis, is associated with a higher risk of visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome. A high dietary acid load also increases cortisol, which can cause visceral adiposity and increase blood glucose and blood pressure.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^e3fb5b89]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The UOG, in contrast to the urine anion gap, is not invalidated by increased excretion of unmeasured anions and therefore is the preferred measure to further analyze the causes for hyperchloremic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Type 1 (distal) RTA is based on defective distal tubular H+ secretion and is characterized by inadequately high urinary pH (> 5.3) during hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In type II (proximal) RTA the underlying cause is a defect in proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption. This results in urinary bicarbonate loss also resulting in inappropriately high urine pH during hyperchloremic acidosis. However, in established type II RTA, after severe bicarbonate depletion has occurred, minimum urinary pH is usually below pH 5.3. Type IV RTA is based on mineralocorticoid deficiency or inadequate renal response to mineralocorticoids. It is characterized by low urinary pH and - contrary to RTA types I/II - hyperkalemia.

The prevalence of RTA and underlying metabolic changes has been studied in patients after kidney transplantation and in osteoporotic patients. However, studies in critically ill patients are lacking.

Based on the physical-chemical approach, more than one metabolic acid-base disorder at the same time was found to be common in critical illness. Thus, 'metabolic acidosis' and 'metabolic alkalosis' may be present in the same patient at the same time, potentially leading to normal pH values. The terms 'acidosis' and 'alkalosis' are defined as separate effects that decrease or increase arterial pH, respectively, whereas 'acidemia' and 'alkalemia' are defined as net arterial pH < 7.35 or > 7.45, respectively.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients and to analyze the underlying acid-base state using a physical-chemical approach according to Gilfix et al.

### Association between early metabolic acidosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia / death in preterm infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation: an observational cohort study [^d43a26bd]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of this study do not allow any definitive conclusions to be drawn about the cause of the metabolic acidosis in this contemporary study cohort. However, due to the low gestational age and the low bicarbonate levels, renal involvement with bicarbonate loss can be assumed as a contributory cause of acidosis. Since parenteral nutrition with amino acids and lipids was routinely started on the day of birth, an influence of the nutritional components on the acid-base homeostasis is also conceivable. The administration of chloride, whether by bolus administration of normal saline or as an electrolyte supplement to parenteral nutrition, may have also contributed to metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloremia can in turn lead to renal vasoconstriction and a reduced glomerular filtration rate, thus potentially affect the fluid balance. In addition, higher lactate levels on postnatal day 3 in the BPD/death cohort may indicate that inadequate tissue oxygenation and lactic acidosis due to poor cardiac function could have contributed to metabolic acidosis in some patients through hypoxia-hypoperfusion mechanism. Whether specifically metabolic (lactate-)acidosis due to hypoxia/hypovolemia was associated with BPD/death could not be adequately answered, as there is no defined threshold for the lactate value to clearly differentiate acidosis caused by hypoxia from acidosis due to other causes in preterm infants. Several studies have reported an association between the fluid intake including parenteral nutrition in early life, which may also affect the acid-base balance, and the development of BPD.

It would be conceivable that metabolic acidosis was not causally related to the development of BPD, but was merely a marker for a higher risk of BPD influenced by other factors. Adequately powered translational studies are therefore required to evaluate the impact of metabolic acidosis on BPD and to investigate potential treatment thresholds for metabolic acidosis in extremely preterm neonates.

Limitations

This study has several limitations, such as its retrospective and monocentric nature. Differences in the duration and number of acidotic episodes were not analysed, nor were further pH, BE or SBC cut-off values to define metabolic acidosis, which could lead to bias. Respiratory parameters such as arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide or the type of respiratory treatment and data on nutrition including fluid status were not included in this study. Not every patient had a blood gas sample taken every single day, and sicker neonates may have had more tests performed, which may lead to bias. Metabolic acidosis due to hypoxia/hypoperfusion was not separately analysed. Based on it's nature and results, this study cannot ascertain a causal relationship between metabolic acidosis and a higher risk of BPD/death, but rather generates hypothesis.

### Metabolic acidosis [^afff4465]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^bfc7c3fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^9a0a28c2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential Harm from Bicarbonate Administration

Although it may seem intuitive to treat all metabolic acidoses with bicarbonate supplementation, there are several ways that sodium bicarbonate administration can potentially cause harm. Excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate has been associated with decreased availability of oxygen at the tissue level due to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Although rare, aggressive bicarbonate therapy may result in alkalemia, causing increased binding of calcium to albumin, leading to a drop in ionized calcium levels and subsequent depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. In addition, due to the hyperosmolar nature of the solution sodium load associated with these preparations, patients may experience fluid shifts, notably pulmonary and cerebral edema. It is also important to note that the use of sodium bicarbonate relies on the ability of the patient to have effective ventilation. The bicarbonate anion combines with hydrogen ions to ultimately form CO₂. If minute ventilation is restricted, preventing adequate exhalation of CO₂, excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate may inadvertently cause hypercarbia and paradoxically lower the pH. Peripheral vein thrombophlebitis is another potential cause of iatrogenic complications from rapid administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, particularly in situations with faulty peripheral intravenous catheters, although recent data suggest that lower concentrations may not cause localized injury.

Why metabolic acidosis matters

Metabolic acidosis can have various adverse effects, but the most critical consequence is its effect on the cardiovascular system. Recognition of this effect dates back to the 1960s when a study reported reduced cardiac contractility at pH < 7.1 when lactic acid was administered to dogs. Animal experiments were also performed on dogs given lactic acid and hydrochloric acid to produce lactic acidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis. The dogs were given epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dobutamine to counteract the shock status. The cardiac index decreased when epinephrine or norepinephrine was administered; however, dobutamine administration increased the cardiac index. This result suggested that acidosis decreased the catecholamine reactivity to norepinephrine or epinephrine. Pedoto et al. reported that when hydrochloric acid was administered to rats to mimic hyperchloremic acidosis, nitric oxide (NO) production increased, provoking vasodilation, and resulting in reduced systemic blood pressure. Fatal arrhythmias induced by acidosis have also been reported in an experimental model. However, clinical studies in humans have not yet demonstrated a causal relationship between metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular dysfunction.

### Chronic kidney disease increases the susceptibility to negative effects of low and high potassium intake [^4ca6868c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The development of hypertension secondary to extreme high K + diets in rodents has now been reported by several groups, and was also clear in our 5/6Nx rats on a less extreme but still unphysiologically high 2.5% K + diet. This suggests that increasing dietary K + intake may only decrease blood pressure when it is used to normalize a low K + diet. This is in agreement with a previous meta-analysis which demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between dietary K + intake and blood pressure. There are several possible reasons why a high K + diet increases blood pressure, including higher plasma aldosterone, hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis. Higher ENaC abundance is compatible with an aldosterone effect, although ENaC can also be activated directly by extracellular K +. Little et al. recently showed that hypertension on a high K + diet can be reversed by amiloride further supporting a role for ENaC. An interesting finding was that the attenuated hypertension on the high KCitrate diet occurred with higher pNCC and with similar plasma aldosterone and ENaC levels. The stimulatory effect of KCitrate on pNCC has been reported previously. We propose that hypochloremia explained higher pNCC assuming that intracellular chloride concentrations were also lower, which are a recognized stimulant for NCC. The greater rise in blood pressure with KCl suggests a role for dietary chloride and, indeed, we found a significant correlation between plasma chloride and blood pressure. Previous studies demonstrated an effect of dietary chloride on blood pressure. In uninephrectomized rats treated with desoxycorticosterone, a high sodium chloride but not sodium bicarbonate diet increased blood pressure. In 25 patients with essential hypertension, K + citrate supplementation decreased blood pressure to a greater extent than K + chloride. Chloride can induce renal vasoconstriction, which could potentially result in higher blood pressure. Another interesting observation is the high urinary sodium excretion in the high dietary K + groups. This has been shown previously and, although speculative, may imply that the animals are not in steady state or that part of the K + salts are excreted as sodium salts.

### Meta-analysis of high-versus low-chloride content in perioperative and critical care fluid resuscitation [^064f7e81]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Meta-analysis of all available studies demonstrated a significantly higher risk of AKI, metabolic acidosis, blood transfusion and time on mechanical ventilation with high-chloride fluid resuscitation. The association between high-chloride fluids, metabolic acidosis and higher serum chloride levels is supported by several studies, that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the present meta-analysis, and provides face validity for a conceptual mechanism of deleterious effects of hyperchloraemia. No increased risk for mortality was found.

High-chloride fluids were significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI/renal failure. This endpoint was driven heavily by one study, and sensitivity analysis excluding this study showed the same direction of effect, but loss of statistical significance. Each remaining study demonstrated a directionally similar association between increased AKI/renal failure and high-chloride fluids. One limitation in interpreting these data is the lack of uniformity among definitions of AKI. Ideally a standardized definition would be applied for the analysis; however, this was not possible with the available data. Moreover, serum creatinine concentration, a surrogate marker of renal function, did not demonstrate an association with the fluid chloride content. Failure to detect such an association may be related to reporting of serum creatinine levels at variable time points, and the possibility that the magnitude of differences in serum creatinine concentration may vary with time.

### Very low and high predialysis serum bicarbonate levels are risk factors for mortality: what are the appropriate interventions? [^cab84e06]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Adjustment of bath [HCO₃⁻] to "normalize" predialysis serum [HCO₃⁻] in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis has been advocated to prevent the adverse effects of metabolic acidosis. However, when mortality risk has been evaluated in hemodialysis patients in relation to their nadir serum [HCO₃⁻], an increase in risk is noted both with very low values (< 18 mmol/l) and very high values (> 27 mmol/l). If mortality risk is adjusted for comorbidity, age and effectiveness of dialysis, as well as for nutritional and inflammatory factors, very low predialysis values remain an independent risk factor, but the risk for high values virtually disappears. Patients with mild predialysis metabolic acidosis (serum [HCO₃⁻] 18–23 mmol/l) have the lowest mortality risk. Metabolic acidosis has adverse effects on bone and muscle metabolism in patients receiving hemodialysis but, unless the acidosis is severe, these effects appear to be overshadowed by nutritional and inflammatory influences. This commentary reviews the principles of acid-base homeostasis in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis and the studies that have addressed the adverse effects of metabolic acidosis in this patient population. It concludes that high predialysis serum [HCO(3)(-)] values are likely a marker for malnutrition and comorbidity, whereas very low values may be an indication for direct treatment. The latter should be addressed using strategies to increase predialysis values, whereas the former need attention directed to nutritional factors and comorbidity.

### Positive impact of sodium L-lactate supplementation on blood acid-base status in preterm newborns [^0b6500b5]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical studies indicate that lactate is a crucial cerebral energy substrate, with Na-L-lactate administration significantly reducing brain lesion volumes and improving motor and cognitive functions following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia in rat pups. Its neuroprotective effects are linked to neuronal metabolic utilization, making it a promising candidate for treating newborns with hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy, a condition where hypothermia remains the only established therapy. However, before initiating a clinical trial, it is necessary to assess the effects of Na-L-lactate infusion on blood parameters.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed blood parameters in 60 premature neonates during their first days of life. Among them, 30 received Na-L-lactate instead of Na-Cl to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis. Blood pH, lactatemia, bicarbonates, glycemia, natremia, chloremia, base excess, and hemoglobin were monitored before, during, and after Na-L-lactate infusion.

Results

Our findings showed that Na-L-lactate infusion lowered blood lactate levels while increasing pH from 7.25 to 7.31. After stopping the infusion, lactatemia was 1.9mM, and pH reached 7.32. Na-L-lactate supplementation effectively restored normal blood pH, maintained natremia, and prevented hyperchloremia. Notably, even in cases of high initial lactatemia, lactate levels decreased during the infusion.

Conclusion

Our data are promising and emphasize the need for further research to explore its potential applications in neonatal clinical care.

Impact

Sodium L-lactate infusion does not increase blood lactate levels and restores normal pH in premature neonates. The study demonstrates that sodium L-lactate infusion avoids hyperchloremia while maintaining sodium levels, offering a potential alternative to sodium chloride. These findings highlight the need for additional research studies to further evaluate the safety, efficacy, and potential applications of sodium L-lactate infusion in neonatal care.

Two studies, included in the present analysis involved paediatric patients. Although both studies were small (22 and 122 patients respectively) and therefore unlikely to impact significantly on the effect estimates, sensitivity analysis excluding these two trials was performed in order to account for potential differences in fluid physiology in paediatric versus adult patients. There was no impact on either effect direction or significance for any of the measured endpoints when these studies were excluded: mortality (RR 1.13, 95 per cent c.i. 0.92 to 1.39; P = 0.250), hospital LOS (SMD −0.07, −0.13 to −0.02; P = 0.013), hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 8.50, 2.49 to 29.0; P < 0.001) or serum chloride (MD 4.02 (3.66 to 4.37) mmol/l; P < 0.001).

### Phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia) [^7770f301]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Metabolic Acidosis

Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) has been reported in patients treated with QSYMIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (i.e., renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, surgery, or ketogenic diet) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of QSYMIA. Concomitant use of QSYMIA and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Avoid use of QSYMIA with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. If concomitant use of QSYMIA with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is unavoidable, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis.

Measure electrolytes including serum bicarbonate prior to starting QSYMIA and during QSYMIA treatment. In QSYMIA clinical trials, the peak reduction in serum bicarbonate typically occurred within 4 weeks of titration to the assigned dose, and in most patients, there was a correction of bicarbonate by week 56, without any dosage reduction. However, if persistent metabolic acidosis develops while taking QSYMIA, reduce the dosage or discontinue QSYMIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^3dd8816a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as Na⁺ − (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) = Unmeasured anions-Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8-12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO₃⁻: Δ gap = observed anion gap − normal anion gap and the Δ HCO₃⁻ = normal HCO₃⁻ − observed HCO₃⁻. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO₃⁻ and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO₃⁻. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^f129989c]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

However, in healthy volunteers, the fall in serum bicarbonate concentration after saline infusions is in the range of 1–2 mmol/l (refs.,) and this, on its own, does not explain development of acidosis on the basis of the Henderson-Hesselbach equation. Crystalloid infusions are also associated with a decrease in serum albumin concentration, even in healthy subjects. The negatively charged albumin molecule accounts for about 75% of the anion gapand acute dilutional hypoalbuminemia can effectively reduce the upper limit of the normal range for the anion gap. In critically ill patients, the anion gap has been shown to reduce by 2.5 mmol/l for every 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration. However, once again, development of acidosis cannot be explained entirely as albumin concentrations fall even after the infusion of balanced crystalloids or 5% dextrose.,

Hence, the mechanism of acidosis after infusions of 0.9% saline may be better explained by the Stewart hypothesis. This describes a mathematical approach to acid–base balance based on the apparent strong ion difference (SID a, [Na⁺]+[K⁺] − [Cl⁻]) being the major determinant of H⁺ ion concentration. A decrease in SID a is associated with metabolic acidosis and an increase with metabolic alkalosis. Hyperchloremia consequent on saline infusions decreases the SID a, and is the process that results in a metabolic acidosis. Canine experiments on resuscitation from septic shock have shown that 0.9% saline accounted for 42% of the acidosis observed, whereas lactate was responsible for only 10%.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

### Hyperchloremia is the dominant cause of metabolic acidosis in the postresuscitation phase of pediatric meningococcal sepsis [^85e381a0]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Metabolic acidosis is common in septic shock, yet few data exist on its etiological temporal profile during resuscitation; this is partly due to limitations in bedside monitoring tools (base excess, anion gap). Accurate identification of the type of acidosis is vital, as many therapies used in resuscitation can themselves produce metabolic acidosis.

Design

Retrospective, cohort study.

Setting

Multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit with 20 beds.

Patients

A total of 81 children with meningococcal septic shock.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Results

Acid-base data were collected retrospectively on 81 children with meningococcal septic shock (mortality, 7.4%) for the 48 hrs after presentation to the hospital. Base excess was partitioned using abridged Stewart equations, thereby quantifying the three predominant influences on acid-base balance: sodium chloride, albumin, and unmeasured anions (including lactate). Metabolic acidosis was common at presentation (mean base excess, -9.7 mmol/L) and persisted for 48 hrs. However, the pathophysiology changed dramatically from one of unmeasured anions at admission (mean unmeasured anion base excess, -9.2 mmol/L) to predominant hyperchloremia by 8–12 hrs (mean sodium-chloride base excess, -10.0 mmol/L). Development of hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with the amount of chloride received during intravenous fluid resuscitation (r = .44), with the base excess changing, on average, by -0.4 mmol/L for each millimole per kilogram of chloride administered. Hyperchloremic acidosis resolved faster in patients who 1) manifested larger (more negative) sodium chloride-partitioned base excess, 2) maintained a greater urine output, and 3) received furosemide; and slower in those with high blood concentrations of unmeasured anions (all, p < .05).

Conclusions

Hyperchloremic acidosis is common and substantial after resuscitation for meningococcal septic shock. Recognition of this entity may prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful prolonged resuscitation.

### The choice of dialysate bicarbonate: do different concentrations make a difference? [^3effe810]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; it is typically caused by the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Thus, correction of metabolic acidosis is fundamental for the adequate management of many systemic complications of chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors including the following: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of the interdialytic period, and residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of metabolic alkalosis after dialysis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Our review is focused on the potential effects of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes such as mortality. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about this issue. Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease. We await further studies to assess the extent to which acid-base status is a major determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing hemodialysis. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. Based on this, we should keep the predialysis serum bicarbonate level at least at 22 mmol/l. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed by the attending nephrologist to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

### Acid-base disorders in liver disease [^5751dcbd]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Alongside the kidneys and lungs, the liver has been recognised as an important regulator of acid-base homeostasis. While respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder in chronic liver disease, various complex metabolic acid-base disorders may occur with liver dysfunction. While the standard variables of acid-base equilibrium, such as pH and overall base excess, often fail to unmask the underlying cause of acid-base disorders, the physical-chemical acid-base model provides a more in-depth pathophysiological assessment for clinical judgement of acid-base disorders, in patients with liver diseases. Patients with stable chronic liver disease have several offsetting acidifying and alkalinising metabolic acid-base disorders. Hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis is counteracted by hyperchloraemic and dilutional acidosis, resulting in a normal overall base excess. When patients with liver cirrhosis become critically ill (e.g., because of sepsis or bleeding), this fragile equilibrium often tilts towards metabolic acidosis, which is attributed to lactic acidosis and acidosis due to a rise in unmeasured anions. Interestingly, even though patients with acute liver failure show significantly elevated lactate levels, often, no overt acid-base disorder can be found because of the offsetting hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis. In conclusion, patients with liver diseases may have multiple co-existing metabolic acid-base abnormalities. Thus, knowledge of the pathophysiological and diagnostic concepts of acid-base disturbances in patients with liver disease is critical for therapeutic decision making.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^601e5fd2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The major renal response to metabolic acidosis is increased NH₄⁺ excretion. Therefore, a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function (glomerular filtration rate > 25 ml/min) represents an inadequate renal response and is characteristic for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

Subtypes of RTA were determined as follows:

RTA type I (distal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH ≥ 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H⁺ secretion in the distal tubule.

RTA type II (proximal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

RTA type IV: hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and high plasma potassium (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H⁺ and K⁺ excretion in the distal tubule.

Transient RTA was defined as RTA on a single study day, while persistent RTA was defined as RTA on two or more days.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients during the first week after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, defined as hyperchloremic acidosis (BE Chloride) ≤ −5 mmol/L), a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg, and a preserved renal function. Secondary outcome measures were to evaluate the risk factors for RTA.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^c4dd2305]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a frequent entity in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to identify the underlying acid-base imbalances with a particular focus on RTA. As the occurrence of more than one acid-base disturbance at the same time is common in critically ill patients our analysis was based on calculating the base excess subsets according to the physical-chemical approach by Gilfix et al.

Forty-three percent of the patients presented at least on one day with hyperchloremic acidosis during the first week of ICU stay. This is more frequent compared to Gunnerson et al. who found hyperchloremic acidosis in only 26% of critically ill patients. However, they did not determine base excess subsets. Therefore, they could not detect hyperchloremic acidosis in the state of normal arterial pH values, which therefore was probably underrepresented.

### Meta-analysis of high-versus low-chloride content in perioperative and critical care fluid resuscitation [^e3121784]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the relationship between the chloride content of intravenous resuscitation fluids and patient outcomes in the perioperative or intensive care setting.

Methods

Systematic searches were performed of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, controlled clinical trials and observational studies were included if they compared outcomes in acutely ill or surgical patients receiving either high-chloride (ion concentration greater than 111mmol/l up to and including 154mmol/l) or lower-chloride (concentration 111mmol/l or less) crystalloids for resuscitation. Endpoints examined were mortality, measures of kidney function, serum chloride, hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis, blood transfusion volume, mechanical ventilation time, and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and confidence intervals were calculated using fixed-effect modelling.

Results

The search identified 21 studies involving 6253 patients. High-chloride fluids did not affect mortality but were associated with a significantly higher risk of acute kidney injury (RR 1.64, 95 per cent c.i. 1.27 to 2.13; P < 0.001) and hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 2.87, 1.95 to 4.21; P < 0.001). High-chloride fluids were also associated with greater serum chloride (MD 3.70 (95 per cent c.i. 3.36 to 4.04) mmol/l; P < 0.001), blood transfusion volume (SMD 0.35, 0.07 to 0.63; P = 0.014) and mechanical ventilation time (SMD 0.15, 0.08 to 0.23; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding heavily weighted studies resulted in non-statistically significant effects for acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation time.

Conclusion

A weak but significant association between higher chloride content fluids and unfavourable outcomes was found, but mortality was unaffected by chloride content.

### Spuriously low serum bicarbonate levels in patients with hyperlipidemia: a report of 4 cases [^fb8e7a3f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Four patients were recently seen at our institution presenting with severe hypobicarbonatemia and elevated anion gap on serum specimens processed by an autoanalyzer using enzymatic reactions. Arterial blood gas values in each case revealed no significant acid-base disturbance and a marked discordance between arterial blood gas calculated bicarbonate levels and those reported on the basic metabolic panel. All patients had profound hyperlipidemia (triglycerides > 3,500mg/L), and ultracentrifugation of one patient's serum corrected the discordance. Lipid interference with the photometric measurement of light absorbance after enzymatic reaction in the autoanalyzer is thought to be responsible for the low reported bicarbonate values. Use of an indirect ion-specific electrode method for total carbon dioxide analysis would avoid this pitfall. Caution is advised when enzymatic autoanalyzer-calculated laboratory values are used to diagnose acid-base disturbances in patients with severe hyperlipidemia. Physicians involved in the diagnosis of acid-base disorders in hospitalized patients should always be aware of the method used by their chemistry laboratories to determine total carbon dioxide values.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^1d4d0488]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na⁺, K⁺) and anions (Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO 3− is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H + secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

### Whither the bicarbonate era [^e8d32d00]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

For metabolic acidosis, beyond treating the underlying cause, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing good perfusion, sodium bicarbonate is often given at variable arbitrary thresholds of depressed blood pH. Recently, Zanella and colleagues employed extracorporeal removal of chloride by electrodialysis in healthy pigs made acidemic by either lactic acid infusion or hypoventilation (CO 2 retention). By physically drawing off chloride and establishing a local separation of charge, blood electroneutrality at the membrane is immediately reestablished by the hydrolysis of water to yield a hydroxyl ion that instantly combines with CO 2 to form bicarbonate. The authors show the feasibility of quantitatively increasing bicarbonate in this fashion for both forms of acidosis without the associated and unwanted hypernatremia and volume loading that can occur with intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration. The accompanying editorialists proclaim the postbicarbonate era with this study that illustrates a major tenet of the Stewart approach to acid–base chemistry and its superiority over other approaches to understanding acid–base physiology and pathophysiology. In Stewart's paradigm, H⁺, OH⁻, HCO₃⁻, and CO₃²⁻ are relegated to the status of dependent variables; that is, they can only be formed from the differential movements and exchanges of independent strong ions (Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻) that disturb electroneutrality, which is immediately corrected by the hydrolysis of water and reaction with CO₂. Although the heuristics of the Stewart analysis are valid, I remain unconvinced by the claim that what the mathematics of this approach reveal demands that physiology must follow these rules and conclusions. The assumption that only strong ions and their differential movement from one space to another alters H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ concentrations because the math is consistent with it goes against all we know about numerous cell-membrane transporters that use H⁺, HCO₃⁻, or CO₃²⁻ as coions or counterions with Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻. There has been no identification of a Na⁺/Cl⁻ antiporter or an electrogenic Na⁺-Cl cotransporter that will alter local electroneutrality to create or consume the supposed dependent variables. Simply because one can electrodialyze chloride by brute force, as Zanella and colleagues report, does not mean it happens in vivo at the microscopic level. Clinical adoption of the Stewart approach has shown no superiority to conventional approaches, and the measurement of all the strong ions repeatedly is wasteful and costly, risks measurement errors that beget more testing, contributes to anemia in many patients, contributes to more transfusions, and is very difficult to teach to trainees and even seasoned clinicians.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^3f533989]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na⁺) and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ions. Sodium (Na⁺) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H⁺) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO₂) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Association between intravenous chloride load during resuscitation and in-hospital mortality among patients with SIRS [^ea14ca55]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is noteworthy that mortality was elevated in the small group of patients (< 2.5% of the study population) who received relatively low volume-adjusted chloride loads (< 105 mmol/L). Potential explanations include the receipt of relatively large proportions of dextrose-containing maintenance fluids, which contain lower chloride concentrations, rather than active resuscitation. Particularly high-acuity patients may have died before receiving adequate resuscitation or fluid administration may have been limited because of concerns related to comorbidities such as congestive heart failure in which higher sodium loads are not tolerated and carry a high mortality rate.

Recent evidence indicates risks associated with high sodium loads and suggests that hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis and hypernatraemia may be independent complications associated with fluid infusion. While our study found a potential association between sodium load and mortality, the ability to fully separate sodium load from volume and tonicity is limited, and this question may warrant further study. Studies examining outcomes in light of relative differences in chloride and sodium load may provide important insights.

While the reasons for the association between increased mortality and elevated chloride levels remain to be fully elucidated, important clinical consequences of hyperchloraemia are known. High serum chloride concentrations following infusion of 0.9% saline are associated with reduced renal artery flow velocity, renal cortical tissue perfusion and longer time to urination. Additionally, animal studies have implicated hyperchloraemia in effects on the immune system, altered blood oxygen binding and organ damage.

In summary, this study demonstrates an association between IV chloride load and mortality in hospitalized patients with SIRS, independent of total fluid volume. Given the study's predefined fluid inclusion criteria, our findings may not be generalizable to all SIRS patients. Still, these findings support existing published data suggesting that fluid composition and volume both have important effects on clinical outcomes. Because the study was observational, the associations are hypothesis-generating and highlight the need for randomized controlled trials powered to detect outcome differences in patients resuscitated using different crystalloids. A multicentre study comparing 0.9% saline and a balanced crystalloid is underway. When viewed together with the existing literature, our findings may not represent evidence that high-chloride solutions are harmful "beyond a reasonable doubt" (they are observational), but the balance of probabilities appears to be shifting away from high-chloride and toward low-chloride solutions for first-line fluid resuscitation of patients with SIRS.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^77be3de5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a widespread acid-base disturbance, especially in hospitalized patients. It is characterized by the primary elevation of serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, along with a compensatory increase in P 2 consequent to adaptive hypoventilation. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis involves either a loss of fixed acid or a net accumulation of bicarbonate within the extracellular fluid. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney, whereas the sources of excess alkali may be via oral or parenteral alkali intake. Severe metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients — arterial blood pH of 7.55 or higher — is associated with significantly increased mortality rate. The kidney is equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to avert the generation or the persistence (maintenance) of metabolic alkalosis by enhancing bicarbonate excretion. These mechanisms include increased filtration as well as decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bicarbonate by specialized transporters in specific nephron segments. Factors that interfere with these mechanisms will impair the ability of the kidney to eliminate excess bicarbonate, therefore promoting the generation or impairing the correction of metabolic alkalosis. These factors include volume contraction, low glomerular filtration rate, potassium deficiency, hypochloremia, aldosterone excess, and elevated arterial carbon dioxide. Major clinical states are associated with metabolic alkalosis, including vomiting, aldosterone or cortisol excess, licorice ingestion, chloruretic diuretics, excess calcium alkali ingestion, and genetic diseases such as Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this installment in the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis; appraise the precipitating events; and discuss clinical presentations, diagnoses, and treatments of metabolic alkalosis.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^32549c77]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO₃⁻], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Chasing the base deficit: hyperchloraemic acidosis following 0.9% saline fluid resuscitation [^5aaee7ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2000). Low credibility.

Base deficit is a parameter often used to guide further treatment in acidotic children and is taken as a measure of how "sick" they are. Five children with septic shock are presented who had persisting base deficit after large volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline. Stewart's strong ion theory of acid-base balance is able to quantify the causes of metabolic acidosis and is used to show that our patients had a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. We show how the chloride content of the saline loads given to our patients caused this hyperchloraemia. It is concluded that 0.9% saline and other chloride rich fluids may not be ideal resuscitation fluids; if used, clinicians must be aware of their potential to cause a persistent base deficit.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^4d2aa417]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological considerations of the reported case

In our patient, several precipitating factors were present: the major surgery, postoperative fasting and presumably impaired insulin secretion, suggested by the recent addition of insulin to the medication. In addition, the nurses described the patient as very anxious, which may have contributed to increased ketogenesis. In the study of Kubera, even simple psychosocial stress increased the beta-hydroxybutyrate level fourfold.

Rather low level of ketones corresponded to mild DKA. Hyperchloremic acidosis could alternatively be explained by renal tubular acidosis with direct loss of bicarbonate. However, we have found only 3 published cases of severe proximal tubule disorder, Fanconi syndrome, during SGLT2i treatment that presented with renal tubular acidosis with rather low anion gap, but all with elevated ketone levels. Due to the anuria of our patient, we could not perform a urine test to refine the diagnosis.

Let us try to assess whether the renal loss of ketones at such a low beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration (3.2 mmol/l) could really have led to such a profound hyperchloremic acidosis within 4 days of surgery. Assume that complete renal resorption of ketones occurs up to the plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 2 mmol/l. Correspondingly, the maximum resorption is 300 mmol/day with a normal glomerular filtration rate of 150 l/day. Thus, at a concentration of 3.2 mmol/l, up to approximately 150 mmol of beta-hydroxybutyrate or up to 200 mmol of ketoacids including acetoacetate could be lost per day. If ketones were excreted only as sodium or potassium salts due to impaired ammoniogenesis, up to 200 mmol/day or 800 mmol in 4 days of bicarbonate could be lost indirectly. As shown in Table 1, after correction for increased lactate, the deficit of bicarbonate was approximately 15 mmol/l, corresponding to 200 mmol in 15 l of extracellular fluid, which is far from the theoretically possible 800 mmol, even when intracellular titration is taken into account. Thus, the renal loss of ketones is sufficient to explain the severity of the hyperchloremic acidosis. Note that the patient had already been admitted to the ICU with severe hyperchloremic acidosis without prior treatment with normal saline.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^9cfa788d]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### Dialysate bicarbonate concentration: too much of a good thing? [^45e36e6b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD. It is typically due to the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization and mortality. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of interdialytic period, as well as residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of postdialysis metabolic alkalosis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about the effect of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes, such as mortality. Like everything else in dialysis, the quest for the "ideal" dialysate bicarbonate concentration is far from over. The Latin aphorism "ne quid nimis" ie "nothing in excess" (excess of neither acid nor base) probably best summarizes our current state of knowledge in this field. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. On the basis of this information, we should keep predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations at least at 22 mEq/L. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

### Hyperchloremia and moderate increase in serum chloride are associated with acute kidney injury in severe sepsis and septic shock patients [^0f7bfcae]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

We did not find a statistically significant association between hyperchloremia and need for RRT although we observed a trend in this direction. A previous study found a similar statistically significant trend in the association of chloride restrictive strategy and reduction of RRT requirement. However, we excluded the patients with pre-existing chronic renal failure and need of RRT in our study was lower (5% vs 10%). Second, a smaller sample size in our study limited the statistical power of detection. Moreover, our populations were exclusively severe sepsis or septic shock while in the previous study only 7% were severe sepsis or septic shock.

Normal saline solution was originally called "indifferent" saline because it was recognized that human erythrocytes did not lyse in the 0.9% NaCl solution. Despite being called "normal saline" solution, it has a near physiological concentration of sodium (154 mmol/L) but supraphysiologic concentration of chloride (154 mmol/L or 1.5 times of normal serum chloride concentration). Infusion of 0.9% NaCl is significantly associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in both healthy volunteers and various types of patient. The clinical significance of iatrogenic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis remains uncertain. The hospital mortality is much higher in lactic acidosis than in hyperchloremic acidosis (56% vs 29%) compared with the hospital mortality of patients without acidosis (26%).

Supraphysiologic serum chloride concentration has detrimental effects on renal function. In animal models, infusion of 0.9% NaCl resulted in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate possibly due to chloride-induced thromboxane release and augmented response to renal vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II. Furthermore, the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism initiated by detection of chloride at the macula densa results in afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, mesangial contraction and decreased glomerular filtration rate. In healthy human volunteers, infusion of normal saline caused reductions in renal artery blood flow, renal cortical perfusion and delayed first micturition. Saline infusion resulted in a higher incidence of AKI when compared with balanced crystalloids. In an animal model of sepsis, resuscitation of septic animals with Saline resulted in not only higher incidence of AKI and greater severity of AKI but also higher inflammatory mediator concentrations (IL-6) when compared to Plasma-Lyte. Interestingly, the study of effect of an acute Saline infusion on fluid and electrolyte metabolism revealed that the human body required 2 days to restore electrolyte and fluid balance to equilibrium.

### Lactic acidosis: current treatments and future directions [^afba4b67]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mortality rates associated with severe lactic acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) due to sepsis or low-flow states are high. Eliminating the triggering conditions remains the most effective therapy. Although recommended by some, administration of sodium bicarbonate does not improve cardiovascular function or reduce mortality. This failure has been attributed to both reduction in serum calcium concentration and generation of excess carbon dioxide with intracellular acidification. In animal studies, hyperventilation and infusion of calcium during sodium bicarbonate administration improves cardiovascular function, suggesting that this approach could allow expression of the positive aspects of sodium bicarbonate. Other buffers, such as THAM or Carbicarb, or dialysis might also provide base with fewer untoward effects. Examination of these therapies in humans is warranted. The cellular injury associated with lactic acidosis is partly due to activation of NHE1, a cell-membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. In animal studies, selective NHE1 inhibitors improve cardiovascular function, ameliorate lactic acidosis, and reduce mortality, supporting future research into their possible use in humans. Two main mechanisms contribute to lactic acid accumulation in sepsis and low-flow states: tissue hypoxia and epinephrine-induced stimulation of aerobic glycolysis. Targeting these mechanisms could allow for more specific therapy. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case presents a patient with acute lactic acidosis and describes current and future approaches to treatment.

### Severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis induced by topiramate: a case report [^a8fabb56]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A non-anion gap acidosis can be induced by topiramate, causing symptomatic dyspnea and confusion.

Objectives

Discuss the pathophysiology of the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis caused by topiramate, the typical clinical presentation, and the recommended treatment.

Case Report

This case presents a young woman with a clinically significant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis believed to be caused by topiramate. She had been taking the medication for several months without prior adverse effects. Once she began having dyspnea as a respiratory response to the renal tubule acidosis, she had decreased oral intake of food and fluids, which induced a pre-renal acute renal failure that worsened her acidemia. In the Emergency Department, she received intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and later was intubated for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. With the topiramate withdrawn, the patient had a full recovery of her renal function and metabolic acid-base status over the next 72 h. This case serves to increase awareness of this possible adverse effect and the recommended treatment as topiramate becomes more widely used.

Conclusions

Topiramate can induce a renal tubule acidosis resulting in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recognition of the underlying cause is crucial so that the drug can be withdrawn while supportive care is provided.

### Association between sodium-chloride difference at ICU admission and 30-day mortality: a retrospective cohort study of critically ill adults [^7b94a2e1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, recent analyses suggest that isolated evaluation of individual electrolyte disturbances may have limited prognostic value compared to integrated assessments like SCD. Notably, hyperchloremia at ICU admission continues to emerge as a robust predictor of mortality, highlighting the need to reconsider how electrolyte data is interpreted in critical care. Drawing unambiguous conclusions about the prognostic utility of SCD or chloride levels alone in mortality prediction remains challenging based on current literature. Our results, at least partially, contribute to addressing this knowledge gap.

Although some clinicians recognize that dysnatremia and dyschloremia do not occur in isolation, clinical practice often assumes that changes in sodium concentration will be accompanied by corresponding changes in serum chloride levels (or vice versa). In our analyses, both sodium and chloride individually demonstrated significant non-linear associations with 30-day mortality. However, evaluating these electrolytes in isolation is limited by their collinearity and by the bidirectional risk observed at both low and high values. In contrast, the SCD provides an integrated and clinically simple measure that yielded a clearer and more consistent association with outcome in our cohort. It is important to emphasize that our study was not designed to test complex physicochemical models of acid–base balance but rather to evaluate SCD as a clinically useful prognostic marker that may outperform sodium or chloride alone in risk assessment.

In our exploratory post-hoc analysis, low SCD was associated with a higher risk of AKI. This observation aligns with prior evidence suggesting that chloride-rich saline solutions may contribute to renal dysfunction, whereas balanced crystalloids are associated with lower rates of AKI and adverse kidney outcomes. For instance, the SMART randomized trial demonstrated that balanced crystalloids reduced the incidence of major adverse kidney events compared with saline, and similar findings were reported for urinary biomarkers of kidney injury. Although the BaSICS and SPLIT trials did not demonstrate significant differences in mortality or AKI incidence, the overall trend across trials and meta-analyses supports the hypothesis that prevention of AKI mediates part of the survival benefit observed with balanced fluids. In line with this interpretation, our results suggest that some of the association between low SCD and higher mortality may indeed be mediated through the development of AKI.

Bicarbonate Absorption and Secretion in the Distal Nephron (Including the Collecting Duct)

The collecting duct plays a major role in systemic acid-base homeostasis by fine-tuning the excretion of acid and base. The cortical collecting duct comprises 3 cell types: A-intercalated cells, which secrete H⁺ (acid); B-intercalated cells, which secrete HCO₃⁻ (base); and principal cells, which absorb Na⁺ and water and secrete potassium ion (K⁺). H⁺ secretion by A-intercalated cells is primarily by apical H⁺-ATPases (and H⁺/K⁺-ATPases), generating new HCO₃⁻ under the control of cytosolic CAII. This HCO₃⁻ is delivered to the blood in exchange for Cl⁻ by the basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ anion exchange protein 1 (AE1).

As opposed to A-intercalated cells, which occur along the length of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts, B-intercalated cells are primarily localized to the cortical collecting duct and are rarely found in the medullary collecting duct. Thanks mostly to the apical Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger pendrin, B-intercalated cells secrete HCO₃⁻ into the cortical collecting duct lumen in exchange for luminal Cl⁻. The intracellular acid that results from HCO₃⁻ secretion in B-intercalated cells is transported into the blood by the basolateral H⁺-ATPase. The 3 major cell types in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) along with their apical and basolateral transporters involved in H⁺, HCO₃⁻, or electrolyte transport are shown in Figure 1.

Endocrine and Fluids Management Statements

Volume management takes into consideration the cause of arrest, hemodynamic target chosen, and underlying organ dysfunction and is individualized to each patient (100%, 23/23).
Balance the risk for cerebral edema with complications associated with hyperchloremia when choosing intravenous fluid after CA. The preferred choice in the setting of cerebral edema is normal saline, although balanced crystalloid solutions may minimize hyperchloremia and the potential for AKI when cerebral edema is not present (95.7%, 22/23).
Do not use sodium bicarbonate routinely in patients after CA who have metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2, bicarbonate < 20) and AKI stage 2 or 3 (82.6%, 19/23).
Consider RRT after CA for when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance exist and for conditions that can potentially be modified with RRT (100%, 23/23).
Do not administer empirical corticosteroids to all patients after CA, although supplemental corticosteroids may be useful to treat persistent shock in patients with proven or suspected adrenal suppression (91.3%, 21/23).
Consider treatment of hyperglycemia with glucose targets of 81 to 180 mg/dL (100%, 19/19).

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^431eb776]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na⁺) and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ions. Sodium (Na⁺) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H⁺) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO₂) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1 :20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Relationship of at admission lactate, unmeasured anions, and chloride to the outcome of critically ill patients [^4f31b984]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the association between the concentration of the causative anions responsible for the main types of metabolic acidosis and the outcome.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Teaching ICU.

Patients

All patients admitted from January 2006 to December 2014.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Four thousand nine hundred one patients were admitted throughout the study period; 1,609 met criteria for metabolic acidosis and 145 had normal acid-base values. The association between at admission lactate, unmeasured anions, and chloride concentration with outcome was assessed by multivariate analysis in the whole cohort and in patients with metabolic acidosis. We also compared the mortality of patients with lactic, unmeasured anions, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with that of patients without acid-base disorders. In the whole population, increased lactate and unmeasured anions were independently associated with increased mortality, even after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.14 (1.08–1.20); p < 0.0001 and 1.04 (1.02–1.06); p < 0.0001, respectively). In patients with metabolic acidosis, the results were similar. Patients with lactic and unmeasured anions acidosis, but not those with hyperchloremic acidosis, had an increased mortality compared to patients without alterations (17.7%, 12.7%, 4.9%, and 5.8%, respectively; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

In this large cohort of critically ill patients, increased concentrations of lactate and unmeasured anions, but not chloride, were associated with increased mortality. In addition, increased unmeasured anions were the leading cause of metabolic acidosis.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^cc19fcd1]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Three studies have described the effect of HTS on acid–base balance. Two retrospective cohort studies described the use of a sodium acetate and NaCl mix (to equal a 2 to 3% solution) which demonstrated no difference in the rate of metabolic acidosis. Tseng et al. reported on the use of 23.5% NaCl to achieve a goal serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L in patients with SAH. No significant changes in serum bicarbonate concentration were noted. Despite the relative lack of studies demonstrating substantial acid–base imbalances with HTS use, clinicians should be mindful of the potential for hyperchloremia to induce metabolic acidosis, which may stimulate respiratory drive.

Though the quality of the evidence is low, it suggests that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia from HTS are associated with AKI. In addition, the impact of HTS on acid–base balance is not well defined in studies including neurocritical care patients. Clinicians should monitor renal function, electrolytes, and acid–base balance closely when using HTS.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^7897de45]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is a rare, relatively new and potentially fatal clinical entity, characterized by metabolic acidosis with normal or only moderately elevated glycemia. The mechanisms are not fully understood but involve increased ketogenesis and complex renal metabolic dysfunction, resulting in both ketoacidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis. We report a rare case of fatal empagliflozin-associated acidosis with profound hyperchloremia and review its pathogenesis.

Case Presentation

A patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with empagliflozin underwent an elective hip replacement surgery. Since day 4 after surgery, he felt generally unwell, leading to cardiac arrest on the day 5. Empagliflozin-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with severe hyperchloremic acidosis was identified as the cause of the cardiac arrest.

Conclusions

This unique case documents the possibility of severe SGLT2 inhibitor-associated mixed metabolic acidosis with a predominant hyperchloremic component. Awareness of this possibility and a high index of suspicion are crucial for correct and early diagnosis.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^62f5f180]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.
