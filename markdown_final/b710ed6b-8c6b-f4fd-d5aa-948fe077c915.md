## Question

A 45-year-old woman is in a high-speed motor vehicle accident and suffers multiple injuries to her extremities and abdomen. In the field, she was bleeding profusely bleeding and, upon arrival to the emergency department, she is lethargic and unable to speak. Her blood pressure on presentation is 70/40 mmHg. The trauma surgery team recommends emergency exploratory laparotomy. While the patient is in the trauma bay, her husband calls and says that the patient is a Jehovah's witness and that her religion does not permit her to receive a blood transfusion. No advanced directives are available. Which of the following is an appropriate next step?
A. Provide transfusions as needed
B. Withhold transfusion based on husband's request
C. Obtain an ethics consult
D. Obtain a court order for transfusion

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate for a 45-year-old Jehovah's Witness trauma patient who is lethargic, hypotensive, and facing emergent laparotomy, when her husband reports her religious objection to transfusion but there is no advance directive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's decisional capacity and whether emergency consent principles apply. Then, I should verify the legal status of surrogate decision-making in this context. Next, I will weigh beneficence versus autonomy and consider bloodless strategies. After that, I need to check the role and timing of ethics consultation versus court intervention. Finally, I will synthesize the most defensible next step and outline immediate actions while the decision process proceeds in parallel with life-saving care [^b4cf5240] [^f6e0be1f].

> Let me first confirm capacity and the emergency doctrine. The patient is lethargic and unable to speak, so she lacks capacity to make contemporaneous decisions; in this setting, clinicians may act under presumed consent for life-threatening emergencies when delay would cause harm, but that presumption is rebutted if there is reliable evidence the patient would refuse the intervention, such as a valid advance directive or a clearly documented prior refusal, which we do not have here [^1944e13a] [^764419b4].

> Wait, let me verify the surrogate status. The husband is a surrogate, but in most jurisdictions a spouse does not have automatic authority to refuse life-sustaining treatment on behalf of an incapacitated adult without a durable power of attorney or explicit documentation; thus, his statement alone does not legally bind the team to withhold transfusion in an emergent, life-threatening scenario, even though it raises a red flag that must be resolved expeditiously [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about transfusion yet. I need to balance beneficence and autonomy. Beneficence supports transfusion now because she is in hemorrhagic shock and will likely die without it, whereas autonomy suggests honoring her beliefs if genuinely held and adequately documented; without clear, prior refusal, the balance in an emergency favors life-saving care under presumed consent, but I should confirm this with ethics and document the rationale transparently [^1944e13a] [^f6e0be1f].

> I should double-check the practical next step. Obtaining an immediate ethics consultation is the most appropriate action because it rapidly addresses the conflict, documents the surrogate's report, reviews any available evidence of the patient's wishes, and advises on legal and policy-compliant pathways, including whether to transfuse under emergency doctrine or to seek a court order if refusal is substantiated; this aligns with trauma and surgical guidance to involve ethics early when blood refusal is asserted without clear documentation [^8b057185] [^b4cf5240].

> But wait, what if the team transfuse and later learn she had a valid refusal? I need to ensure we mitigate that risk by simultaneously pursuing bloodless strategies and verifying preferences as fast as possible. Many Jehovah's Witnesses accept alternatives such as cell salvage, acute normovolemic hemodilution, tranexamic acid, fibrinogen concentrate, and factor concentrates; employing these measures now demonstrates respect for her values while we clarify her legal status and reduces transfusion needs even if transfusion becomes necessary to save life [^0fb6eb4d] [^b7525a61] [^b4cf5240].

> Let me consider the court-order option. Seeking a court order is premature here because there is no documented refusal and no time to obtain one before irreversible harm; court intervention is typically reserved for persistent conflicts after ethics review, for minors, or when there is credible evidence of prior refusal that the team feels ethically compelled to honor despite the emergency, none of which is established in this case yet [^89a05b40] [^b4cf5240].

> I should confirm the immediate clinical actions while ethics is engaged. Activate massive transfusion and damage-control resuscitation, use TXA early, employ cell salvage and antifibrinolytics as acceptable, and document that the team is honoring the patient's asserted beliefs to the greatest extent feasible while proceeding with life-saving care under presumed consent pending clarification; this approach is consistent with contemporary trauma and patient blood management guidance for patients declining transfusion in emergencies [^b7525a61] [^b4cf5240] [^c305aeb5].

> In summary, I need to ensure the decision is ethically and legally defensible. The most appropriate next step is to obtain an immediate ethics consultation while initiating life-saving care and blood-sparing measures, because the patient lacks capacity, there is no advance directive, and the husband's assertion alone does not constitute a legally binding refusal in this emergency context; this balances beneficence and autonomy and provides a documented, reversible pathway if new information emerges [^8b057185] [^b4cf5240] [^1944e13a].

---

The correct next step is to **obtain an ethics consult** [^8b057185] because the patient lacks capacity, there is no advance directive, and the husband's statement is not a legally binding refusal. Ethics can urgently clarify the patient's prior wishes, assess surrogate authority, and guide whether to transfuse under emergency doctrine or seek a court order if needed [^1944e13a]. While awaiting ethics, initiate blood-sparing measures and prepare for emergency transfusion if life-threatening hemorrhage persists, as delay risks death [^b7525a61] [^b4cf5240].

---

## Ethical and legal considerations

- **Autonomy**: Competent adults have the right to refuse blood, but this patient lacks capacity; autonomy is not currently exercisable [^f6e0be1f].

- **Beneficence**: Life-saving transfusion is indicated for hemorrhagic shock; withholding risks death [^b7525a61].

- **Non-maleficence**: Both transfusion and non-transfusion can cause harm; balancing harms is essential [^defdad04].

- **Justice**: Fair treatment requires balancing individual beliefs with societal interests in preserving life [^1ea84aeb].

---

## Legal framework

- **Advance directives**: None present; no documented refusal exists [^764419b4].

- **Surrogate decision-making**: Spouses are not automatic surrogates for refusing life-sustaining treatment; authority must be documented or legally established [^notfound].

- **Emergency doctrine**: Presumed consent allows life-saving treatment when delay would cause harm, unless there is clear evidence of refusal [^1944e13a].

- **Court orders**: Used when refusal is unclear or conflicts with life-saving care; not first-line in this scenario [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Ethics consultation is recommended in trauma when Jehovah's Witness status is asserted without clear documentation, to clarify wishes and legal authority [^8b057185]. Blood-sparing strategies (cell salvage, antifibrinolytics, acute normovolemic hemodilution) should be initiated while decisions are pending [^b7525a61]. Emergency transfusion may proceed under presumed consent if hemorrhage is life-threatening and no clear refusal exists, with documentation of rationale [^1944e13a].

---

## Potential consequences of each option

| **Option** | **Potential consequences** |
|-|-|
| Provide transfusions as needed | - Life-saving <br/> - But may violate beliefs if patient truly refused <br/> - Legal risk if refusal is later proven [^notfound] |
| Withhold transfusion based on husband's request | - Risks patient death <br/> - Husband lacks legal authority to refuse <br/> - Ethical and legal liability for the team [^notfound] |
| Obtain ethics consult | - Balanced <br/> - Legally sound <br/> - Respects process <br/> - May delay care minimally [^notfound] |
| Obtain court order for transfusion | - Legally authoritative <br/> - But too slow for emergent hemorrhage <br/> - Not first-line here [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended course of action

Obtain an **immediate ethics consult** to clarify the patient's wishes, surrogate authority, and legal obligations, while initiating blood-sparing measures and preparing for transfusion if hemorrhage remains life-threatening. This approach balances autonomy, beneficence, and legal compliance, and is supported by ethics and trauma guidance [^8b057185] [^b4cf5240].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **obtain an ethics consult** [^8b057185] because the patient lacks capacity, there is no advance directive, and the husband's statement is not a legally binding refusal. Ethics can rapidly adjudicate surrogate authority and whether to transfuse under emergency doctrine or seek a court order if needed, while the team implements blood-sparing strategies and stands ready to transfuse if hemorrhage is life-threatening [^b7525a61].

Jehovah's Witnesses are primarily known to physicians for their refusal of blood transfusions. Conflict arises at times with the medical staff concerning how best to manage their care. This article will begin with a brief description of the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and will then recommend specific clinical strategies highlighting newer potential therapies according to the principles of bloodless medicine. The scenarios of bleeding and acute and chronic anemia will be discussed in detail for the care of these patients refusing red blood cell transfusions. An update in the use of blood substitutes will be mentioned as well as the surgical advances used today that can minimize blood loss for all patients. The experience of organ transplantation in Jehovah's Witnesses will be detailed. Further resources for physicians with questions in the care of these patients will be listed. Stressed throughout the article will be the need for a team approach and good communication between physicians to successfully care for their patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses.

There are many patient groups who may refuse blood products; the most well known amongst them is the Jehovah's Witness faith. Treatment of anaemia and bleeding in such patients presents a challenge to medical, anaesthetic, and surgical teams. This review examines the perioperative issues and management of Jehovah's Witnesses. The history and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses are outlined together with their impact on ethics and the law, and different management options throughout the perioperative period are discussed.

Application to Other Patient Populations

The strategies described above can also be applied to other patients who may refuse blood products for nonreligious reasons, such as fear of contracting blood borne illness or transfusion reactions. It is critical to make sure the patient is informed of the true risks and benefits in these situations, although the right to refusal remains. These strategies are beneficial during times of blood shortages as well.

### The jehovah's witness and dementia: who or what defines' best interests'? [^d0ae9a89]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

An elderly woman with dementia presented for repeat surgical management of fractured neck of femur. Although no advance directive had ever been generated, the patient was declared to be a strict Jehovah's Witness by her daughter, who vetoed the transfusion of any blood products. The fracture was managed conservatively but the patient suffered repeated chest infections, from which she died 4 months after admission. This case raised several clinical, ethical and legal issues and generated a spectrum of opinion as to the appropriateness of operative intervention, transfusion and provision of intensive care. We suggest that professional guidelines and the new Mental Capacity Act 2005 do not provide explicit and comprehensive guidance for practitioners. Further deliberation is required to bring about convergence between the law, ethical principles and professional guidelines.

### Management of adult jehovah's witness patients with acute bleeding [^478f2297]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Because of the firm refusal of transfusion of blood and blood components by Jehovah's Witnesses, the management of Jehovah's Witness patients with severe bleeding is often complicated by medical, ethical, and legal concerns. Because of a rapidly growing and worldwide membership, physicians working in hospitals should be prepared to manage these patients. Appropriate management of a Jehovah's Witness patient with severe bleeding entails understanding of the legal and ethical issues involved, and meticulous medical management, including treatment of hypovolemic shock, local hemostatic interventions, and administration of prohemostatic agents, when appropriate. In addition, high-dose recombinant erythropoietin in combination with supplemental iron may enhance the speed of hemoglobin synthesis.

### Treatment of individuals who cannot receive blood products for religious or other reasons [^f901bc31]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

By virtue of their religious principles, Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs) generally object to receiving blood products, raising numerous ethical, legal, and medical challenges for providers who care for these patients, especially in the emergent setting. In this review, we discuss several areas relevant to the care of JWs, including the current literature on "bloodless" medical care in the setting of perioperative and intraoperative management, acute blood loss, trauma, pregnancy, and malignancy. We have found that medical and administrative efforts in the form of bloodless medicine and surgery programs can be instrumental in helping to reduce risks of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Planning prior to an anticipated event associated with blood loss or anemia (such as elective surgery, pregnancy, and chemotherapy) is critical. Specifically, bloodless medicine programs should prioritize vigilant early screening and management of anemias, early establishment of patient wishes regarding transfusion, and the incorporation of those wishes into multidisciplinary medical and surgical care. Although there are now a variety of human-based and nonhuman-based products available as transfusion alternatives, the degree and quality of evidence to support their use varies significantly between products and is also largely dependent on the clinical setting.

### Caring for the jehovah's witness parturient [^81ba0d3e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Caring for the Jehovah's Witness parturient is a complex task that presents a number of ethical, medical, and legal concerns because many Jehovah's Witnesses refuse allogeneic blood transfusion. Childbirth and its surrounding events may be associated with significant blood loss. Given their significant role in the intraoperative administration of blood products, anesthesia providers should be familiar with factors that must be considered in the perioperative care of Jehovah's Witness parturients. Several pharmacologic therapies, anesthetic techniques, and operative interventions aimed at blood conservation may be useful in the care of such patients. Aside from their refusal of transfusion, each Witness makes a personal decision on the acceptability of derivatives of plasma or cellular blood components and autologous blood management. Therefore, the patient-physician relationship must ensure that the individual patient's desires are accurately communicated, respected, and documented in the patient's medical record. The Perioperative Surgical Home model is appropriate for use in caring for Jehovah's Witness patients because it allows for the early and continuing coordination of care and communication between the patient and a multidisciplinary team. In this article, we present a focused review of concepts important to the provision of anesthetic care of parturients who are Jehovah's Witnesses and introduce an algorithmic perioperative approach that may be applied to the care of the Jehovah's Witness parturient undergoing an operative procedure.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^8082fc66]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Management of trauma patients who refuse blood products places additional restrictions on management options to care for patients in potentially life-threatening situations. Knowledge of alternative treatments, specific patient preferences, and multidisciplinary team management are vital in these cases.

Patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses frequently cross the path of nephrologists when they are acutely ill in the intensive care unit and stable in the long-term setting. It is important that we as a group have a rudimentary understanding of their philosophy about blood transfusion so that we can be proactive in their management. We use a case as a launching point to discuss the origins of the faith and the decision to refuse blood, as well as potential therapeutic strategies that can be used to improve the care of these patients. Improvement in our understanding as physicians will facilitate a more productive conversation with our patients about a complex and emotional issue.

### Association of anaesthetists: anaesthesia and peri-operative care for jehovah's witnesses and patients who refuse blood [^f6e0be1f]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 8.5 million Jehovah's Witnesses and around 150,000 live in Great Britain and Ireland. Based on their beliefs and core values, Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood component transfusion (including red cells, plasma and platelets). They regard non-consensual transfusion as a physical violation. Consent to treatment is at the heart of this guideline. Refusal of treatment by an adult with capacity is lawful. The reasons why a patient might refuse transfusion and the implications are examined. The processes and products that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable to Jehovah's Witnesses are described. When a team is faced with a patient who refuses transfusion, a thorough review of the clinical situation is advocated and all options for treatment should be explored. After discussion, a plan should then be made that is acceptable to the patient and appropriate consent obtained. When agreement cannot be reached between the doctor and the patient, referral for a second opinion should be considered. When the patient is a child, the same strategy should be used but on occasion the clinical team may have to obtain legal help.

### Management of jehovah's witnesses in otolaryngology, head and neck surgery [^1face313]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

It is imperative that surgeons should have some knowledge and understanding of the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses to respect the patient's wishes and effectively minimize and manage blood loss. The objective of this review was to provide a management strategy for Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing otolaryngology, head and neck surgery, because there is paucity of information regarding this within our literature. A systematic review of medical literature was conducted. Articles were identified using MEDLINE (1966–2007). The search strategy used Medical Subject Heading terms Jehovah's Witnesses, Beliefs, Ethical and Legal issues, Blood transfusion alternatives, ENT, Head and Neck surgery in Jehovah' witnesses. There is a broad range of nonblood surgical management strategies available in other specialities, making major surgery possible within this population. This review suggests recommendations in elective surgery, trauma, and emergencies.

### Jehovah's witnesses in the emergency department: what are their rights? [^1ea84aeb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The Jehovah's Witnesses Society is best known to outsiders for its refusal of blood products, even when such a refusal may result in death. Since the introduction of the blood ban in 1945, Jehovah's Witness (JW) parents have fought for their rights to refuse blood on behalf of their children, based on religious beliefs and their right to raise children as they see fit. Adolescent JWs have also sought to refuse blood products based on their beliefs, regardless of the views of their parents. Adult JWs have fought to protect their autonomy when making both contemporaneous and advance treatment refusal. The refusal of blood products by JWs raises ethical and legal dilemmas that are not easily answered. Do an individual's rights (namely bodily control, right to privacy, right to decide about life/death issues, right to religious freedom) outweigh society's rights (namely the preservation of life, the prevention of suicide, the protection of innocent third parties, and the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession)? Does the right to choose outweigh the value of human life? For doctors, conflict occurs between the desire to respect patient autonomy and the need to provide good medical care. The Watchtower Society (the JW governing body) imposes a strict code of moral standards among its members, and it is unlikely that individual JWs are making truly autonomous decisions about blood transfusions. While young children and adolescents are protected by the courts and conscious adults are afforded autonomy, dilemmas still arise in the emergency situation. This article examines the rights of young children, adolescents, and adults, focusing in the latter half on adults in the emergency situation.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^b9eb7cdb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Considerations in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients

In a life-threatening situation, parental consent is not necessary, and treatment including blood transfusion should not be delayed clarifying beliefs in the pediatric and adolescent population. There have been numerous court cases on behalf of children who were given blood transfusions against their parent's wishes. Courts commonly favor medical care citing the US Supreme Court case of Prince versus Massachusetts, a case of a child in 1943 who was religious canvasing on the streets which was deemed analogous to child labor. The court ruling stated "Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves".

Adolescents pose a separate dilemma, as the right to refuse versus consent to medical treatment in this population is state dependent in the United States. In an ethics review paper on the rights of Jehovah's Witness adolescents, Woolley notes "While many children raised in Jehovah's Witness communities may never experience the "outside world", the judiciary would be wrong not to give them that opportunity. Religion is a powerful persuading voice, but it is also an individual belief. A limited life experience cannot truly give one the opportunity to rationalize a belief that may eventually lead to death". Although many states now have mature minor laws, it must be noted that these typically allow the mature minor to consent to medical treatment, but often do not allow a minor to refuse medical treatment that is considered lifesaving. In emergency situations, preserving life is typically favored in the court over the wishes of a parent or adolescent. The bottom line is that in the case of an emergency, blood should be given. Once the emergency has stabilized, consent may be obtained from the parent or mature minor. In the case of refusal, a court order should be obtained to appoint a guardian decision maker for the patient.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^fc86b318]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

3) Legal and Ethical Aspects of Non Transfusion

It has been suggested that patients who receive transfusions following cardiac surgery had twice the long-term mortality risk than patients who did not receive transfusions. The administration of blood transfusions therefore appears to be an independent factor of death. If these results attain factual status, then for both medical and legal reasons, all efforts must be made to avoid recourse to blood transfusion not only amongst Jehovah's Witnesses, but in all patients. A review of the existing literature on methods of blood transfusion indicates not only a discordance in practice amongst medical teams, but even amongst members of the same team: yet the morbidity-mortality rates are ubiquitous in the first 30 postoperative days. Therefore, it appears desirable to replace these highly unsystematic methods of transfusion with a protocol of blood conservation which involves all members of the caring team. To undertake such a protocol is both medically justified and feasible.

### Management of pregnancy in a jehovah's witness [^ee55f5a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

In the successful management of a pregnant Jehovah's Witness, many issues must be addressed beyond those normally required for routine prenatal care. The clinician who undertakes such care should be well versed in the potential complications related to blood refusal, the antepartum management of anemia, and the intrapartum management of obstetric hemorrhage. Furthermore, these patients should be delivered in a tertiary care center because this increases their options for obtaining alternative management of hemorrhage. A woman who is well informed about her options can then decide exactly what she wants done in the event of a life-threatening obstetrical hemorrhage.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^bf18db4f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The Jehovah's Witness patient presenting with multiple acute traumatic injuries presents an ethical and practical dilemma. There are common misconceptions due to broad generalizations regarding blood refusal in this population. In reality, there is a spectrum of treatments from those that are universally refused, commonly refused, and commonly accepted. It is imperative for the treating physician to be aware of nonblood product options, strategies to minimize blood loss, and legal aspects of blood product refusal. The root of the ethical dilemma lies between the physician's will to practice beneficence being at odds with the patient's autonomy. This article will review the reasons for blood refusal, the range of potential alternative treatments, and an approach to treating Jehovah's Witness patients in the acute orthopaedic trauma setting.

### Management of anemia in patients who decline blood transfusion [^88620d67]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Declining a treatment modality should not be considered the same as refusal of medical care as illustrated by the management of Jehovah's Witness patients who do not accept transfusions. Over the years, a comprehensive set of strategies have been developed to meet the specific needs of these patients and these strategies are collectively called "Bloodless Medicine and Surgery" (BMS). The focus in BMS is to optimize the patients' hematopoietic capacity to increase hemoglobin (Hgb) level, minimize blood loss, improve hemostasis, and provide supportive strategies to minimize oxygen consumption and maximize oxygen utilization. We present 3 case reports that illustrate some of the challenges faced and measures available to effectively treat these patients. Under BMS programs, patients with extremely low hemoglobin levels, not conducive to survival under ordinary conditions, have survived and recovered without receiving allogeneic transfusions. Additionally, the valuable experience gained from caring for these patients has paved the way to develop the concept of Patient Blood Management as a standard care to benefit all patients, and not only those for whom blood is not an option.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^b4cf5240]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Specific consideration must be reserved to unemancipated minors and patients unable to understand and want. (Grade of recommendation: 1C)

There are patients who may decline blood transfusions for various reasons, most commonly due to religious beliefs. The most prominent group of patients in this category are the Jehovah's Witness (JWs) (Table 1). Some national well known health services and associations developed recommendations for surgeons caring for patients declining blood transfusion. In general surgeons highly value and respect patient autonomy and simultaneously desire to provide high-quality and effective treatment. On the other hand, exists necessity to contribute to prevent the death of a patient. This may be even more difficult to achieve in those patients whose death might be prevented by transfusing blood. To provide optimal care for patients who are JWs, surgeons should aim to respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. As this topic presents many different and articulated arguments, it is not possible to provide blanket guidelines or standards for the care of JWs and all those patients who may decline blood transfusion. The attempt to delineate precise recommendations about when and what to use blood product, especially in emergency setting, may bring serious unintended consequences. Each person declining blood transfusions, whether for religious or personal reasons, is unique, independent and possesses personal wishes, values, and beliefs about what is acceptable therapy. It is crucial that surgeons and patients accurately discuss what they may accept or not in term of blood product and also the circumstances and the criticalities that may present during emergency management of acute surgical or traumatic illness. It should be noted that many patients who decline blood transfusion (i.e. whole blood, red blood cells, white cells, platelets, plasma) for religious reasons will permit the use of cell salvage and many other blood conservation modalities. (See table below.) Moreover, many will accept derivatives of primary blood components ("blood fractions") (e.g. clotting factor concentrates, albumin, immunoglobulins). The community help is fundamental. In fact, many JW patients have already clarified their own beliefs regarding transfusions and usually have some documents outlying very clearly their preferences. Those patients declining blood transfusions very often present for treatment with relatives or other representatives of their faith helping them during the hospital admission and ensuring that their treatment instructions are respected. On the other hand, clinicians should conduct an informed consent discussion by offering information in language the patient will understand of the various therapeutic options and the risks and benefits of each option. Clinicians should avoid generalization and consult with individual patients as to what each one's religious conscience dictates. Some patients might accept products containing derivatives of either primary cellular components or plasma, or surgical or extracorporeal blood management methods, whereas others may refuse them. Such a discussion must be done without coercion. The right to privacy must be respected and the patient must have if needed the time to discuss alone with the doctors about their beliefs and requests. Physicians must respect each patient's will, but also explain the potential consequences of declining blood transfusion. During treatment, the patient is free to change his/her mind. In fact, some may very clearly state their preference to decline allogeneic blood transfusion in nonemergent and non-life-threatening situations but may change their mind if their life is a risk. All patients must be warranted the right to change their mind. It is the surgeon's responsibility to clarify, without any antagonism the patient's preference to decline transfusion is stable and would not change if there was a risk to life. In the emergency setting, whenever the patients may not have the capacity to express their will, the decisional process about if to proceed with transfusion or not may potentially delay the treatment and lead to the patient's death. Treatment delays can be avoided by reviewing an incapable patient's advance medical directive (Durable Power of Attorney), recent record of hospitalization, or speaking with the patient's appointed substitute decision-maker. If there is no clear indication of the patient's treatment instructions or relevant wishes, surgeons are on solid ground in treating the patient using all available modalities under the standard of presumed consent. When a patient has an advance directive clearly refusing allogeneic blood transfusion, that directive must be followed. In the case of unemancipated patients and or children the management must in general warrant the right of the patient to be cured. Legal tutors have limited right to manage certain life-threatening behaviours and it must be case-by case referred to the local country and state laws.

### Liver transplantation in jehovah's witnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single institution [^940a49de]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We herein presented the results of the largest LT program from deceased donors in JW patients that has been reported so far. Our experience shows that the risk-to-benefits ratio of LT can be maintained in selected adult JW patients provided that it is carried out at a very experienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary approach. We reported our experience in the aim to offer a template for a broader concept of transfusion-free surgery principles rather than as a focus on a technical achievement in such a complicated clinical setting. Anesthesiologists, as users of blood products, are called to lead a continuous re-evaluation process aimed at defining the most proficient approach to bloodless surgery and at contributing to the debate about benchmarking in difficult clinical scenarios.

### A young adult jehovah's witness with severe anemia [^67f666c8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Two of the most ethically complex situations in pediatrics are those involving families whose religious beliefs preclude the provision of life-sustaining treatment and those involving young adults who have reached the age of legal majority and who face decisions about life-sustaining treatment. This month's "Ethics Rounds" presents a case in which these 2 complexities overlapped. An 18-year-old Jehovah's Witness with sickle cell disease has life-threatening anemia. She is going into heart failure. Her doctors urgently recommend blood transfusions. The young woman and her family adamantly refuse. Should the doctors let her die? Is there any alternative?

### Jehovah's witnesses and autonomy: honouring the refusal of blood transfusions [^87789383]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

This paper explores the scriptural and theological reasons given by Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs) to refuse blood transfusions. Julian Savulescu and Richard W Momeyer argue that informed consent should be based on rational beliefs and that the refusal of blood transfusions by JWs is irrational, but after examining the reasons given by JWs, I challenge the claim that JW beliefs are irrational. I also question whether we should give up the traditional notion of informed consent.

Abstract

Surgery in head and neck district is often associated with bleeding as major complication and need of blood transfusions. Homologous blood transfusions may be unacceptable to some patient groups such as the Jehovah's Witness (JW) patients. Refusal of potentially life-saving treatment creates ethical dilemmas for treating clinicians. This is the first report in literature which examines the management and treatment of a female JW patient who underwent major surgical procedure for squamous cell carcinoma of the jaw with a high risk of hemorrage which rejected any possibility of blood and hemocomponent transfusion by virtue of her religious principles.

➢ Jehovah's Witnesses refuse allogeneic blood products based on religious beliefs that create clinical, ethical, and legal challenges in orthopaedic surgery, requiring detailed perioperative planning and specific graft selection.➢ Detailed perioperative planning is particularly important for procedures with high intraoperative blood loss.➢ Graft selection must align with Jehovah's Witnesses patients' religious beliefs, with options including autografts, allografts, and synthetic materials; this requires shared decision-making between the patient and surgeon.➢ A multidisciplinary approach, integrating medical, ethical, and religious considerations, ensures optimal care, with innovative techniques and open dialogue being key to successful outcomes.

Application Across the Globe

It is important to know your country- or state-specific laws regarding consent on this matter. In Brazil for example, a physician is bound by law to give a blood transfusion in a life-threatening situation even against the will of the patient. In the United Kingdom, the United States, and India, the will of the adult patient is overriding, even if it means certain death. In Russia, Jehovah's Witness religion was banned from the country by the supreme court in 2017, thus leading to further confusion.

Advance decisions ('advance directives', 'living wills') and 'Do not attempt resuscitation' decisions

Adult patients with capacity who anticipate future incapacity through illness may indicate their preferences for future treatment by completing an advance decision, to take effect if they do not have the capacity to consent to or refuse specific medical treatments. For example, patients may indicate that they do not wish to undergo life‐saving surgery if they suffer from dementia when they are older. Many Jehovah's Witnesses carry with them an advance decision forbidding the administration of blood or blood components.

Although an advance decision to refuse routine treatment does not have to be in writing, one to refuse life‐sustaining treatment must be in writing, must be witnessed, and must make clear that it is to apply to the treatment even if life is at risk 6. An advance decision that is valid and applicable to the treatment in question is legally binding 6. Wherever possible, anaesthetists should check whether a patient has made a relevant advance decision to refuse treatment.

When a situation falls fully within the terms of the advance decision, clinicians should respect the terms unless there is good evidence that the patient did not have capacity to make the advance decision, or that the patient has changed his/her mind since signing it 30.

Advance decisions cannot authorise doctors to do anything outside the law, or compel them to carry out a specific form of treatment, for example continue life‐sustaining treatment that is not in a patient's best interests, or provide a treatment the primary intention of which is to hasten death 22.

'Do not attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) decisions are not advance decisions. Consideration as to the likely appropriateness of resuscitation must, however, be based wherever possible on discussion with the patient (or, where the patient is unable to take part in the discussion, those close to the patient). Further guidance on DNAR decisions is available elsewhere 27. The Working Party is aware of current work being done to produce similar guidance encompassing wider emergency treatment, beyond DNAR alone (Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (previously Emergency Care and Treatment Plan); see).

Severe blood loss carries an increased risk of a fatal outcome in patients who do not consent to the use of blood products. For patients who base this decision on a religious belief system, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, important distinctions may exist between the appropriateness of various blood products. We describe the first successful use of purified human cell-free haemoglobin solution in a paediatric patient, in this case in the management of life-threatening anaemia in a 14-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with immune thrombocytopenia.

### The ethics of consent during labour and birth: episiotomies [^1944e13a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Situations can occur where patients are unable to consent, for example because they are unconscious. Here, treatment can still be permissible if the care provider can legitimately presume consent. But there are essential requirements for this exception to informed consent to be valid: there needs to be a medical emergency; the procedure is needed to prevent significant harm to the patient; and it needs to be impossible or impractical (ie, because it incurs medically unacceptable delay) to obtain consent from the individual or a third party who is authorised to consent on the individual's behalf. Finally, there should not be any reason to suspect that the patient would have refused if there was an opportunity to provide consent. For example, consent can reasonably be presumed when an individual is brought into the emergency room unconscious and care providers have to perform a life-saving blood transfusion, but not if the patient is a known Jehovah's witness.

Qualified consent

Some patients, for religious or other personal reasons, may qualify their general consent to treatment by refusing specific aspects of that treatment. Doctors must respect these wishes as far as possible.

Jehovah's Witnesses, for example, may differ in their interpretations of the acceptability of blood transfusions. Most Jehovah's Witnesses will refuse homologous blood transfusion; however, some will accept autologous or cell‐salvaged blood. Cardiopulmonary bypass with non‐haematogenous primes and organ transplantation are usually regarded as acceptable 29.

If a patient gives qualified consent, a record should be made in the hospital notes indicating that the patient has been informed of the likely consequences of this decision, together with the reasons why such a treatment was proposed in the first instance. If the patient remains adamant, attention should be drawn to the clause on the consent form that specifies the patient's right to list procedures for which consent is not agreed. The doctor should also make a note of the precise nature of the restriction that has been imposed by the patient and the explanation of risks that took place.

Qualified consent does not remove a patient's right to reasonable and proper care, including provision of all other forms of treatment that are appropriate in the circumstances. If an individual anaesthetist does not feel capable of providing proper care consistent with the patient's wishes, then he/she can refuse to treat the patient, provided that no additional harm is likely to result from that refusal, and make reasonable attempts to find a different anaesthetist who is willing to treat the patient. However, in an emergency when treatment is immediately necessary, the anaesthetist should attempt to comply with the wishes of a patient who has capacity.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^e8df726d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of acute blood loss anemia in patients who are Jehovah's witness with orthopaedic trauma injuries remains a moral dilemma and medical challenge. There are varying patient beliefs as to what is considered acceptable in the setting of acute blood loss anemia within the Jehovah's Witness community. Advancements have been made in pharmacologic options (iron replacement, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, tranexamic acid, clotting factors, artificial oxygen carriers) since the time of the religion's blood ban, as well as procedural interventions (interventional radiology, red blood cell salvage). There is minimal published evidence of the acute management of orthopaedic trauma injuries with acute blood loss anemia requiring ongoing orthopaedic surgeries in the Jehovah's Witness population. Management options can be extrapolated from other surgical fields and orthopaedic case reports to create a systematic approach to treatment. Management of patients who refuse blood products with acute blood loss anemia requires a multidisciplinary approach and strict clarification of the patient's beliefs. The goals of this article are to clarify Jehovah's Witness beliefs regarding blood transfusions, review management options available in the orthopaedic trauma setting, and propose a treatment algorithm.

### Ethical and medicolegal considerations in the obstetric care of a jehovah's witness [^ffd53f77]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Jehovah's Witnesses comprise a unique obstetric population. Their refusal of blood stems from an interpretation of a literal translation of the Bible, and it is this belief that puts them at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality if hemorrhage occurs. Many Jehovah's Witnesses feel that accepting a blood transfusion will lead them to eternal damnation. A patient's self-determination, or autonomy, allows her to make decisions regarding her care. The decision to refuse blood or blood products has been upheld in court. This brings a new twist to the physician's obligation to "do no harm". When one undertakes the care of one of these patients, it is important to understand the ethical and medicolegal ramifications. The decision to be the primary caregivers can only be made once the physicians have decided they can let the patient die when all other options have been exhausted. This commentary discusses the ethical concerns and reviews the alternatives available to a Jehovah's Witness.

### Liver transplantation in jehovah's witnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single institution [^1479abe0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The religion of Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) was founded in the nineteenth century and its community counts about 250.000 members in Italy. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or acute liver failure and its outcomes markedly improved over the last decades. Since the risk of life-threatening peri-operative bleeding in LT remains considerable and JW refuse blood transfusion on religious grounds, they always represented a tremendous clinical challenge and generated ethical and legal concerns when indicated to this procedure. At the University of Pisa, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria Pisana, we developed a peri-operative management pathway with strategies toward a transfusion-free environment with the aim not only of offering LT to selected JW patients but also, ultimately, of translating this practice to all general surgical procedures. Since there are so few LT centers willing to perform LT on JW patients and literature detailing their peri-operative care and outcomes is poor, in this report we describe our experience of LT in JW and analyze feasibility and safety and evaluate the optimal management.

### Treatment of acute leukaemia in adult jehovah's witnesses [^69d03ed0]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Since Jehovah's Witness (JW) patients diagnosed with leukaemia refuse blood transfusions, they are often denied intensive chemotherapy for fear they could not survive myeloablation without blood transfusion support. Treatment of JW patients with acute leukaemia is challenging and carries a higher morbidity and mortality; however, the refusal of blood products should not be an absolute contraindication to offer multiple treatment modalities including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this review we discuss their optimal management and describe alternative modalities to blood transfusions to provide sufficient oxygenation and prevent bleeding.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^c7852203]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient care when blood transfusion is not an option

Medical care without allogeneic blood transfusion (bloodless medicine and surgery) must be considered in a number of clinical settings: when patients decline allogeneic blood transfusion for religious (e.g. JWs, see Table 2) or personal reasons; when blood may be in short supply (e.g. trauma, mass casualty events, and critical inventory shortages continue to occur in Canada, the United States and some European nations since the pandemic); when safe blood (i.e. screened and tested) is not available (one out of four low-income countries do not test all donated blood for infectious diseases and 54% of countries do not have blood surveillance systems, according to the World Health Organization); when compatible blood transfusion may be unobtainable (e.g. for patients with multiple allo-antibodies). In each of the above settings, clinicians need to adopt of philosophy of rigorous blood conservation. Moreover, a philosophy of patient blood management that incorporates bloodless medicine principles is appropriate for all patients. Many reports of patients treated without transfusion for a variety of conditions show that preempting, minimizing, or avoiding of allogeneic blood is safe and effective. Bloodless medicine is still in the process of development and is not without limitations. Strategies for managing acute, severe anemia continue to evolve.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^8b057185]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Proposed Approach to Management

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols should always be followed. If Jehovah's Witness status is unknown, routine management should be followed. After confirming Jehovah's Witness status on arrival to the trauma facility, the patient's specific wishes should be clarified. If the patient is obtunded or intubated, the surrogate should be contacted. If no surrogate can be contacted, the hospital ethics committee should be consulted. In patients presenting in hypovolemic shock, one liter of crystalloid should be given in adults, or 20 mL/kg in patients under 40 kg, and response monitored.TXA should be given within 3 hours of the injury when possible. Proposed treatment protocol is reviewed in Figure 2.

Figure 2

It is important to note that wishes should be confirmed along the way as a patient's wishes may change as their prognosis changes. In their study on anemic trauma patients who were Jehovah's Witnesses, Olaussen et alnoted approximately 25% of patients elected for RBCs, FFP, or platelets. Patients should be counseled on increased mortality as hemoglobin decreases. In a study of 300 patients who refused blood transfusion based on religious beliefs, it was found that there was no increased mortality with or without cardiovascular disease with a hemoglobin level of 7.1 to 8.0 g/dL, but every gram per deciliter drop in hemoglobin below 7 led to a 2.5 increase odds of death. It must be remembered that hemoglobin will continue to decrease after admission to the hospital, with a nadir often occurring around hospital day 4.

The Jehovah's Witnesses Society (JW), a fundamentalist Christian sect, is best known to laypersons and healthcare professionals for its refusal of blood products, even when such a refusal may result in death. Since the introduction of the blood ban in 1945, JW parents have fought for their rights to refuse blood on behalf of their children, based on religious beliefs and their right to raise children as they see fit. Adolescent JWs have also sought to refuse blood products based on their beliefs, regardless of the views of their parents.

Religious Justification for Blood Product Refusal

The Jehovah's Witness faith began in 1870 in Pennsylvania, and now has over 8.7 million members worldwide, with 1.2 million in the United States alone. The group is known for its biblical literalism as well as refusal to accept blood products. The first hospital blood bank in the United States was established in 1937. In 1945, The Watchtower, a Jehovah's Witness magazine, announced the ban on blood transfusion citing four verses in the Bible. -

Genesis 9:4 "Only flesh with its life — its blood-you must not eat".

Leviticus 17:10 "If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people".

Deuteronomy 12:23 "Just be firmly resolved not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the flesh".

Acts 15:28, 29: "For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!"

The Watchtower later clarified their stance on blood transfusion in 1951 stating "… when sugar solutions are given intravenously, it is called intravenous feeding. The transfusion is feeding the patient blood and… (the patient) is eating it (blood) through his veins". While an individual's preferences may vary, the general consensus from the Jehovah's Witness church is that allogenic blood is generally not accepted, cell fractions, red blood cell salvage, dialysis are up to personal preference, and colloids, recombinant EPO, and recombinant clotting factors are generally accepted(Table 1).

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^c55e9c8d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery receive blood transfusion in 20–80% of cases. Certain studies suggest that half of these transfusions are unnecessary and can be avoided. Furthermore, multivariate analyses have identified blood transfusion as an independent factor for mortality in the long term. Patients and their kin, informed of the feasibility of surgery without blood transfusion have frequently opted for this choice. On the other hand the need for blood products is on the rise due to the aging demographic of the population, a reduction in the number of potential donors and an increase in the costs of transfusions due to increased vigilance over the quality of blood and more stringent sanitary measures.

Over the course of the last 21 years, we have performed cardiac surgery on 500 patients of the Jehovah witness faith which requires its followers to refrain from blood transfusions. In all of these cases, no transfusion was performed. Over this period, the techniques of blood preservation have improved greatly and have become rather systematized, together with an overall improvement in the operative risk of cardiac surgery. In order to measure the effects of advances in blood conservation techniques, we compared our first 250 Jehovah Witness cases to a subsequent group of 250 patients, paying particular attention to the impact of the introduction of preoperative erythropoietin (EPO) in the latter group.

### Overriding the jehovah's witness patient's refusal of blood: a reply to cahana, weibel, and hurst [^c6d39f7d]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article is a response to a survey on moral reasoning among Swiss health professionals that appeared in a recent issue of this journal. The authors of that survey inquired whether or not their respondents would give a blood transfusion to a Jehovah's Witness patient who clearly refused it. A substantial number of the respondents answered that they would override the patient's refusal and give the transfusion. The present article examines the two ethical rationales that were offered to explain the overriding respondents' answers and argues that neither one is ethically acceptable. It concludes with an account of the phenomenon of "motivated reasoning" that, so it is argued, better explains why the overriders would refuse to honor the Jehovah's Witness patient's transfusion refusal.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^e8875c4a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

No statistically significant difference was found between groups in the preoperative or postoperative period for hemoglobin and creatinine concentrations or platelet counts (Table 3). Among the control group, the mean preoperative hemoglobin value was significantly less in transfused patients (12.5 ± 2.1 g/dL versus 14.2 ± 1.3 g/dL for the non-transfused control group, p = 0.001, Fig. 1). This finding is indicative of the importance of "normal" preoperative hemoglobin levels to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Erythropoietin was administered to 4 Jehovah's Witnesses preoperatively for low hemoglobin and to 3 more during hospitalization for the same reason. Our center is especially interested in patient blood management strategies; therefore, we adopted a restricted transfusion policy for all the population we are taking in charge. In this study, only 17 of 62 (27.4%) patients in the control group were transfused with a total of 39 units of red blood cells. Eight of them received only 1 unit of red blood cells and four of them 2 units (Fig. 2). We can reasonably assume that some patients who received only one unit, were transfused to correct a possible hemodilution status frequently present at least until the 3rd postoperative day. These patients could have avoided blood transfusion if a more clinically-oriented approach had been used. Thus, although our transfusion rate is very competitive with regards to the literature, further improvement in blood saving is still possible.

Religious and cultural beliefs in pediatric care — examples include religious-based refusals of blood transfusions by patients who practice the Jehovah's Witnesses faith and refusal to seek medically necessary care by patients who are Christian Scientists; although adults with capacity may make decisions reflecting their faith even at risk of serious harm or death, there is a competing state interest in protecting a child from significant risk of serious harm; the AAP statement addresses that children, regardless of parental religious beliefs, deserve effective medical treatment when not overly burdensome and likely to prevent substantial harm, serious disability, or death; clinicians must balance collaboration with families with the need to protect children from serious and imminent harm, recognize that failure to provide appropriate care may constitute abuse or neglect and should not be unreported because of perceived exemptions, and note that such protection is extended until children are able to make such religious decisions for themselves.

### Perioperative management of four anaemic female jehovah's witnesses undergoing urgent complex cardiac surgery [^729a0abb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated that preoperative haemoglobin concentration and female gender are related to an increased need for perioperative allogeneic transfusions in cardiac surgery. Hence, urgent cardiac surgery presents a dilemma for female patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses, because of their refusal of allogeneic transfusion. This report describes the management of four high-risk anaemic female patients undergoing urgent complex cardiac surgery. In these Jehovah's Witness patients, strict application of a comprehensive blood-sparing protocol permitted safe avoidance of allogeneic transfusions. The protocol involved intraoperative acute normovolaemic haemodilution, intraoperative administration of tranexamic acid, intra- and postoperative use of a cell-saver system, postoperative administration of erythropoietin, iron and folic acid, and a careful surgical technique to avoid perioperative bleeding.

### Bowel injury in trauma: guidelines for diagnosis and… [^774145df]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

From the AFP Editors Traumatic bowel injury, including mesenteric injury, affects 1 in 5 cases of penetrating abdominal trauma and 1 in 100 cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Bowel and mesenteric injuries are challenging to identify in the context of multiple injuries; however, they need to be treated promptly to prevent significant consequences. The World Society of Emergency Surgery published guidelines for identifying and treating bowel injuries. Assessment After Abdominal Trauma Rapid assessment is essential in abdominal trauma because mortality increases by 1% for every three minutes in the emergency department. Initial assessment after trauma involves a primary survey for life-threatening injuries and a focused assessment with sonography for trauma evaluation. Immediate surgical consultation is recommended if the FAST evaluation finds intra-abdominal fluid, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients.

Peritoneal lavage, the withdrawal of abdominal fluid to assess for blood, has a lower positive predictive value than the FAST evaluation and results in unnecessary laparotomies. The importance of abdominal examination findings depends on the mechanism of injury and the presence of distracting injuries that may reduce examination accuracy. Although blunt abdominal injuries often lack external signs of injury, the seat belt sign represents a 12% risk of bowel or splenic injury. Similarly, children with abdominal bruising from bicycle handlebars are at increased risk of multiple abdominal organ injury including bowel injury. Missed Bowel Injury In blunt trauma, bowel injuries are often missed due to insidious presentation, the unreliable nature of physical examination in multiple-trauma patients, and initial nonspecific imaging findings.

Morbidity and mortality increase when surgical intervention is delayed more than five hours from the initial presentation. In addition to a high index of suspicion, serial examinations and repeat imaging are strongly recommended if nonoperative management is pursued in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Editor's Note: As mass shootings using high-velocity weapons previously limited to areas of conflict have become common, this guideline is sadly more relevant to our specialty. However, few of us have the time to pursue Advanced Trauma Life Support certification. There are many interesting elements of this guideline, such as the elevated risk demonstrated by abdominal bruising from seat belts or handlebars in blunt trauma, the limited accuracy of CT and laparoscopy in finding subtler bowel injury, and the resulting importance of serial abdominal examinations and the surgical options of wound exploration and laparoscopy. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Liver transplantation in jehovah's witnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single institution [^57638dc7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative management

JW patients were evaluated as per our standard Institutional clinical protocol. For this particular class of patients, two or more indicators of severe portal hypertension (platelets < 50 × 10 3 μL, grade 3 esophageal varices, ascites, previous variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy) were considered contraindications for listing as well as INR > 2.5 and stage 2 kidney injury according to the AKIN classification. Patients were deactivated from the list if, due to worsening of their clinical condition, they fell outside these criteria. Patients with previous upper abdominal surgery and UNOS status 1 and 2 were also excluded. Once indicated to LT and provided that involved senior surgeons and anesthesiologists agreed to perform the procedure, patients were requested to attend two interviews: one in presence of the next of kin and a JW elder and one alone with our centre's clinical leadership. All patients were required to sign a consent form that reflected their wishes formally refusing the use of blood products even in case of life-threatening anemia and stating the accepted therapies. In fact, since acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends on patient's free will apart from church doctrine, there are some therapies that all JW refuse (whole homologous blood and its main fractions: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and preoperative storage of autologous blood for later use during surgery) whereas there are some other treatments that most, but not all, Witnesses accept (perioperative blood salvage; products derived from the main components of blood, such as albumin, clotting factors, antithrombin III, synthetic hemoglobin, autotransplantation of stem cells, transplant of solid organs, normovolemic hemodilution). Finally, some other therapies are accepted by all Witnesses: plasma substitutes, which are not derived from blood, erythropoietin and hemopoietic agents obtained from genetic recombination. Therefore, all of the JW candidate to LT received detailed and written information about each of the available therapies. Following admission to the waiting list, patients showing an Hemoglobin (Hb) level < 12 mg/dL underwent hematological consultation in the aim to optimize their red cell mass. We developed a preoperative protocol for JW candidates to LT which includes supplementation with iron or vitamin (vitamin B12, folic acid) and subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin (40.000 IU weekly). The hematological package inserts also monthly laboratory checks and interviews in order to adjust treatments. Transplant candidates with Hb > 12 mg/dL were monitored with regular laboratory checks and, if necessary, they were included in the optimization protocol.

### Recombinant human erythropoietin use in a critically ill jehovah's witness after cardiac surgery [^069f7d89]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Complex cardiac surgery often requires blood transfusion. Some patients refuse transfusion, even when it is potentially life-threatening to do so. Although recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been used to reduce the need for blood transfusion, it has been considered ineffective in critically ill patients. The time course of hematological responses in a Jehovah's Witness patient with acute renal failure and severe cardiac disease suggests that a trial of rhEPO should be considered for salvage therapy in critically ill patients.

Implications

The authors describe successful treatment of life-threatening anemia using recombinant human erythropoietin in a critically ill Jehovah's Witness patient after cardiac surgery.

### Liver transplantation in jehovah's witnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single institution [^3e0ca360]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

However, experience is difficult to quantify and many unforeseen intraoperative events with the potential occurrence of technical difficulties impart complex changes predisposing to extensive bleeding. Furthermore¸ there is evidence that transfusional requirements can be reduced if the anesthesia team followed protocols including goal-directed transfusion practices. However, comparison of intraoperative transfusion requirements from different transplant centers may be inherently biased by an inability to account for differences in transfusion triggers and clinical practices. Consequently, the predictive models developed in one institution may hardly, if ever, be applicable in others.

Few other cases of LT in JW have been reported so far and, since the first one ever in 1994, our series is, to the best of our knowledge, the second most numerous overall and the largest from deceased donors. In fact, Jabbour and colleagues from University of Southern California reported in 2005 the results of 27 consecutive LT in JW patients, 19 from living and only 8 from deceased donors whereas Detry and colleagues reported 6 cases from Liege in Belgium. Other smaller case series are available from different countries.

It is undeniable that a rather diffused concern exists about offering LT to JW patients. In fact, the acceptance of solid organ transplantation and contemporary refusal of transfusion are hardly understandable for non-JW. However, it is important to remember that, as far as organ transplants are concerned, each Witness is called on to decide personally whether to accept them or not, with the proviso that no part of the transplantation process may include the use of blood or its main fractions. Therefore, each JW patient should be interviewed individually excluding external pressure and the use of every available peri-operative option aimed at a blood sparing management, including the use of factors and fibrinogen concentrates, should be carefully discussed and clarified. Since our patients have been transplanted over a period of 10 years, it could be argued that peri-operative management policies could have changed during this period with a possible effect of time on results. However, no substantial changes in clinical care of recipients were made during the considered period and there was also consistency in anesthesiology and perioperative treatments.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^f6f6dfbe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of our study support the view that cardiac surgery, including complex procedures and reoperations, can be performed in Jehovah's Witnesses provided rigorous preoperative preparations, perioperative hemostasis, and postoperative management. Moreover, we confirmed that there is no difference in terms of early postoperative mortality or serious morbidity between Jehovah's Witnesses and non-Jehovah's Witness populations. It would be of interest to compare the long term mortality between Jehovah's Witnesses and non-Jehovah's Witnesses after cardiac surgery in future studies.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^54c30af5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses refuse the transfusion of blood products, based on Biblical passages citing to "abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood" (Acts 15:19–20). Before major surgery, these patients are confronted with the stress of both the operation and the potential need for transfusion. The role of the health care provider is to assure the physical and psychological welfare of patients while respecting their philosophical and religious beliefs. However, despite the important evolution of blood preservation techniques, there is still a great risk for transfusion in cardiac surgery. Transfusion rates during hospitalization for a cardiac surgery procedure vary from 25 to 95%. In this context, cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses represents a real challenge, necessitating a close collaboration between the surgical, anesthesiological, and medical teams. However, due to the Jehovah's Witnesses' "natural experiment of blood abstention", the overall need for transfusion during cardiac surgery should be reevaluated. Recent studies did not find any difference in terms of mortality between Jehovah's Witnesses and a control group after cardiac surgery. Moreover, the deleterious effects of blood transfusions in terms of postoperative morbidity and long term mortality after cardiac surgery, along with the cost and shortage of available blood products, suggest tighter transfusion protocols. In this context, the investigation of surgical outcomes in Jehovah's Witnesses helps to evaluate the limits of transfusion safety and cut off points for transfusion, while improving the hospital care of this challenging group of patients. The aim of this study was to document our center's experience with complex cardiac surgery, including reoperations and urgent operations, in a non-selected Jehovah's Witness group and to compare surgical outcomes with a matched control group.

### Jehovah's witnesses requiring complex urgent cardiothoracic surgery [^a1892f7f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Blood-sparing surgical technique and perioperative medical management allows complex surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses. The authors review four cases of urgent cardiothoracic surgery performed on Jehovah's Witnesses. No lasting sequelae associated with either bleeding or end-organ ischemia were noted. Cardiopulmonary bypass management, meticulous hemostatic operative technique, and pharmacologic support of hemostasis and erythropoiesis permit this complex surgery.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^1b951fd9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The restraining factor in the implementation of such a protocol is cost, as the proposed blood conservation protocol relies upon two medications: aprotinin and EPO. Hence, the cost-benefit analysis depends primarily on the price of EPO. It must be remembered that EPO takes effect with some delay, its effectiveness is uncertain and, at present, its cost is prohibitively expensive. The extent of the delay in its effectiveness depends on the degree of preoperative anaemia. In France, EPO is used in the treatment of anaemia linked to renal failure, and occasionally preoperatively in anaemic patients.

The decision not to administer blood transfusions presents the medical team with an ethical dilemma as, in extreme circumstances, the members may be confronted with a situation in which a patient who could otherwise been saved must be left to die in order for their choice of non transfusion to be respected. Not only does this present an ethical dilemma for doctors but, in France, also presents a potential legal dilemma, since the preoperative consent form signed by the patient does not hold value, in light of the principal of " non-assistance to a person in danger ", which is in direct opposition to the voiced desires of the patient. It is thus held to be of the utmost importance to reduce all possible risks related to non transfusion in order to prevent the possibility of extreme situations in which such ethical and legal dilemmas may arise. We succeeded in this aspect in all cases except four who were conscious and repeatedly refused transfusion despite the propositions of the attending medical professionals. These preoperative exclusions account for the better results obtained in group B compared with the outcomes attained in group A. This rigorous selection process allowed us to propose standard techniques of treatment to all our patients, such as mitral valve repair and total arterial revascularization, a technique which enhances blood conservation. Redo operations did not present a problem as we systematically applied the technique described by O'Bryan which has not resulted in a single major cardiac event in over 300 re-operations. Nevertheless, these operative redos remain risky endeavors which must be evaluated on a case by case basis.

### Using acute hypervolaemic haemodilution as blood conservation technique in a jehovah's witness patient undergoing an emergency transphenoidal surgery: a sabah experience [^84b7fe4b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) is a branch of Christianity which was founded in 1872. However, their beliefs differ from other Christians in many ways. Majority of JW believe that it is against the teaching of God should they receive blood transfusion, while minority think receiving own blood or others is acceptable. These vast beliefs should always be respected by all medical practitioners to avoid medicolegal implications. The differing beliefs about blood transfusion is certainly a huge challenge to the surgeons and anesthesiologists, especially dealing with major surgeries. Thus, effective surgical and anaesthetic techniques are focused to minimise blood loss to avoid unnecessary blood transfusion. We report a JW patient who successfully underwent an emergency endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery secondary to pituitary apoplexy; highlighting our intraoperative acute hypervolaemic haemodilution technique to reduce blood loss.

### Liver transplantation in jehovah's witnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single institution [^a5c742cf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses represent a tremendous clinical challenge when indicated to liver transplantation because they refuse blood transfusion on religious grounds and the procedure is historically associated with potential massive peri-operative blood loss. We herein describe a peri-operative management pathway with strategies toward a transfusion-free environment with the aim not only of offering liver transplant to selected Jehovah's Witnesses patients but also, ultimately, of translating this practice to all general surgical procedures.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of prospective medical records of JW patients who underwent LT at our Institution. The peri-operative multimodal strategy to liver transplantation in Jehovah's Witnesses includes a pre-operative red cell mass optimization package and the intra-operative use of normovolemic haemodilution, veno-venous bypass and low central venous pressure.

Results

In a 9-year period, 13 Jehovah's Witness patients received liver transplantation at our centre representing the largest liver transplant program from deceased donors in Jehovah's Witnesses patients reported so far. No patient received blood bank products but 3 had fibrinogen concentrate and one tranexamic acid to correct ongoing hyper-fibrinolysis. There were 4 cases of acute kidney injury (one required extracorporeal renal replacement treatment) and one patient needed vasoactive medications to support blood pressure for the first 2 postoperative days. Two patients underwent re-laparotomy. Finally, of the 13 recipients, 12 were alive at the 1 year follow-up interview and 1 died due to septic complications.

Conclusions

Our experience confirms that liver transplantation in selected Jehovah's Witnesses patients can be feasible and safe provided that it is carried out at a very experienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary approach.

Patients declining blood products, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, warrant advance planning because refusal of blood products is common in this group and this subset of patients has between a 44-fold to 130-fold higher risk of maternal mortality from obstetric hemorrhage; because some may accept certain products, a predelivery directive that can be used in the event of a severe postpartum hemorrhage can be discussed during the prenatal period.

### Safety of cardiac surgery without blood transfusion: a retrospective study in jehovah's witness patients [^52accc50]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the utilisation of blood products and outcomes following cardiac surgery for 123 Jehovah's Witnesses and 4219 non-Jehovah's Witness patient controls. The study took place over a 7-year period at the Amphia Hospital in Breda, the Netherlands. A specific protocol was used in the management of Jehovah's Witness patients, while the control group received blood without restriction according to their needs. Patients' characteristics were comparable in both groups. Pre-operatively, the mean (SD) Euro Score was higher in the Jehovah's Witness group (3.2 (2.6) vs 2.7 (2.5), respectively; p < 0.02). Pre-operative haemoglobin concentration was higher in the Jehovah's Witness group (8.9 (0.7) vs 8.6 (0.9) g.dl(-1), respectively; p < 0.001). The total cardiopulmonary bypass time did not differ between groups. The requirement for allogenic blood transfusion was 0% in the Jehovah's Witness group compared to 65% in the control group. Postoperatively, there was a lower incidence of Q-wave myocardial infarction (2 (1.8%) vs 323 (7.7%), respectively; p < 0.02), and non Q-wave infarction (11 (9.8%) vs 559 (13.2%), respectively; p < 0.02) in the Jehovah's Witness group compared with controls. Mean (SD) length of stay in the intensive care unit (2.3 (3.2) vs 2.6 (4.2) days; p = 0.26), re-admission rate to the intensive care unit (5 (4.5%) vs 114 (2.7%); p = 0.163), and mortality (3 (2.7%) vs 65 (1.5%); p = 0.59), did not differ between the Jehovah's Witness and control groups, respectively.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^18cbb6c5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Between January 1991 and January 2012, elective cardiac surgery was performed on 500 Jehovah's Witness patients, all of whom gave informed consent with emphasis on the risks of non-transfusion. During this period, 622 patients were referred to our team and 122 were excluded (Table 1). Until 1998, 37 patients were excluded because their hemoglobin level was below 14 g/l, which was no longer the case afterwards due to the systematic use of Erythropoietin. Consultation with local ethics committee established inclusion and exclusion criteria, thus we excluded emergency procedures, congenital heart disease, cardiogenic shock, patients in whom a prolonged EPO treatment did not produce a hemoglobin level of 14 g, patients with problems of hemostasis or those in whom coagulopathy was anticipated following the implementation of extra-corporal circulation (cold agglutinin coagulopathy, sickle cell disease) and patients with thoraco-abdominal aneurysms in which we could not reasonably avoid transfusion. Three patients suffering from aortic dissection were excluded due to initial preoperative hemoglobin levels below 15 g/l. Three patients could not be operated upon due to it being impossible to attain sufficient levels of hemoglobin prior to the scheduled procedure, despite a month of EPO treatment. One of these patients showed signs of an increase in the size of a type 1 aortic dissection which became chronic following his refusal of a transfusion despite the advice of the care team. The other patient could not be operated upon due to a reaction to EPO of unidentifiable cause.

Table 1
Exclusion Criteria

The method of blood conservation utilized over the years has evolved, resulting in the adoption of the "Comprehensive Multimodality Blood Conservation Program" developed by Cornell University, detailed on Table 2. Aprotinin and EPO were used as dictated by protocol (Table 3). Aprotinin, which enhances erythrocyte hematopoiesis was used in all our patients according to Hammersmith Hospital protocol until its withdrawal in 2007, then aminocaproic acid is used in all cases. Prior to 1998, all patients with hemoglobin levels below 14 g/l were refused. After 1998, EPO was used systematically in all our patients with hemoglobin levels below 14 g/l prior to surgical intervention. The issue of cost did not arise as a factor as this medication was paid for by the patients. The relatively high level of hemoglobin was intended to extend the safety margin in these patients in whom postoperative transfusion was not an option.

### The value of history and goals of care with code status; even in an emergency setting [^712cf919]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

This is a case report involving an elderly Jehovah's Witness woman with a history of chronic anaemia who suffers cardiac arrest and is resuscitated. This case illustrates, even in an emergency setting, (1) the value of obtaining relevant history, (2) addressing code status within the framework of achievable goals of care and (3) the need to revise both history and goals of care, as more information becomes available. We also propose aspects of this discussion that would benefit from future research.

### Methods and principles in biomedical ethics [^6cc4f644]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

The four principles approach to medical ethics plus specification is used in this paper. Specification is defined as a process of reducing the indeterminateness of general norms to give them increased action guiding capacity, while retaining the moral commitments in the original norm. Since questions of method are central to the symposium, the paper begins with four observations about method in moral reasoning and case analysis. Three of the four scenarios are dealt with. It is concluded in the "standard" Jehovah's Witness case that having autonomously chosen the authority of his religious institution, a Jehovah's Witness has a reasonable basis on which to refuse a recommended blood transfusion. The author's view of the child of a Jehovah's Witness scenario is that it is morally required-not merely permitted-to overrule this parental refusal of treatment. It is argued in the selling kidneys for transplantation scenario that a fair system of regulating and monitoring would be better than the present system which the author believes to be a shameful failure.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^0f5bd0f7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventional Radiology

As with all trauma patients, interventional radiology should be consulted in cases where embolization may be an option. Use of inferior vena cava filters may be considered as certain medical treatments (such as EPO) can increase thromboembolic events. In severe anemia, thromboprophylaxis may be held, increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

Placement of a prophylactic intraarterial balloon can be considered in pelvic surgeries (such as acetabular fractures) with a high risk of blood loss because of inability to use a tourniquet. In a case report for a Jehovah's witness patient undergoing total hip revision for pelvic discontinuity, a prophylactic balloon was placed entering from the nonsurgical hip, threaded into the surgical common iliac artery preoperatively by an interventional radiologist. In the case that there was rapid uncontrollable bleeding, the balloon could be inflated. In the case that the bleeding persisted, the balloon could be withdrawn into the aortic bifurcation, and finally if the bleeding was still uncontrolled, it could be advanced into the aorta distal to the renal arteries. Of note, if the radiologist measured the distances for each of these options preoperatively in case uncontrolled bleeding occurred, the balloon could be inflated quickly. Use of a prophylactic intraarterial balloon has been described for pelvic and lower extremity surgeries in multiple previous studies with reduction in intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement in both in Jehovah's Witness and non-Jehovah's Witness populations. - Intraaortic balloon use must be weighed with the risks including thrombus, catheter dislocation, dissection, aortic, or balloon rupture.

Pediatric cardiac catheterization — consent discussion emphasizes that the discussion and consent should be age-appropriate for children and adolescents, and ideally, information should be provided at a 6th-grade education level; consent is usually taken from the legal caregiver in pediatric patients, which also applies to older patients if the patient does not have the capacity to understand a basic consent/assent discussion, and permission to transfuse blood products may need to be included in the consent (with specific accommodations for Jehovah's Witnesses patients).

### A single-center strategy to minimize blood transfusion in neonates and children undergoing cardiac surgery [^59a0aee4]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The transfusion of blood products in the setting of uncontrolled bleeding is unquestionably lifesaving. However, in many instances, the decision to transfuse is based on physician gestalt rather than medical evidence. When indications for transfusion are unclear, the benefits of blood products must be balanced against their significant risks and associated costs. As our institution is a referral center for patients of Jehovah's Witness faith, this population has pushed our development of techniques to achieve the goal of bloodless surgery. Our practices in caring for this population have become our standard practice for managing all patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery.

Objectives

To evaluate our success in minimizing the use of blood products during pediatric cardiac surgery.

Methods

After IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), for biventricular repair procedures. The study was conducted at a single institution (Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH)) during the period: January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013.

Results

A total of 209 patients were included. Overall, 81 patients (38.8%) and 81 of 136 (59.6%) weighing more than 6 kg received no blood products (bloodless) during their entire hospital stay. Bloodless surgery was most successful in patients weighing more than 18 kg, followed by patients weighing 6–18 kg. All 73 patients who weighed < 6 kg received blood transfusion during their hospitalization.

Conclusion

The techniques that we have developed to initially care for our Jehovah's Witness families may be applied to other pediatric and adult surgical procedures.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^45bdf380]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There was no significant difference in surgical outcomes. Hospital mortality was 3% for Jehovah's Witnesses versus 2% for control group, p = 0.548. The postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was similar between groups (p = 0.912). No stroke was observed in our series. One control patient had acute myocardial infarction but did not require a prolonged hospital stay. One Jehovah's Witness, who underwent surgery for an off pump coronary artery bypass, required 12 h of intra-aortic balloon pump support immediately after surgery. No significant differences were found in the lengths of the mechanical ventilation support (p = 0.218), the intensive care unit stay (p = 0.080), or the postoperative stay (p = 0.223, Table 4). Only 17 of the 62 (27.4%) control group patients were transfused with a total of 39 units of red blood cells concentrates (0.63 ± 1.5 units per patient, 2.3 ± 2.2 units per transfused patient). No Jehovah's Witness patient was transfused (Table 4, Figs. 1 and 2).

Informed consent and transfusion decisions for patients refusing blood products — ethical and legal considerations note that competent adults have a right to make informed decisions, whereas for unemancipated patients aged younger than 18 years life‑saving treatment generally cannot be refused; in emergencies it may be acceptable to transfuse such minors over objections, and when medically necessary outside emergencies surgeons may seek a court‑appointed guardian for permission.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^eea9041e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Refusal of heterogenic blood products can be for religious reasons as in Jehovah's Witnesses or otherwise or as requested by an increasing number of patients. Furthermore blood reserves are under continuous demand with increasing costs. Therefore, transfusion avoidance strategies are desirable. We describe a historic comparison and current results of blood saving protocols in Jehovah's Witnesses patients.

Methods

Data on 250 Jehovah's Witness patients operated upon between 1991 and 2003 (group A) were reviewed and compared with a second population of 250 patients treated from 2003 to 2012 (group B).

Results

In group A, mean age was 51 years of age compared to 68 years in group B. An iterative procedure was performed in 13% of patients in group B. Thirty days mortality was 3% in group A and 1% in group B despite greater operative risk factors, with more redo, and lower ejection fraction in group B. Several factors contributed to the low morbidity-mortality in group B, namely: preoperative erythropoietin to attain a minimal hemoglobin value of 14 g/dl, warm blood cardioplegia, the implementation of the Cornell University protocol and fast track extubation.

Conclusions

Cardiac surgery without transfusion in high-risk patients such as Jehovah Witnesses can be carried out with results equivalent to those of low risk patients. Recent advances in surgical techniques and blood conservation protocols are main contributing factors.

### Orthopaedic trauma management in the jehovah's witness population [^843e66b9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin-based Oxygen Carriers

Although an appealing concept, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) are not FDA approved and as such, they must be used with caution. Studies did not demonstrate improved benefits over allogeneic blood transfusions.HBOCs remain available as a part of clinical trials or for compassionate use, which unfortunately means it takes 24 hours on average to obtain the product; therefore, their use is not practical in the trauma population. Disadvantages include discoloration of plasma which may interfere with certain laboratory tests, as well as binding to nitrous oxide which may cause hypertension and tissue ischemia.

PolyHeme, a human-derived artificial hemoglobin, has been used in various case studies. HBOC-201 (hemoglobin glutamer-250 bovine; Hemopure, Biopure Corporation), a bovine-derived artificial hemoglobin, has demonstrated increased survival with earlier administration. Many of the previously studied HBOCs have been discontinued because of safety concerns during clinical trials because of the increased risk of myocardial infarction, life-threatening hypertension, and death. Although some Jehovah's Witnesses accept human-derived HBOCs, most accept bovine-derived HBOCs.

HBOC-201 may be considered when hemoglobin is less than 5 g/dL, or 5 to 7 with signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion. Each unit should be transfused over 4 hours and should increase hemoglobin by 0.63 mg/dL. The half-life is 19 hours, so repeat transfusions may be necessary. This protocol was written for Jehovah's Witness patients with life-threatening anemia, but based on a phase III clinical trial in elective orthopaedic patient populations.

Desmopressin

Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic derivative of vasopressin, acts by increasing plasma factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and tissue plasminogen levels. Administration of DDAVP will reduce activated partial thromboplastin time. Its use is poorly studied in trauma and orthopaedic patients but may be used in the case of previously known coagulopathy such as von Willebrand disease or mild hemophilia A. Owing to the relatively few numbers of orthopaedic studies examining desmopressin use, a recent Cochrane review was unable to ascertain whether a reduction in blood loss exists. Recommended dosing is 0.3 µg/kg single dose over 30 to 45 minutes.

### Lung resection surgery in jehovah's witness patients: a 20-year single-center experience [^fe6aedbb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternatives to allogenic blood may be considered and should also be addressed. There may also be a theoretical benefit of preoperative erythropoietin (EPO) treatment to increase Hgb levels prior to elective surgery. Unfortunately, the need for timely resections for a cancer diagnosis makes this strategy unattractive for many pulmonary resections and no patients in this series received EPO treatment. Studies available to date have not shown clinically meaningful differences in the outcomes between matched cohort studies of patients declining transfusion and receiving EPO matched to control patients declining transfusion and not receiving EPO. Other measures include preoperative vitamins (B6, B12, folic acid) and iron administration are reported in other surgical fields.

It is our hope that the results of this study may help address some of the ethical concerns regarding the increased risk of mortality and morbidity for JW's patients to undergo lung resection surgery. Despite the potentially increased risk of operative mortality, JW's should not be deprived of the necessary care for lung cancer based on the false assumption that refusing blood transfusions means that they do not want to consider surgical interventions. However, all parties, including surgeons, patients, and anesthesiologists, should fully understand and agree with the increased risk of surgical complications prior to operation. Rollins et al. investigated the personal experiences of six Jehovah's Witnesses who underwent major abdominal surgery at a single institution, and reported that all patients thought that faith helped them and their families to make the decision to opt for surgical intervention and to cope if faced with a life-threatening situation. The study further reported that JW's being well respected, understood and informed made the decision process of JW's to undergo surgery easier. JW's also tend to be compliant with other medical treatments and are often willing to pursue other types of interventions. As such, when consulting JW's, one may consider offering other non-surgical therapy for early-stage NSCLC such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). A meta-analysis based on 14 cohort studies reported that the odds ratio of 5-year overall survival between surgical management and SBRT for early-stage NSCLC to be 2.43, favoring surgical management. Yet, operative mortality for the NSCLC cohort in our study was 11%, which is much higher than 1% reported in the general population who received lobar resection for early-stage lung cancer. Given the increased risk of operative mortality from avoidance of blood products, one may thus consider offering SBRT for early-stage NSCLC to JW's.

### Proceedings from the society for advancement of blood management annual meeting 2017: management dilemmas of the surgical patient-when blood is not an option [^9884645d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Vigilance is essential in the perioperative period. When blood is not an option for the patient, especially in a procedure/surgery that normally holds a risk for blood transfusion, complexity is added to the management. Current technology and knowledge has made avoidance of blood transfusion a realistic option but it does require a concerted patient-centered effort from the perioperative team. In this article, we provide suggestions for a successful, safe, and bloodless journey for patients. The approaches include preoperative optimization as well as intraoperative and postoperative techniques to reduce blood loss, and also introduces current innovative substitutes for transfusions. This article also assists in considering and maneuvering through the legal and ethical systems to respect patients' beliefs and ensuring their safety.

### Safety of bloodless autologous stem cell transplantation in jehovah's witness patients [^cfd51399]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to the curative potential and improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the standard of care for several hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. ASCT typically involves support with blood product transfusion. Thus, difficulties arise when Jehovah's Witness patients refuse blood transfusions. In order to demonstrate the safety of performing "bloodless" ASCT (BL-ASCT), we performed a retrospective analysis of 66 Jehovah's Witnesses patients who underwent BL-ASCT and 1114 non-Jehovah's Witness patients who underwent transfusion-supported ASCT (TF-ASCT) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between January 2000 and September 2018. Survival was compared between the two groups. Transplant-related complications, mortality, engraftment time, length of hospital stay, and number of ICU transfers were characterized for the BL-ASCT group. One year survival was found to be 87.9% for both groups (P = 0.92). In the BL-ASCT group, there was one death prior to the 30 days post transplant due to CNS hemorrhage, and one death prior to 100 days due to sepsis. Based on our data, BL-ASCT can be safely performed with appropriate supportive measures, and we encourage community oncologists to promptly refer JW patients for transplant evaluation when ASCT is indicated.

### Use of cell salvage and HBOC-201 in a pregnant jehovah's witness with sickle beta + thalassaemia undergoing emergency caesarean section [^531e6022]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Patients with severe anaemia who refuse or cannot safely receive red cell transfusion present challenges during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period. Strategies including HBOC-201 (Hemopure) and intraoperative use of cell salvage have been used in non-pregnant patients to improve oxygen carrying capacity; however, these products pose unique risks in pregnant patients, those with sickle cell disease (SCD) and those undergoing caesarean section (C-section). We describe a case of a pregnant sickle beta+thalasasaemia patient who presented at 27 weeks gestation with pre-eclampsia and severe anaemia. As a Jehovah's Witness, she declined allogenic blood transfusion. The patient successfully underwent emergent C-section with cell salvage and received HBOC-201 immediately after delivery, during the operative procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first published report documenting a Jehovah's Witness patient with SCD who successfully received cell salvage and then HBOC-201 immediately postdelivery.

### REBOA in hemorrhagic shock: a unique non-responder? [^5a78feb0]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department after a ground level fall. On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically normal with an unremarkable primary survey. The secondary survey demonstrated pelvic tenderness to palpation. A pelvic radiograph and subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated left inferior and superior rami, sacral wing, and iliac bone fractures with pelvic hematoma and a focus of contrast extravasation. Approximately 1 hour after initial presentation, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 76 mm Hg. The trauma surgery team was consulted. On evaluation, the patient was alert with appropriate mentation. The abdominal examination was notable for tenderness in the lower abdominal quadrants. Radial arterial line confirmed SBP < 80 mm Hg, which was transiently responsive to intravenous fluid boluses. The patient carried a legal document and verbally stated that she was a Jehovah's Witness and declined transfusion of all blood products; however, she would accept autologous transfusion or cell salvage.

### Ethical decision-making: do anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurse anesthetists, and surgical nurses reason similarly? [^3124e831]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Principle-based ethical theory is currently available to guide health care professionals in clinical decision-making when they face ethical dilemmas. These principles include respect for autonomy (RA), nonmaleficence (NM), beneficence (B), and distributive justice. It is, however, unknown which principles, if any, guide physicians and nurses in this decision-making. The goal of our study was to explore how anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and nurse anesthetists reason in the face of a moral dilemma.

Methods

By an anonymous survey we asked: Would you give a blood transfusion to a young, ASA I, Jehovah's Witness who clearly refused transfusion, in a case of a life-threatening bleeding? What ethical principle did you apply in your decision?We presented this question before and after a 1-hour ethical tutorial about these principles.

Results

Twenty-nine anesthesiologists, 41 surgeons, 21 surgical nurses, and 33 nurse anesthetists participated in our survey. We found that 59%, 30%, 29%, and 36% of anesthesiologists, surgeons, surgical nurses, and nurse anesthetists, respectively, would give a blood transfusion despite the patient's demand. Nurses used B, surgeons NM, and anesthesiologists B and NM to justify transfusion. However, two among 11 anesthesiologists and five among 12 surgeons did not explain their choice. Those who tend to withhold blood transfusion overwhelmingly used RA as the principle behind this decision. Nine participants changed their view before and after the tutorial. There was no correlation between gender, age, and professional experience with the choice of principle. The average interest score for the tutorial was 74/100 for all participants after this ethical course.

Conclusions

Anesthesiologists tend to transfuse Jehovah's Witness patients more than did the others. Together with surgeons, they explicitly justify their decision-making less frequently when compared with nurses and nurse anesthetists. Further education in ethical theory is appreciated and needed.

### Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiogenic shock in a jehovah's witness patient [^0e6bb914]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) may support hemodynamics of patients experiencing cardiogenic shock refractory to medical management. We present a 62-year-old Jehovah's Witness female with a history of smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and anemia presenting with acute myocardial infarction and ensuing cardiogenic shock that required V-A ECMO support due to persistent hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia. Meticulous care to blood saving strategies were employed contributing to the successful management of the patient. These strategies included minimizing frequency of laboratory testing, use of micro-pediatric tubes, meticulous tissue handling to minimize blood loss during decannulation and administration of supplementary agents (vitamin B12, folic acid, iron, and erythropoietin) in consideration with the ethical concerns of the patients and their family. During the patient's hospital stay, their hemoglobin decreased from 14.6 mg/dL to as low as 7.6 mg/dL 3 days after decannulation. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of V-A ECMO support in a Jehovah's Witness patient and the first reported critical care case. In conclusion, employing a bloodless strategy and adhering to recommended practices can yield positive outcomes for patients who do not accept blood transfusions requiring V-A ECMO.

### Successful treatment of total placenta previa by multidisciplinary therapy in a jehovah's witness patient who refused blood transfusions [^da748196]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old Jehovah's Witness patient with total placenta previa was referred to our hospital at 30 weeks of gestation. She refused autologous and allogeneic blood transfusions, but agreed to receive acute normovolaemic haemodilution, intraoperative blood salvage and biological products. At 35 weeks, she underwent emergent caesarean delivery because of labour pains. Multidisciplinary therapy, including the insertion of balloon catheters into the bilateral common iliac arteries, acute normovolaemic haemodilution and intraoperative blood salvage, avoided hysterectomy; however, blood loss included amniotic fluid which was estimated to be 1910mL. These treatments may be effective for total placenta previa in blood-refusal patients.

### Jehovah's witness head and neck free flap reconstruction patient outcomes [^6db202ce]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian religious denomination that rejects the transfusion of whole blood and component blood products. Given new transfusion-free strategies, Jehovah's Witness patients are undergoing free flap reconstructions with increased regularity. However, outcome data remains limited. With this study, we sought to examine post-operative outcomes in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing free flap reconstruction of the head and neck, compare their outcomes to non-Jehovah's Witness patients, and enumerate strategies to enhance the safety of transfusion-free surgery.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was carried out on 10 patients who identified as Jehovah's Witness and 63 patients who did not. Demographic information, pre-operative laboratory values, peri-operative resuscitative interventions, and peri-operative outcome measures were compiled. Descriptive data analysis, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square tests, and multivariate analysis were used.

Results

Jehovah's Witness patients were significantly older than non-Jehovah's Witness patients (p = 0.03) and had significantly higher ASA scores (p = 0.009). Head and neck cancer was the primary surgical indication in both groups (p = 0.71). Jehovah's witness patients have significantly less intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011) and lower post-operative hemoglobin (p = 0.002) compared to non-Jehovah's Witness patients. While Jehovah's Witness patients had significantly higher rates of severe anemia (p = 0.014), there was no significant difference between the two groups in other post-operative complications and readmission rates even in a multivariate analysis accounting for age and ASA score.

Conclusions

Free flap microvascular reconstruction can be reliably performed on Jehovah's Witness head and neck patients without an increased risk of complication. Policies such as the use of non-blood volume expanders, albumin, Epogen, perioperative iron supplementation, cell saver and acute normovolemic hemodilution are key to ensuring good outcomes.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^d7e151aa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonrandomized comparative studies report higher risk of infection after RBC transfusion and case reports indicate that adverse outcomes including transfusion-related acute lung injury and delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction may occur after transfusion.

Recommendation 15: physicians must respect local laws and accept that competent patients have the right to decline blood transfusion. Physicians maintain the right and duty to decide whether they can perform a specific procedure without blood transfusion. If they cannot perform a procedure without blood transfusion, they should consider other therapeutic options.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^2db27524]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Supportive care for patients with AML who prefer not to receive blood transfusions — panel considerations: There is no established treatment of AML that does not require use of blood and blood products for supportive care, and with limited data, providing guidelines or recommendations for AML management in this context is challenging, and the Panel believes that in many cases, good outcomes from these strategies are rare. At the outset, it is important to discuss the goals of care with the patient and establish an understanding of the complications that can arise without transfusions, and it will be helpful to ascertain if the patient will accept certain blood products (eg, cryoprecipitate) and stem cells (either autologous or from another donor source). To mobilize peripheral blood stem cells and/or bring up hemoglobin levels prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, some treatment centers have used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), G-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics; however, before using this strategy, the potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties of using these agents in this context should be thoroughly discussed. Consider referring the patient to centers with expertise in bloodless autologous transplant, and for patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses and for this reason refuse blood transfusions, the U.S. branch of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses has Hospital Liaison Committees that may provide helpful information about bloodless medicine. Regarding treatment options, the Panel recommends considering less myelosuppressive induction including dose reduction of anthracyclines and use of nonintensive chemotherapy, and some options may include targeted agents guided by testing for actionable mutations instead of intensive chemotherapy, especially in a noncurative setting; however, the Panel notes that dose reductions in chemotherapy without transfusion support in patients with AML is associated with a lower rate of remission, high mortality by severe anemia, and is unlikely to result in durable remissions.

### Live donor liver transplantation without blood products: strategies developed for jehovah's witnesses offer broad application [^a28fc3a7]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Developing strategies for transfusion-free live donor liver transplantation in Jehovah's Witness patients.

Summary Background Data

Liver transplantation is the standard of care for patients with end-stage liver disease. A disproportionate increase in transplant candidates and an allocation policy restructuring, favoring patients with advanced disease, have led to longer waiting time and increased medical acuity for transplant recipients. Consequently, Jehovah's Witness patients, who refuse blood product transfusion, are usually excluded from liver transplantation. We combined blood augmentation and conservation practices with live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to accomplish successful LDLT in Jehovah's Witness patients without blood products. Our algorithm provides broad possibilities for blood conservation for all surgical patients.

Methods

From September 1998 until June 2001, 38 LDLTs were performed at Keck USC School of Medicine: 8 in Jehovah's Witness patients (transfusion-free group) and 30 in non-Jehovah's Witness patients (transfusion-eligible group). All transfusion-free patients underwent preoperative blood augmentation with erythropoietin, intraoperative cell salvage, and acute normovolemic hemodilution. These techniques were used in only 7%, 80%, and 10%, respectively, in transfusion-eligible patients. Perioperative clinical data and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Data from both groups were statistically analyzed.

Results

Preoperative liver disease severity was similar in both groups; however, transfusion-free patients had significantly higher hematocrit levels following erythropoietin augmentation. Operative time, blood loss, and postoperative hematocrits were similar in both groups. No blood products were used in transfusion-free patients while 80% of transfusion-eligible patients received a median of 4.5 ± 3.5 units of packed red cell. ICU and total hospital stay were similar in both groups. The survival rate was 100% in transfusion-free patients and 90% in transfusion-eligible patients.

Conclusions

Timely LDLT can be done successfully without blood product transfusion in selected patients. Preoperative preparation, intraoperative cell salvage, and acute normovolemic hemodilution are essential. These techniques may be widely applied to all patients for several surgical procedures. Chronic blood product shortages, as well as the known and unknown risk of blood products, should serve as the driving force for development of transfusion-free technology.

### Transfusion-free reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation in a jehovah's witness [^8dbb2c89]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

With an estimated 6000000 Jehovah's witnesses worldwide, haematologists may encounter patients who decline blood transfusions as a matter of personal belief. Here, we describe the first case of a transfusion-free allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in a Jehovah's witness with CML. The patient underwent HLA-identical peripheral blood SCT after reduced-intensity conditioning with total body irradiation and fludarabine. Conditioning and the period after transplantation were uneventful, complete donor chimerism was achieved and the patient continues to be in molecular remission without significant chronic graft-versus-host disease. When treating Jehovah's witnesses with diseases that may be cured by allogeneic SCT, this approach should be kept in mind.

### Cardiovascular surgery in jehovah's witness patients: the role of preoperative optimization [^e83e353b]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing complex cardiovascular surgery and to validate our preoperative optimization protocol.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 144 Jehovah's Witnesses who underwent cardiovascular surgery between 1999 and 2014. We excluded 7 salvage cases. The operative procedures included 56 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, 43 valve procedures, 13 ventricular assist device implantations, 11 heart transplantations, 9 aortic surgeries, and 5 congenital defect repairs. Our preoperative optimization protocol for Jehovah's Witnesses includes discontinuing antiplatelets and adding iron/vitamin or erythropoietin to achieve a target hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dL. We evaluated the risk factors for postoperative mortality and composite outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, heart failure, sternal wound infection), and compared the outcomes of optimized patients with a preoperative hemoglobin level greater than 12 g/dL (n = 93) versus unoptimized patients with a preoperative hemoglobin level less than 12 g/dL (n = 44).

Results

Preoperative and intraoperative demographics in the optimized and unoptimized groups were similar except for preoperative hemoglobin levels, renal dysfunction (optimized = 25/93 [26.9%], unoptimized = 26/44 [59.1%], P < .001), and emergency/urgent cases (optimized = 20/93 [21.5%], unoptimized = 17/44 [38.6%], P = 0.035). The mean preoperative, intraoperative nadir, and discharge hemoglobin levels of the entire cohort were 12.7 ± 1.7 g/dL, 9.5 ± 2.6 g/dL, and 9.7 ± 1.8 g/dL, respectively. Hospital mortality was 9 of 137 patients (6.6%) (optimized = 2/93 [2.2%], unoptimized = 7/44 [15.9%], P = 0.002), and composite outcomes were observed in 44 of 137 patients (32.1%) (optimized = 21/93 [22.6%], unoptimized = 22/44 [50.0%], P = 0.001). The Youden index identified a cutoff value of the preoperative hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL for mortality (area under curve, 0.719; sensitivity, 77.8%; specificity, 76.0%). Multivariate analysis identified a suboptimal preoperative hemoglobin (< 12 g/dL) as the only important independent factor associated with mortality (odds ratio, 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–42.18) and composite outcomes (odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–5.88).

Conclusions

Complex cardiovascular surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses was associated with acceptable surgical outcomes, especially if they electively completed optimization. Our Jehovah's Witnesses' optimization protocol targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 12 g/dL seemed to be effective in reducing adverse events at The University of Chicago Medicine.

### Intraoperative anemia and single red blood cell transfusion during cardiac surgery: an assessment of postoperative outcome including patients refusing blood transfusion [^1008e33b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Increasing evidence suggests benefits from restrictive red blood cell transfusion (RBC) thresholds in major surgery and critically ill patients. However, these benefits are not obvious in cardiac surgery patients with intraoperative anemia. The authors examined the association between uncorrected hemoglobin (Hb) levels and selected postoperative outcomes as well as the effects of RBCs.

Design

Cohort study with prospectively collected data from a cardiac surgery registry.

Setting

A major cardiac surgical hospital within the Netherlands, which is also a referral center for Jehovah's Witnesses.

Participants

Patients (23,860) undergoing cardiac surgery between 1997 and 2013.

Interventions

Comparisons were done in patients with intraoperative nadir Hb < 8 g/dL and/or an Hb decrease ≥ 50%. Comparison (A) between Jehovah's Witnesses (Witnesses) and matched non-Jehovah's Witnesses (non-Witnesses) transfused with 1 unit of RBC, and comparison (B) between patients given 1 unit of RBC intraoperatively versus matched non-transfused patients.

Measurements and Main Results

Postoperative outcomes were myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy, stroke, and death. With propensity matching, the authors optimized exchangeability of the compared groups. Adverse outcomes increased with a decreasing Hb both among Witnesses and among non-Witnesses. The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ between Witnesses and matched non-Witnesses who received RBC (adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.63–3.29). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between patients who received a red cell transfusion and matched patients who did not (adjusted odds ratio 0.94, confidence interval 0.72–1.23).

Conclusion

Intraoperative anemia is associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery, and a single RBC transfusion does not seem to influence these outcomes.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^1b19ea44]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current study we presented the outcomes after cardiac surgery for a non-selected group of Jehovah's Witnesses (n = 31) operated in our cardiac surgery department from 1991 to 2012. Outcomes and demographic variables were compared with a matched control group (n = 62) as described above. No difference was demonstrated in terms of hospital mortality, in-hospital morbidity, or the intensive care or hospital length of stay. Hemoglobin levels remained similar between groups, both pre- and postoperatively.

Previous, non-comparative studies provided evidence that cardiac surgery can be safely performed in Jehovah's Witnesses, with acceptable outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity. Moreover, a literature search identified four retrospective comparative studies evaluating cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses in comparison to a control group of patients. Three studies compared outcomes after cardiac surgery between Jehovah's Witnesses and a control group of matched transfused patients and another one between Jehovah's Witnesses and a matched group regardless of blood transfusion. A comparison of the major demographic data and surgical outcomes between our study and previous comparative studies is shown in Table 5.

Table 5

Our Jehovah's Witness group differed significantly from other studies regarding the type of cardiac surgery procedures. Patients underwent a variety of high risk surgical procedures, including urgent operations, reoperations, double valve surgery, combined valve and coronary surgery and ascending aorta procedures (Tables 2, 5). More precisely, in our group only 54% of all procedures were isolated coronary bypass surgery; whereas, El Azab et al. reported more than 90% coronary by-pass surgeries for the Jehovah's Witness group. In the other three studies, which compared Jehovah's Witnesses to a matched transfused group, coronary bypass surgery accounted for 51%, 65%, and 78% of all cases. Moreover, in our study, 10% of all procedures were reoperations, which were not reported in the other studies (Table 5).

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^743f5ebc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) general supportive care for patients who prefer not to receive blood transfusions includes the following: There is no established treatment of AML that does not require the use of blood and blood products for supportive care. Discuss goals of care and understanding of complications without transfusion, clarify acceptance of certain blood products (eg, cryoprecipitate) under certain circumstances including whether stem cells (donor or autologous) will be acceptable, and minimize risk of bleeding including consideration for use of oral contraceptive pills or medroxyprogesterone acetate in menstruating individuals; proton pump inhibitor, aggressive antiemetic prophylaxis, and stool softeners are advised to reduce risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed; nasal saline sprays are advised to reduce epistaxis; and fall precautions are advised, particularly in patients with thrombocytopenia. Avoid concomitant medicines or procedures that can increase the risk of bleeding or myelosuppression; consider using vitamin K (to potentially reverse coagulopathy) and aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid in patients at risk of bleeding (eg, when platelet count drops below 30 × 10⁹/L) or for management of bleeding; consider use of aminocaproic acid rinses for oral bleeding or significant mucositis that could result in bleeding; consider using acetaminophen to manage fever; consider iron, folate, and vitamin B12 supplementation if deficient with iron supplementation avoided in someone with excess iron levels; consider use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), G-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics after a thorough discussion of potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties; and consider bed rest and supplemental oxygenation in patients with severe anemia. For Jehovah's Witnesses, the United States Branch of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witness has a Hospital Liaison Committee that can provide helpful information about bloodless medicine.

### Hemopure transfusion in a child with severe anemia [^80b7565c]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

A 23-month-old girl presented with heart failure from extremely severe sickle cell anemia. The family refused blood transfusion on religious grounds (Jehovah's Witness). Alternative options acceptable to this religion, such as iron, erythropoietin, or folic acid were rejected as useless in the particular situation of the child. The patient was transfused with Hemopure, a product that consists of polymerized bovine hemoglobin. This is the first case reported in the literature of a child transfused, in an emergency situation, with this product.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^9a3c3a29]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Mature-minor doctrine and adolescent refusal of life-sustaining treatment — case law cited includes In re E.G. (1989), in which the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a 17-year-old with leukemia who was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith was mature and had the right to refuse blood transfusions; the judges observed that the age of majority "is not an impenetrable barrier that magically precludes a minor from possessing and exercising certain rights normally associated with adulthood". Belcher v Charleston Area Medical Center (1992) recognized the mature-minor doctrine and directed physicians to seek input from a mature minor; in that case a do-not-resuscitate order for a 17-year-old was written without patient discussion and he died without resuscitation. In the 13-year-old Daniel Hauser case, Hodgkin lymphoma had an estimated survival of 80% to 95% after standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and a 2009 Minnesota court found parental rights and religious belief less compelling than the state's need to protect the child and to proceed with necessary medical therapy. By contrast, a 14-year-old with leukemia, Dennis Lindberg, was allowed to refuse a blood transfusion after a 2007 court ruling and died within hours of the ruling. In 2006, a 16-year-old with lymphoma, Abraham Starchild Cherrix, successfully deferred standard therapy under a Virginia court ruling that quickly resulted in Virginia's 2007 "Abraham's Law" that allows adolescents 14 years of age and older a decision-making role in life-threatening conditions.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^b7525a61]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Pre‐operative:
All patients should have their haemoglobin concentration measured before listing for major elective surgery.
Where blood transfusion is anticipated, this and alternatives to transfusion should be discussed with the patient before surgery, and their consent should be documented according to local protocols.

Minimising peri‐operative blood loss:
3 Management of anticoagulants in the peri‐operative period should balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.
4 The use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is recommended in all patients who are bleeding, where blood loss > 500 mL (> 8 ml.kg ‐1 in children weighing > 10 kg) is possible and/or in patients are unable to receive donor blood.
5 Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately.

Recognition and management of major bleeding:
Early recognition of obstetric bleeding is essential and should be measured accumulatively, leading to a clear escalation plan of intervention and involvement of the multidisciplinary team.
Every institution should have a major haemorrhage protocol which is regularly audited and reviewed. They should be concise but targeted, and allow for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components.
In an emergency, surgical implementation of damage/proximal control strategies may be required until haemorrhage control is achieved.
Group O red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion should be readily available in the clinical area, in case haemorrhage is life‐threatening. Group‐specific RBCs should be made available by the laboratory as soon as possible after receiving correctly labelled samples and being informed of the emergency requirement for blood, and according to local laboratory protocols.
During major haemorrhage due to trauma, preference should be given to transfusing RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Clear fluids (crystalloids) should be avoided unless there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components.
Blood components should be prescribed for children as a volume (ml.kg ‐1) rather than in units.
Patients who continue to bleed actively should be monitored by point‐of‐care and/or regular laboratory tests for coagulation, fibrinogen and platelet counts and/or function. A guide for transfusion should be: FFP if INR > 1.5; cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 1.5 g.l ‐1 (< 2.0 g.l ‐1 in obstetrics); and platelets if platelet count < 50 × 10 9.l ‐1 (< 75 × 10 9.l ‐1 in obstetrics).

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^c305aeb5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency general surgeons often provide care to severely ill patients requiring surgical interventions and intensive support. One of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality is perioperative bleeding. In general, when addressing life threatening haemorrhage, blood transfusion can become an essential part of overall resuscitation. However, under all circumstances, indications for blood transfusion must be accurately evaluated. When patients decline blood transfusions, regardless of the reason, surgeons should aim to provide optimal care and respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. The aim of this position paper was to perform a review of the existing literature and to provide comprehensive recommendations on organizational, surgical, anaesthetic, and haemostatic strategies that can be used to provide optimal peri-operative blood management, reduce, or avoid blood transfusions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Temporary partial intra-iliac balloon occlusion for the treatment of acetabulum fracture in a jehovah's witness: a case report [^b50dca89]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2005). Low credibility.

Blunt trauma patients with acetabular fractures can lose as much as 2 L of blood after injury, and approximately 40% of these patients require blood transfusions. Fractures involving the anterior and posterior columns may require more than 1 surgery for adequate fracture fixation, increasing the potential for greater blood loss. Although blood transfusions may be medically necessary in these cases, Jehovah's Witnesses often refuse transfusion as a matter of religious conviction. The religious tenets of this faith preclude the use of blood transfusions and certain other blood products, based on an interpretation of Acts 15:29. To treat patients with these beliefs, various techniques have been developed to minimize blood loss as an alternative to transfusion. Temporary arterial balloon occlusion, also known as an "internal tourniquet", was first reported in 1954 for use in severe penetrating abdominal trauma. It was later used to control basilar artery bleeding and to limit blood loss in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing revision total hip or knee arthroplasty. This case report documents the successful use of temporary balloon occlusion to minimize blood loss during an open reduction internal fixation of a both-column acetabulum fracture in a Jehovah's Witness patient. The method used for achieving this intra-iliac balloon occlusion is described in detail so that others also may implement this technique.

### Patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review [^dc6a8bd7]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

As COVID–19 disease escalates globally, optimising patient outcome during this catastrophic healthcare crisis is the number one priority. The principles of patient blood management are fundamental strategies to improve patient outcomes and should be given high priority in this crisis situation. The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and healthcare authorities with information regarding how to apply established principles of patient blood management during the COVID–19 pandemic. In particular, this review considers the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic on blood supply and specifies important aspects of donor management. We discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID–19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery. In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID–19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID–19. Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply‐demand and cost‐benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID–19 pandemic.

### What emergency physicians should know about informed consent: legal scenarios, cases, and caveats [^8ec6d76c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The basic concept of obtaining informed consent is familiar to emergency physicians, and many consider themselves well versed on the topic; however, lack of obtaining proper informed consent is a frequent source of lawsuits. The legal definitions and nuances of informed consent might surprise even the most experienced physician. This article will detail the historical legal evolution of the concept of informed consent. It will also report defining and recent court cases that illustrate the current medical-legal status of informed consent. Special scenarios, caveats, and documentation recommendations are discussed. After reading this article the emergency physician will know how to practice and document the appropriate aspects of informed consent in emergency medicine, as well as understand available legal defenses if a lawsuit should arise.

### Patients' choice, consent, and ethics in patient blood management [^defdad04]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The goal of patient blood management (PBM) is to optimize clinical outcomes for individual patients by managing their blood as a precious and unique resource to be safeguarded and managed judiciously. A corollary to successful PBM is the minimization or avoidance of blood transfusion and stewardship of donated blood. The first is achieved by a multidisciplinary approach with personalized management plans shared and decided on with the patient or their substitute. It follows that the physician-patient relationship is an integral component of medical practice and the fundamental link between patient and doctor based on trust and honest communication. Central to PBM is accurate and timely diagnosis based on sound physiology and pathophysiology as the bedrock on which scientifically based medicine is founded. PBM in all disease contexts starts with the questions, "What is the status of the patient's blood?" "If there are specific abnormalities in the blood, how should they be managed?" and "If allogeneic blood transfusion is considered, is there no reasonable alternative therapy?" There are compelling scientific reasons to implement a nontransfusion default position when there is clinical uncertainty and questionable evidence of clinical efficacy for allogeneic blood transfusion due to known potential hazards. Patients must be informed of their diagnosis, the nature, severity and prognosis of the disease, and treatment options along with risks and benefits. They should be involved in decision-making regarding their management. However, as part of this process, there are multifaceted medical, legal, ethical, and economic issues, encompassing shared decision-making, patient choice, and informed consent. Furthermore, variability in patient circumstances and preferences, the complexity of medical science, and the workings of health care systems in which consent takes place can be bewildering, not only for the patient but also for clinicians obtaining consent. Adding "patient" to the concept of blood management differentiates it from "donor" blood management to avoid confusion and the perception that PBM is a specific medical intervention. Personalized PBM is tailoring the PBM to the specific characteristics of each patient. With this approach, there should be no difficulty addressing the informed consent and ethical aspects of PBM. Patients can usually be reassured that there is nothing out of order with their blood, in which case the focus of PBM is to keep it that way. In some circumstances, a hematologist may be involved as a patient's blood advocate when abnormalities require expert involvement while the primary disease is being managed.

### Innovative blood transfusion strategies to address global blood deserts: a consensus statement from the blood delivery via emerging strategies for emergency remote transfusion (blood DESERT) coalition [^cd3a0ca5]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

The concept of a blood desert is important for understanding the barriers to access essential medical and surgical care. In a mounting human tragedy, hundreds of millions — if not billions — of patients and their providers live and work in the world's blood deserts, faced with the bleak prospect of receiving or delivering medical care without access to blood. WBBs, IAT, and DBD are interventions that have initial safety data and clinical plausibility and should be urgently considered and implemented where appropriate. In the absence of reasonable alternatives, clinicians should weigh the near certainty of death and disability without access to timely blood transfusion against the lesser risks of transfusion delivered by these mechanisms. Researchers and policy makers should take steps to evaluate, improve, and implement sustainable solutions to the blood crisis.

### Settling for second best: when should doctors agree to parental demands for suboptimal medical treatment? [^7479d147]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients' opinions, beliefs and values hold an important place in clinical decision making in modern medicine. A competent patient may refuse treatment for themselves on religious or non-religious grounds and a doctor must respect this decision, even if they consider it to be irrational. However, this is more complicated when the individual is making decisions on behalf of another (eg, a parent making treatment decisions for their child). Parents' right to make medical treatment decisions on behalf of their child is not unlimited.

There has been research into the ethics of parental refusal of treatment, for example, Jehovah's Witness parents who refuse a blood transfusion for their children. In cases where the life of the child is at risk, it is widely accepted that doctors should over-ride parents' wishes. But the question of what doctors should do when parents are not refusing treatment, rather requesting a substitute 'second best' treatment, has attracted less attention. Box 1 describes a paradigm example of such a case.

Box 1
An example request for substitute suboptimal treatment. (A substitute treatment is defined as suboptimal if it is less effective and/or more costly than the standard treatment)

A very premature baby has just been born. The neonate is seriously ill and in intensive care with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a common complication of prematuritycaused by a deficiency of surfactant. Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) is a highly effective treatment for RDS, which reduces the risk of air leak, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and neonatal mortality. However, the parents of this child have an objection to the prescribed medication because they are Muslim and the medication contains pork-derived ingredients which they consider haram (forbidden by Allah).(This medication may also receive objections from Jewish parents, as well as parents who are vegetarian, vegan or have an interest in animal rights.) The parents have requested a substitute preparation of surfactant.
