## Question

Does hypothyroidism cause atrial flutter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hypothyroidism causes atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and whether the literature treats them separately or together. Then, I should verify what high-quality cohort and Mendelian randomization studies say about hypothyroidism and incident atrial arrhythmias. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility for hypothyroidism promoting flutter. After that, I should review guideline positions and consider confounders like amiodarone. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical implications for practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities so I don't conflate AF and AFL. Atrial flutter is a macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia, typically right atrial and cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent, with regular atrial activity and risk of 1:1 AV conduction, whereas atrial fibrillation is irregular and chaotic. Both are supraventricular and share risk factors, but they are distinct rhythms with overlapping substrates and treatments.

> Wait, let me verify how the literature handles this distinction. Most large epidemiologic studies combine AF and flutter or focus on AF, so direct AFL-specific data are sparse. For example, the Danish registry analysis of hyperthyroidism explicitly included atrial flutter alongside AF, noting flutter comprised a minority of events, which signals that hyperthyroidism is a recognized driver of both rhythms, albeit with stronger evidence for AF than for isolated flutter [^114BNMVp].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on hypothyroidism and incident atrial arrhythmias. Large population-based cohorts consistently show that overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with a lower risk of incident atrial fibrillation compared with euthyroid individuals, with incidence rate ratios around 0.67–0.87, and this inverse association persists after adjustment for comorbidities and in sensitivity analyses [^111WkjB2] [^1163d9ig]. Hold on, I should verify consistency: yes, multiple independent cohorts replicate this protective signal for hypothyroidism versus AF, strengthening inference even though these are observational data [^111WkjB2] [^115WiDQB].

> I will now examine causal inference using Mendelian randomization, because observational associations can be confounded. MR studies show that genetically higher TSH (indicating lower thyroid hormone activity) is associated with a lower risk of AF, whereas genetically determined lower TSH and hyperthyroidism increase AF risk, supporting a causal protective effect of higher TSH/hypothyroidism on AF susceptibility rather than a harmful one [^111hNaHL] [^115WiDQB] [^113CepMH]. Let me double-check that these effects are specific to AF and not broadly cardiovascular; indeed, the signal is strongest for AF and less consistent for other CVDs, which aligns with a targeted arrhythmic pathway [^113CepMH].

> But wait, what if the question is specifically about flutter rather than AF? I need to check whether any direct evidence links hypothyroidism to incident flutter. I do not find robust cohort data isolating incident atrial flutter in hypothyroidism; most studies either combine AF/flutter or focus on AF, and those that mention flutter are typically in the context of hyperthyroidism rather than hypothyroidism, so the direct evidence for hypothyroidism causing flutter is essentially absent [^114BNMVp]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it does mean I should be cautious about asserting causality for flutter specifically.

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Hypothyroidism is classically associated with bradycardia, reduced heart rate variability, and less atrial ectopy, which would be expected to lower the likelihood of tachyarrhythmias like AF and flutter that rely on triggered activity and reentry. In contrast, hyperthyroidism shortens atrial refractory periods and increases automaticity, explaining its strong link to AF and flutter [^116w185N] [^117H1FU9]. Hmm, wait a minute, could hypothyroidism still promote fibrosis and thereby flutter substrates? Animal data suggest hypothyroidism can increase atrial fibrosis, but human data linking this to clinically manifest flutter are limited and inconsistent, so I should not over-interpret preclinical findings without supportive clinical outcomes data [^115nWDUG].

> I should confirm what guidelines say, because they often codify the weight of evidence. Contemporary AF guidelines emphasize hyperthyroidism as a reversible cause of AF and recommend screening and treatment, but they do not list hypothyroidism as a cause of AF or flutter, which indirectly supports the notion that hypothyroidism is not considered a causal driver of these arrhythmias in routine practice [^111PxcYM] [^115qZxwd]. Let me reconsider: guidelines also advise checking thyroid function in new AF, but that is primarily to uncover hyperthyroidism, not to implicate hypothyroidism as an etiology [^115qZxwd].

> Hold on, I should verify potential confounders. Some patients with AF/flutter are on amiodarone, which can cause hypothyroidism; in that scenario, the arrhythmia may precede the hypothyroid state, and the thyroid dysfunction is a consequence rather than a cause, so attributing flutter to hypothyroidism in such cases would be incorrect. This is a classic reverse causation pitfall that can mislead interpretation if not accounted for [^115cXa2K] [^1113fAZY]. I need to ensure that any inference about causality avoids conflating treatment-induced thyroid disease with disease-induced arrhythmia [^115cXa2K].

> Let me synthesize. Direct evidence that hypothyroidism causes atrial flutter is lacking. High-quality cohorts and MR analyses consistently show that hypothyroidism is associated with a lower risk of incident AF, and by extension, given shared substrates and the predominance of AF in the literature, it is unlikely that hypothyroidism meaningfully increases flutter risk. Mechanistically, hypothyroidism's bradycardic and anti-ectopic phenotype argues against a pro-flutter effect, though isolated studies in ablation cohorts suggest higher recurrence in patients with higher TSH; those findings are hypothesis-generating and not proof of causation for incident flutter [^111WkjB2] [^111hNaHL] [^117H1FU9] [^111XWhDB]. I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty; yes, the balance of evidence indicates no causal increase in flutter from hypothyroidism, with the caveat that most data are AF-focused and observational [^111WkjB2] [^111hNaHL].

> Clinically, I need to ensure I don't miss the real message. If a patient with flutter is found to be hypothyroid, I should treat the thyroid disorder on its own merits, but I should not attribute the flutter to hypothyroidism; instead, I should evaluate standard flutter drivers and substrates and manage the arrhythmia per guideline-directed therapy, including rate control, anticoagulation when indicated, and consideration of cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for definitive therapy [^117H1FU9] [^117FRYyx]. But wait, what if the patient is on amiodarone? In that case, I should confirm whether the hypothyroidism is iatrogenic and reassess the arrhythmia management plan accordingly, recognizing that the thyroid issue is a side effect rather than the cause of the flutter [^115cXa2K] [^1113fAZY].

Hypothyroidism does not cause atrial flutter; in fact, it is associated with a **lower risk** of atrial fibrillation/flutter compared with euthyroid states [^111WkjB2]. The main concern is **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism** from overtreatment with levothyroxine, which can precipitate atrial flutter [^114nqY3A] [^113HQym7]. Clinicians should monitor TSH to keep it in the normal range and avoid excessive dosing that could trigger arrhythmias [^114nqY3A] [^111yYVBa].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

Large cohort studies show that hypothyroidism is associated with a **lower risk** of atrial fibrillation/flutter than euthyroid states [^111WkjB2] [^1158HG1p]. In a Danish registry of 586,460 adults, overt hypothyroidism had an incidence rate ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–0.92) and subclinical hypothyroidism 0.87 (95% CI 0.79–0.97) for atrial fibrillation/flutter versus euthyroid controls [^111WkjB2]. Similarly, the Framingham Heart Study found no increased AF risk with higher TSH or hypothyroidism [^1144fwLt].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hypothyroidism is characterized by **bradycardia**, reduced cardiac output, and increased systemic vascular resistance, which do not promote atrial flutter [^116w185N]. Atrial flutter requires a reentrant circuit driven by rapid atrial activity, typically facilitated by increased sympathetic tone, atrial stretch, or fibrosis — features more aligned with hyperthyroidism than hypothyroidism [^117H1FU9] [^117RRoRf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert statements do not list hypothyroidism as a cause of atrial flutter; instead, they emphasize **hyperthyroidism** as a recognized risk factor for atrial fibrillation/flutter and recommend screening and treatment to restore euthyroidism [^111PxcYM] [^113iPUXQ] [^117947hD]. Hypothyroidism is not highlighted as a causal factor for atrial flutter in these documents [^notfound].

---

## Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and atrial flutter

The clinically relevant concern is **excessive levothyroxine replacement** causing iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, which increases atrial flutter risk [^114nqY3A] [^116czisZ]. Overtreatment with levothyroxine can precipitate atrial arrhythmias, including flutter, particularly in older adults or those with underlying cardiac disease [^114nqY3A] [^111T8Bfg]. Therefore, TSH should be monitored regularly and dosing adjusted to maintain a normal range [^114nqY3A] [^111T8Bfg].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings regarding hypothyroidism and atrial flutter** |
|-|-|
| Large cohort studies | Lower risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter in hypothyroidism compared with euthyroidism [^111WkjB2] [^1158HG1p] |
| Clinical guidelines | Hypothyroidism not listed as a cause of atrial flutter; hyperthyroidism is recognized as a risk factor [^111PxcYM] [^113iPUXQ] |
| Clinical experience | Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism from levothyroxine overtreatment can precipitate atrial flutter [^114nqY3A] [^116czisZ] |

Hypothyroidism itself does not cause atrial flutter; rather, it is associated with a **lower risk** of atrial fibrillation/flutter than euthyroid states [^111WkjB2] [^1158HG1p]. The key clinical risk is **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism** from excessive levothyroxine, which can trigger atrial flutter; therefore, careful TSH monitoring and dose titration are essential to prevent arrhythmias [^114nqY3A] [^111T8Bfg].

### Thyroid function within the normal range, subclinical hypothyroidism, and the risk of atrial fibrillation [^116wk1Mh]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also associated with AF.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The association of TSH levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 levels and incident AF.

Results

Of 30085 participants from 11 cohorts (278955 person-years of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; P for trend ≤ 0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but not TSH levels, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^1173Zcp5]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to assess the association between the whole spectrum of thyroid disease and the subsequent risk of atrial fibrillation in a population of primary care patients. Our main finding was an apparent linear relation between levels of thyroid dysfunction and atrial fibrillation risk — that is, a low atrial fibrillation risk in hypothyroid patients, a high risk in hyperthyroidism, and a TSH level dependent (a dose-response relation) increased risk of atrial fibrillation in all levels of hyperthyroid disease, even in high normal euthyroid subjects. Notably, in subjects with reduced serum TSH levels but normal free thyroid hormone levels the risk of developing atrial fibrillation was increased approximately 10% in individuals with high normal thyroid function and increased about 40% in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism with suppressed TSH levels (table 4, fig 3). Overall, the relative risk of atrial fibrillation associated with thyroid dysfunction was highest among the younger subjects and lower in elderly subjects. This is because less of the atrial fibrillation risk is attributable to a hyperthyroid state in elderly people, whereas hyperthyroidism in younger adults is often the main cause of atrial fibrillation. This observation may be in line with the fact that the marked rise in atrial fibrillation incidence with increasing age is mainly due to increased cardiovascular comorbidity (such as hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and diabetes).

### Association of thyroid function genetic predictors with atrial fibrillation: a phenome-wide association study and inverse-variance weighted average meta-analysis [^115WiDQB]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Thyroid hormone levels are tightly regulated through feedback inhibition by thyrotropin, produced by the pituitary gland. Hyperthyroidism is overwhelmingly due to thyroid disorders and is well recognized to contribute to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular morbidity, particularly the increasingly common arrhythmia atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

To determine the association between genetically determined thyrotropin levels and AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phenome-wide association study scanned 1318 phenotypes associated with a polygenic predictor of thyrotropin levels identified by a previously published genome-wide association study that included participants of European ancestry. North American individuals of European ancestry with longitudinal electronic health records were analyzed from May 2008 to November 2016. Analysis began March 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical diagnoses associated with a polygenic predictor of thyrotropin levels.

Exposures

Genetically determined thyrotropin levels.

Results

Of 37 154 individuals, 19 330 (52%) were men. The thyrotropin polygenic predictor was positively associated with hypothyroidism (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07–1.14; P = 5×10–11) and inversely associated with diagnoses related to hyperthyroidism (OR,0.64; 95% CI, 0.54–0.74; P = 2×10–8 for toxic multinodular goiter). Among nonthyroid associations, the top association was AF/flutter (OR,0.93; 95% CI, 0.9–0.95; P = 9×10–7). When the analyses were repeated excluding 9801 individuals with any diagnoses of a thyroid-related disease, the AF association persisted (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.95; P = 2.9×10–6). To replicate this association, we conducted an inverse-variance weighted average meta-analysis using AF single-nucleotide variant weights from a genome-wide association study of 17 931 AF cases and 115 142 controls. As in the discovery analyses, each SD increase in predicted thyrotropin was associated with a decreased risk of AF (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.93; P = 4.7×10–4). In a set of AF cases (n = 745) and controls (n = 1680) older than 55 years, directly measured thyrotropin levels that fell within the normal range were inversely associated with AF risk (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99; P = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests a role for genetically determined variation in thyroid function within a physiologically accepted normal range as a risk factor for AF. The clinical decision to treat subclinical thyroid disease should incorporate the risk for AF as antithyroid medications to treat hyperthyroidism may reduce AF risk and thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism may increase AF risk.

### Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons: incidence, risk factors, and association with markers of HIV disease severity [^114ftkb2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of traditional risk factors and longitudinal measures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease severity with risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in a contemporary cohort of HIV-infected individuals.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is common in HIV-infected persons; however, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, AF, has not been adequately studied in this population.

Methods

We studied a national sample of 30,533 HIV-infected veterans followed in the Veterans Affairs HIV Clinical Case Registry from 1996 to 2011. We examined the independent associations of demographic characteristics, time-updated comorbidities, and time-updated clinical measurements including CD4(+) cell count and viral load with the outcome of incident AF using proportional hazards regression for multivariable analysis.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 780 (2.6%) patients developed AF. After multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors, a lower CD4(+) cell count (< 200 compared with > 350 cells/mm(3); hazard ratio [HR]: 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 1.8; p = 0.018) and higher viral load (> 100,000 compared with < 500 copies/ml; HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.4; p = 0.002) were independently associated with increased risk of incident AF. Additional risk factors independently associated with risk of AF included older age, White race, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, alcoholism, proteinuria, reduced kidney function, and hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

In a large HIV-infected cohort, markers of HIV disease severity represented by low CD4(+) cell count and high viral load, assessed by multiple time-updated measures, were independently associated with development of AF.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^116w185N]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and an important risk factor for ischaemic stroke and heart failure. Thyroid hormones have substantial effects on the cardiovascular system, and it is well known that overt hyperthyroidism is associated with atrial fibrillation. Subclinical hyperthyroidism (that is, reduced serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration but free thyroxine levels within reference ranges) is associated with elevated resting pulse, increased frequency of atrial and ventricular premature beats, increased left ventricular mass index, and cardiac output. Previous studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism have suggested increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation, but these studies were all performed in relatively small cohorts or using pooled data from several small cohorts. Also, because of the small sample sizes, it has been difficult to characterise subgroups of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism in order to assess a possible "dose dependent" association between serum TSH concentration and risk of atrial fibrillation, sex differences, and the possible role of high normal thyroid function (low TSH within the normal reference range). How subclinical hyperthyroidism should be managed has therefore also been much debated.

Overt hypothyroidism, however, is associated with bradycardia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, decreased variability in heart rate, and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Imaging studies of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (that is, with increased TSH, but free thyroxine within reference range) have shown subtle changes in cardiac performance. Despite these observations, neither overt nor subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with increased or decreased risk of atrial fibrillation.

The prevalence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is high in the adult population, and symptoms of thyroid disease are often mild — and, therefore, thyroid functions tests are often performed routinely in primary care on vague clinical indications. Furthermore, thyroid testing is typically included in many standard laboratory test packages. This policy makes available large population based databases with thyroid test results. Patients followed in primary care are often more healthy than hospital patients (inpatients and outpatients) and therefore provide a unique possibility to assess the isolated effect of thyroid dysfunction on the development of atrial fibrillation. The purpose of the present study was to assess the relation between thyroid function and risk of atrial fibrillation in a large cohort of primary care patients.

### Relation of hypothyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation (from the framingham heart study) [^1144fwLt]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperthyroidism has a well-described association with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the relation of hypothyroidism to AF has had limited investigation. Hypothyroidism is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical cardiovascular disease, and overt cardiovascular disease, all of which predispose to AF. We investigated 10-year incidence of AF in a community-dwelling cohort.

Methods

Among 6,653 Framingham heart Study participants, 5,069 participants, 52% female, with mean age of 57 ± 12 years, were eligible after excluding those with missing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), TSH < 0.45 μU/L (hyperthyroid), TSH > 19.9 μU/L, or prevalent AF. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was categorized by range (≥ 0.45 to < 4.5, 4.5 to < 10.0, 10.0 to ≤ 19.9 μU/L) and by quartiles. We examined the associations between TSH and 10-year risk of AF using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis.

Results

Over 10-year follow-up, we observed 277 cases of incident AF. A 1-SD increase in TSH was not associated with increased risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.90–1.14, P = 0.83). In categorical analysis, using TSH ≥ 0.45 to < 4.5 μU/L as the referent (equivalent to euthyroid state), we found no significant association between hypothyroidism and 10-year AF risk. Comparing the highest (2.6 < TSH < 19.9 μU/L) to lowest (0.45 < TSH < 1.3 μU/L) quartiles of TSH further did not identify a significant association between TSH levels and 10-year risk of AF.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we did not identify a significant association between hypothyroidism and 10-year risk of incident AF in a community-based study.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^113w9Rk4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is well known that thyroid hormonal abnormalities, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, are intimately associated with cardiovascular disorders. Thyroid hormone has ubiquitous effects on the major components of the circulatory system, such as the heart and the blood vessels, and modulates every component of the cardiovascular organs. Therefore, when cardiovascular disease is present, clinicians usually determine whether thyroid disorders are concomitantly present in individuals. In particular, hyperthyroidism, either overt or subclinical, is known to carry a risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), often inducing heart failure. 1, 2, 3

The role of hypothyroidism in atrial arrhythmogenesis, however, is less recognized and is not fully understood. 2 Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a state with elevated serum thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with thyroid hormone levels within the reference range, and the thyroid dysfunction is compensated for by the greater stimulation of the elevated TSH level and also increases the risk of cardiovascular events. 4 Clinically, a close association of hypothyroidism history with the occurrence of AF was suggested in patients enrolled for > 10 years. 5 In an animal study, it was demonstrated that hypothyroidism leads to an increase in AF vulnerability. 6

Catheter ablation for AF, a common treatment to prevent recurrent AF or convert persistent AF to sinus rhythm, is primarily achieved through isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs), which generally function as sources of AF by triggering premature contractions. Given the demonstrated association of AF occurrence with hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism may also unfavorably affect the outcome of catheter ablation for AF. In this regard, however, few data have been available. This study was designed to elucidate the association of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and high‐normal TSH levels with atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after PV isolation (PVI)–based radiofrequency catheter ablation for AF.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^115ptVHW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Part of the results seen in prospective cohort studies could be explained by the fact that TSH levels even within the normal reference range predict future hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. However, our results and those of recent studiessupport the hypothesis that even subclinical hyperthyroidism and high normal euthyroid states increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. These results add to the ongoing discussion of whether the lower reference range of plasma TSH levels should be reconsidered.

To our knowledge we are the first to demonstrate a protective effect of hypothyroidism towards atrial fibrillation. None of the above mentioned studieswere able to show such a relationship. Elevated TSH levels have previously been associated with increased longevity in both animal modelsand human studies, and an intriguing possibility is that the lower resting heart rate associated with hypothyroidism not only protects against atrial fibrillation but could also lower cardiovascular mortality.

Most of the patients in this cohort from primary care will be treated, as appropriate, with radioiodine, antithyroid medication, or thyroid replacement therapy according to established clinical practice. Antithyroid treatment reverses the acute risk of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism, and our results therefore suggest that much of the pathophysiological background for atrial fibrillation risk in the study was established in the period preceding thyroid screening — that is, a long term affection of the heart caused by the subclinical thyroid dysfunction. The results from the sensitivity analysis support this notion as the subjects with overt hyperthyroidism had a markedly increased risk of atrial fibrillation the first six months, which then fell to a level similar to the risk found in the main analysis. Interestingly, the risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroidism was significantly increased after 12 months. This further underlines the importance of early detection and treatment of subclinical thyroid disease to avoid development of irreversible cardiovascular abnormalities as well as psychiatric and cognitive sequelae.

Our results support the growing evidence that subclinical hyperthyroid and possibly also high normal euthyroid states are risk factors for atrial fibrillation and suggest that patients with these conditions should routinely be screened for atrial fibrillation. Whether more aggressive thyroid screening and treatment can reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation and its complications require further study.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111XWhDB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has been shown to contribute to enhanced atrial arrhythmogenesis, resulting in atrial fibrillation (AF) development in animal models and clinical populations. We aimed to elucidate whether high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are related to outcomes of catheter ablation of AF.

Methods and Results

Of 477 consecutive patients who underwent first-time pulmonary vein isolation-based radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF, 456 with TSH above the lower limit of the normal range (age, 65.5 ± 9.9 years; men, 73.9%; paroxysmal AF, 56.8%) were analyzed for this study. Atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence for 3 years was compared across groups with hypothyroidism (n = 23) and TSH quartile groups with euthyroidism (normal-range TSH levels, n = 433). Atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence occurred in 179 patients (39%) after the first session. Patients with hypothyroidism had increased recurrence compared with patients with normal TSH levels (crude hazard ratio, 3.14 after the last session; P = 0.001). When focusing on patients with normal TSH levels, recurrence-free survivals after both the first and last sessions were significantly reduced in euthyroid patients with the highest quartile of TSH levels (quartile 4) compared with others (quartiles 1–3). Cox regression analysis identified high TSH levels as an independent predictor of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after both the first (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.51; P = 0.018) and last (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.86; P = 0.023) sessions. The difference was more pronounced in patients with paroxysmal AF than in those with nonparoxysmal AF.

Conclusions

Not only hypothyroidism but also high-normal TSH levels may be an independent predictor of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of AF.

### A deeper understanding of the causal relationships between thyroid function and atrial fibrillation [^114jB992]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

This should be taken into account when weighing potential benefits and drawbacks of treating subclinical variations in thyroid function. Since well-powered randomized controlled trials will require a long follow-up period and a large group of participants to detect the effects of minor variations in thyroid function on long-term complications such as AF risk, the data on causality derived from MR studies are likely to be the only relevant data available in the near future. For the height-independent part of the effects of thyroid function on AF, future studies should clarify whether a certain deviation in thyroid function due to inherited genetic variants (lifetime exposure) has the same effect on AF risk as a similar nongenetically determined (more sudden) shift in thyroid function.

In conclusion, the study by Shi et al. illustrates how a high-quality MR study followed by comprehensive sensitivity analyses and an in-depth critical analysis of findings can be a valuable and effective tool that not only allows to assess causality, but also improves our understanding of underlying modifiable and nonmodifiable pathways, with potential clinical implications. Given the pleiotropic nature of many other hormones, similar robust approaches should also be used in other endocrine fields.

### Effects of thyroid dysfunction and the thyroid-stimulating hormone levels on the risk of atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis from cohort studies [^116kDy5S]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the relationship between thyroid dysfunction, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, and risks of atrial fibrillation (AF) in studies and conduct a dose-response meta-analysis on the correlation between the TSH levels and risk of AF.

Methods

Thirteen studies from 5 databases with 649293 subjects (mean age, 65.1 years) were included. The dose-response meta-analysis was conducted by comparing the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident AF associated with different levels of TSH (vs TSH level of 0 mU/L) across studies. Data were collected until October 25, 2021.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and clinical hyperthyroidism were associated with an increased risk of AF (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11–2.62; RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05–1.44; and RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.07–5.16, respectively), whereas clinical hypothyroidism was not associated with the significantly increased risk of AF (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.72–1.99). A nonlinear relationship was observed in 2 models (crude model, P nonlinear < .001; adjusted model, P nonlinear = .0391) between the TSH levels and risks of AF.

Conclusions

Our study indicated that subclinical hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, clinical hyperthyroidism were associated with the risk of AF, and the results for the TSH levels and risk of AF were mixed, which showed a U-shaped relationship.

Discussion

The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to examine the long‐term outcome of catheter ablation of AF on hypothyroidism and TSH levels. The major findings of our study were as follows: (1) the patients diagnosed with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism had a significantly higher prevalence of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence than those with normal TSH after ablation procedures; (2) patients with a high‐normal TSH level (quartile 4) within the normal TSH range had a significantly higher prevalence of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence than the lower‐TSH quartiles (quartile 1–3); and (3) this trend was more pronounced in the subgroup of paroxysmal AF than in nonparoxysmal AF. Taken together, these findings indicate that patients with a successful AF catheter ablation procedure could be exposed greater to a risk of AF recurrence if their TSH level was even on the high end of the normal range, even more so if they had subclinical or overt hypothyroidism.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism and AF Prevalence: Cohort Studies

Subclinical hypothyroidism with a TSH level above the normal range, as well as overt hypothyroidism, may represent a novel cardiac risk factor. 8 With respect to AF, previous studies have failed to show a significant association of subclinical hypothyroidism. There was no significant association between TSH > 10 mIU/L and a 10‐year risk of incident AF in a community‐based study. 9 A recent systemic review including > 30 000 participants showed that, among euthyroid individuals, only a higher circulating free thyroxine level is associated with increased risk of incident AF. 10 The results do not seem to support our findings. However, the disagreement may be explained by the difference in study population. The large cohort studies targeted patients who had not had AF at the time of inclusion, 9, 10 whereas we studied patients already having AF.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^1158HG1p]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To examine the risk of atrial fibrillation in relation to the whole spectrum of thyroid function in a large cohort of patients.

Design Population based cohort study of general practice patients identified by linkage of nationwide registries at the individual level.

Setting Primary care patients in the city of Copenhagen.

Subjects Registry data for 586 460 adults who had their thyroid function evaluated for the first time by their general practitioner during 2000–10 and who were without previously recorded thyroid disease or atrial fibrillation.

Main outcome measure Poisson regression models used to estimate risk of atrial fibrillation by thyroid function.

Results Of the 586 460 individuals in the study population (mean (SD) age 50.2 (16.9) years, 39% men), 562 461 (96.0%) were euthyroid, 1670 (0.3%) had overt hypothyroidism, 12 087 (2.0%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 3966 (0.7%) had overt hyperthyroidism, and 6276 (1.0%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. Compared with the euthyroid individuals, the risk of atrial fibrillation increased with decreasing levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from high normal euthyroidism (incidence rate ratio 1.12 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.21)) to subclinical hyperthyroidism with reduced TSH (1.16 (0.99 to 1.36)) and subclinical hyperthyroidism with supressed TSH (1.41 (1.25 to 1.59)). Both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism were associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation.

Conclusion The risk of atrial fibrillation was closely associated with thyroid activity, with a low risk in overt hypothyroidism, high risk in hyperthyroidism, and a TSH level dependent association with risk of atrial fibrillation across the spectrum of subclinical thyroid disease.

### Assessment of the relationship between genetic determinants of thyroid function and atrial fibrillation… [^1116qf8T]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Low thyrotropin, as an early sign of an overactive thyroid gland, with a concomitant increased FT3: FT4 ratio are genetically associated with AF. Importance Increased free thyroxine and decreased thyrotropin are associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation in observational studies, but direct involvement is unclear. Conclusions and Relevance Genetically increased FT3: FT4 ratio and hyperthyroidism, but not FT4 within the reference range, were associated with increased AF, and increased thyrotropin within the reference range and hypothyroidism were associated with decreased AF, supporting a pathway involving the pituitary-thyroid-cardiac axis. In observational longitudinal studies, increased free thyroxine within the reference range, 1 subclinical hyperthyroidism, 2, 3 and overt primary hyperthyroidism2, 4 are associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, whereas overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with reduced risk of AF.

2 Risk of AF is highest at the time of diagnosis of hyperthyroidism but risk persists despite antithyroid treatment. 4–7 This raises the question of whether FT4 is on the causal pathway or instead a biomarker for the hyperthyroid-AF association. The FT4 SNPs derive from associations among individuals with FT4 levels within the reference range and no evidence of thyroid disease. 10–12 Further, when these SNPs were combined into a genetic risk score, they were not associated with thyroid disease in the forms of Graves disease, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism. 12 By contrast, the instruments for thyrotropin within the reference range were associated with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. 12 These distinctions may emphasize a diseased thyroid state rather than normal variation in thyroid function as driving the instrumental associations with AF.

Such an interpretation is consistent with variability in observational associations between thyrotropin and AF, where the proportion of individuals with subclinical or overt thyroid disease may not have been adequately controlled. 2 Notably, the MR results for thyrotropin in this report are consistent with a large Danish observational study finding that hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were associated with increased and decreased risk of AF, respectively, and that there was an inverse linear association between thyrotropin and risk of AF in a sample that included individuals with thyrotropin outside of the normal range. 2.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^113HQym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperthyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyperthyroidism include increased synthesis of thyroid hormones (e.g. Grave's disease), release of preformed thyroid hormones due to destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g., thyroiditis), and exogenous thyroid hormone intake.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 13,000 per 100,000 population. In Europe, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 800 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Hyperthyroidism leads to a higher incidence of AF and atrial flutter, and, at least partly by that mechanism, a higher risk of cerebral arterial thrombosis. Hyperthyroidism additionally leads to increased bone turnover and a negative bone balance.

### Hyperthyroidism and risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter… [^114BNMVp]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Results Among 40 628 patients diagnosed as having hyperthyroidism, 3362 were diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation or flutter within ± 30 days from the date of the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. It is well recognized that hyperthyroidism is associated with risk of worsening of a preexisting heart disease, but hyperthyroidism can also, by itself, cause cardiac disease. 8, 9 Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac manifestation in hyperthyroidism, and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation has been reported to. Patients were followed up in the Danish National Registry of Patients and in the Central Person Registry.

A diagnosis of atrial fibrillation that occurred in the Danish National Registry of Patients ± 30 days from the date of diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was considered as the association of interest. The short interval of 30 days was chosen to increase the probability of a causal association between hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation or flutter. The risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter in hyperthyroidism was higher in men than in women, and the risk of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism increased by increasing age during the age range of 20 to 89 years. The presence of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and heart valve disease was also associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

In patients with preexisting heart disease, the increased workload caused by the induction of a hyperdynamic circulation caused by hyperthyroidism may further impair heart function, leading to heart failure, angina, and atrial fibrillation. Conversely, tachyarrhythmia caused by a combination of hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation may also lead to heart failure due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. However, from evaluation of case records of patients participating in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study25 and recorded in the Danish National Registry of Patients with an incident diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or flutter, we know that approximately 5% of the recorded cases have pure atrial flutter. If hyperthyroidism is not associated with risk of atrial flutter, inclusion of atrial flutter in the present study may have biased the risk estimates. However, given the low proportion of patients with atrial flutter, this bias would be modest.

### A deeper understanding of the causal relationships between thyroid function and atrial fibrillation [^117BNhmE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones are highly pleiotropic and even minor variations in thyroid function have been associated with various adverse clinical outcomes in observational studies. This has opened up discussions whether mild (subclinical) thyroid dysfunction should be treated and whether reference ranges for thyroid function tests should be adapted. However, observational studies are prone to various sources of bias, including residual confounding, reverse causality, and selection bias, which can affect their results and disrupt their interpretation. It is therefore key to first assess whether the reported associations are causal or not. While most of the reported associations have not been verified by randomized controlled trials or experimental studies, Mendelian randomization (MR) is a well-established and widely used method to investigate causality. Its fundamental principle is that genetic variants which alter an exposure that is causal for the outcome of interest should also be associated with this outcome to the extent corresponding to their effects on the exposure. In this way, genetic variants are used as proxies to evaluate the causal effect of an exposure (eg, thyroid function) on the outcome of interest. They draw from the fact that genetic variants segregate randomly from parents to offspring, which can be compared with the randomization applied in clinical trials and allows potential confounding to be overcome. However, this approach requires several assumptions: the genetic variants used as instruments in MR analyses have to be associated with the exposure, they have to be independent of confounders of the exposure–outcome relationship, and their effects on the outcome of interest have to be mediated solely by the exposure under study. Consequently, any so-called horizontal pleiotropic variants should be excluded as they can bias the results of a MR analysis.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^1163d9ig]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To examine the risk of atrial fibrillation in relation to the whole spectrum of thyroid function in a large cohort of patients.

Design

Population based cohort study of general practice patients identified by linkage of nationwide registries at the individual level.

Setting

Primary care patients in the city of Copenhagen.

Subjects

Registry data for 586,460 adults who had their thyroid function evaluated for the first time by their general practitioner during 2000–10 and who were without previously recorded thyroid disease or atrial fibrillation.

Main Outcome Measure

Poisson regression models used to estimate risk of atrial fibrillation by thyroid function.

Results

Of the 586,460 individuals in the study population (mean (SD) age 50.2 (16.9) years, 39% men), 562,461 (96.0%) were euthyroid, 1670 (0.3%) had overt hypothyroidism, 12,087 (2.0%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 3966 (0.7%) had overt hyperthyroidism, and 6276 (1.0%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. Compared with the euthyroid individuals, the risk of atrial fibrillation increased with decreasing levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from high normal euthyroidism (incidence rate ratio 1.12 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.21)) to subclinical hyperthyroidism with reduced TSH (1.16 (0.99 to 1.36)) and subclinical hyperthyroidism with supressed TSH (1.41 (1.25 to 1.59)). Both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism were associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation.

Conclusion

The risk of atrial fibrillation was closely associated with thyroid activity, with a low risk in overt hypothyroidism, high risk in hyperthyroidism, and a TSH level dependent association with risk of atrial fibrillation across the spectrum of subclinical thyroid disease.

### Association between amiodarone and thyrotoxicosis in patients with atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism [^114UTXdc]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence remains scarce on the risk of transition from hypothyroidism to thyrotoxicosis in patients treated with amiodarone.

Objective

we aimed to assess the association between amiodarone and thyrotoxicosis in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Methods

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study utilizing the Clalit Health Services database, the largest healthcare provider in Israel. Patients with new diagnosis of AF between 2010 and 2023 were used to identify two separate cohorts defined based on their thyroid function status (hypothyroidism cohort vs. normal thyroid cohort). Using Cox proportional hazard regression, exposure to amiodarone was examined as a time-dependent variable, allowing subjects to transfer from one exposure group to another during follow-up.

Results

A total of 23,854 AF patients were included in the hypothyroidism cohort with thyrotoxicosis diagnosed during follow-up in 107 patients (66 of 8,212 amiodarone users and 41 of 15,622 non-users), reflecting a crude incidence rate of 3.43 and 0.63 per 1000 person-years in amiodarone users and non-users, respectively. In this cohort, amiodarone was independently associated with increased risk of thyrotoxicosis with an adjusted-HR of 5.18 (95% CI, 3.48–7.69). The magnitude of amiodarone effect was higher in patients with normal thyroid function with an incidence rate of 19.78 and 1.14 per 1000 person-years in amiodarone users and non-users, respectively, and an adjusted-HR of 15.02 (95% CI, 13.56–16.64).

Conclusion

While the magnitude of the effect of amiodarone on the risk of thyrotoxicosis is lower in patients with hypothyroidism, the risk remains elevated and mandates caution.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115nWDUG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Role of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in AF Development

In addition, evidence has emerged that subclinical hypothyroidism may be a risk factor for developing AF. Sairaku et al demonstrated that LA a‐ and v‐wave pressure and mean LA pressure were significantly higher in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 4.5 mIU/L; mean, 5.99 mIU/L) than in those with euthyroidism. 11 Park et al have reported a higher incidence of transient AF in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as TSH > 4.1 mIU/L, after coronary artery bypass graft. 12 These facts strongly indicate that even subclinical hypothyroidism induces deteriorating myocardium or vascular resistance, probably resulting in increasing atrial pressure and AF occurrence. Organ damage, such as dilated LA cavity and reduced creatinine clearance, was more frequent in the highest quartile of the normal TSH or hypothyroidism groups. Such remodeled and degenerated tissues and cardiac and renal dysfunction might be easily acceptable for atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation. Our population with relatively high TSH levels within the reference range showed a greater preponderance of elderly women, similar to that previously reported on a subclinical hypothyroidism population, 13 suggesting that quartile 4 is pathologically close to subclinical hypothyroidism.

Important basic research was reported by Zhang et al. 6 They performed an electrophysiological study using a rat model and demonstrated that hypothyroidism resulted in an increased AF susceptibility. In addition, they found that the hypothyroid rats showed a significantly longer atrial effective refractory period and increased LA interstitial fibrosis than euthyroid rats. Atrial fibrosis can lead to slow conduction and increased conduction heterogeneity, thus favoring reentry formation and increasing AF vulnerability. 14 The development of atrial fibrosis is a hallmark of structural remodeling in AF and is considered a substrate for AF perpetuation. In fact, several studies have linked more extensive atrial interstitial fibrosis to lower effectiveness of AF catheter ablation. 14 Thus, it may be reasonable to assume that the high incidence of arrhythmia recurrence observed in the highest TSH euthyroid quartile is at least partly attributable to increased atrial fibrosis. Although free thyroxine levels did not significantly differ between quartile 4 and quartile 1 to 3, changes in serum TSH levels are better than triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels to assess thyroid function because TSH levels sensitively reflect the negative feedback of thyroid status. 4

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction affects the heart… [^112FiKrD]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical thyroid dysfunction has well-recognized effects on the heart. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction, with abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone and normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels, also is associated with cardiac changes. Biondi and associates reviewed clinical studies of the effect of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the heart. Normalization of TSH levels with thyroid hormone supplementation can improve systolic function, possibly as a result of improved myocardial contractility. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism may have a higher risk for coronary artery disease, which could be caused by lipid abnormalities or other problems with vascular reactivity. Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be caused exogenously by the overzealous use of L-thyroxine to suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid nodular disease or prevent thyroid cancer progression after surgery, or endogenously by Graves' disease, multinodular goiter, or a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule.

Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism lowers the pre-ejection period and the ventricular contraction time. Often, left ventricular mass also is enhanced, and an increase in atrial premature beats and atrial fibrillation is noted, with no increase in ventricular arrhythmias. Beta blockade seems to eliminate these changes. Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism appears to cause an increase in heart rate and a rise in left ventricular mass. Treatment with thyroid suppression reverses these changes. The effect of these changes on left ventricular function is less clear, making the significance of the increased left ventricular mass difficult to determine. There appears to be an increased risk of death from cardiac causes among persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism, but the exact cause is unknown. The authors conclude that minimal changes in thyroid hormone levels can cause changes in the heart.

Among elderly persons, subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, while subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased mortality from all causes, but especially from cardiac disease. The cut-off point for the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism requiring treatment should probably be a TSH level above 4 μU per mL rather than 10 μU per mL, especially if thyroid antibodies are present. |When the appropriate replacement dose is achieved, obtain follow-up TSH determinations every six to 12 months. |.

### Thyroid status, cardiovascular risk, and mortality in older adults [^1157D6oW]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Previous studies have suggested that subclinical abnormalities in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are associated with detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system.

Objective

To determine the relationship between baseline thyroid status and incident atrial fibrillation, incident cardiovascular disease, and mortality in older men and women not taking thyroid medication.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 3233 US community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older with baseline serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were enrolled in 1989–1990 in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a large, prospective cohort study.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death assessed through June 2002. Analyses are reported for 4 groups defined according to thyroid function test results: subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and overt hypothyroidism.

Results

Individuals with overt thyrotoxicosis (n = 4) were excluded because of small numbers. Eighty-two percent of participants (n = 2639) had normal thyroid function, 15% (n = 496) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 1.6% (n = 51) had overt hypothyroidism, and 1.5% (n = 47) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. After exclusion of those with prevalent atrial fibrillation, individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation compared with those with normal thyroid function (67 events vs 31 events per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.03). No differences were seen between the subclinical hyperthyroidism group and euthyroidism group for incident coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, or all-cause death. Likewise, there were no differences between the subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism groups and the euthyroidism group for cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. Specifically, individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.28) for incident coronary heart disease.

Conclusion

Our data show an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and development of atrial fibrillation but do not support the hypothesis that unrecognized subclinical hyperthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with other cardiovascular disorders or mortality.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^114t4BJh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The eight year cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation among our elderly subjects (> 65 years old) was approximately 13% in those with overt hyperthyroidism and slightly lower in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism (fig 2). This is more than 10% lower than previously reported by Sawin et aland 25% lower than reported by Cappola et al: it might be explained by increased focus on thyroid disease and cardiovascular risk in primary care, or the fact that these studies did not account for the effect of competing risk of death. Also, these previous studies showed no relationship between hypothyroidism and atrial fibrillation. Notably, we found a reduction in the cumulative incidence and overall risk of atrial fibrillation among hypothyroid subjects. One explanation for this finding may be that we studied a cohort with little comorbidity and, therefore, might observe a more direct physiological effect of the hypothyroid state. Another possibility is that hypothyroid patients are treated with levothyroxine, which is known to somewhat reverse cardiovascular risk factors (for example, thyromimetic drugs may decrease levels of atherogenic lipoproteins). Interestingly, the sensitivity analysis of overt hypothyroid patients showed a stable risk of atrial fibrillation during the first 12 months, whereas the subclinical hypothyroid subjects had no reduced risk of atrial fibrillation after 12 months. In the sensitivity analysis we assumed that most patients would be well treated during the first 12 months, and our results, although not significant, indicated that the level of hypothyroidism was inversely correlated to the risk of atrial fibrillation and that treatment normalised this relationship.

A previous cross sectional study including 5860 subjectsshowed a relation between electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation and concentrations of free thyroxine (but not TSH levels) even in euthyroid subjects, suggesting that high normal thyroid function is indeed a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, as we found in the current study. A recent prospective cohort study by Heeringa et al of 1426 subjects showed that in euthyroid subjects there was a relation between risk of atrial fibrillation and levels of TSH and free thyroxine. A recent study by Collet et al, based on 10 prospective cohorts and a total of 52 674 pooled participants, found an overall 68% increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid patients and a 150% increased risk in those with TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L. However, the latter finding was based on only four events; in comparison, we had 280 events in the same group and found only a 40% increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

### Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism and long-term risks of incident atrial fibrillation and flutter [^114gpiAA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Although iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is a potential consequence of iodinated radiologic contrast administration, its association with long-term cardiovascular outcomes has not been previously studied.

Objective

To investigate the relationships between hyperthyroidism observed after iodine contrast administration and incident atrial fibrillation/flutter.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (1998–2021) of patients age ≥ 18 years with a normal baseline serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration, subsequent TSH < 1 year, and receipt of iodine contrast < 60 days before the subsequent TSH. Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to ascertain the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI of incident atrial fibrillation/flutter following iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, compared with iodine-induced euthyroidism.

Results

Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism was observed in 2500 (5.6%) of 44 607 Veterans (mean ± SD age, 60.9 ± 14.1 years; 88% men) and atrial fibrillation/flutter in 10.4% over a median follow-up of 3.7 years (interquartile range 1.9–7.4). Adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter compared with those who remained euthyroid after iodine exposure (adjusted HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06–1.33). Females were at greater risk for incident atrial fibrillation/flutter than males (females, HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.12–2.92; males, HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03–1.30; P for interaction = .04).

Conclusion

Hyperthyroidism following a high iodine load was associated with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation/flutter, particularly among females. The observed sex-based differences should be confirmed in a more sex-diverse study sample, and the cost-benefit analysis of long-term monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias following iodine-induced hyperthyroidism should be evaluated.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^1144mHmP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, with a worldwide prevalence of 59.7 million cases. The lifetime risk of developing AF in Europe and the United States is 25% for those over the age of 55. Overt hyperthyroidism is an established risk factor for AF with a relative risk of 6.0. Treatment of hyperthyroidism prevents the onset of AF (RRR = 31%) and is associated with the resolution of AF (RRR = 80%).

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH), defined as a low TSH with normal free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3), has also been associated with AF in several studies. The prevalence of SH ranges between 1% and 10% worldwide and is highest in iodine‐deficient countries. The mean incidence of AF in those with SH is 1.87%/year. SH is associated with increased P wave duration on electrocardiography (ECG), as well as increased ascending aorta and end‐diastolic ventricular diameters on echocardiogram. P‐wave duration and end‐diastolic left ventricular diameter are also associated with AF.

Very few studies have assessed the effect of treating SH on AF, with the available studies predominantly investigating the role of treating SH in AF resolution as well as in improving ECG and echocardiographic features associated with SH. The objective of our study was to identify whether an association exists between treatment of SH in outpatients and preventing incident AF.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1161DWXM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Future Directions

Because these results suggest a relationship between high TSH levels and atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence, we may well expect the possibility of recurrence in patients after catheter ablation in consideration of TSH levels. It is feasible that a higher level of TSH can be ameliorated by exogenous thyroid hormones. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated with thyroid hormones because administration of exogenous thyroid hormones can easily produce iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism with AF. 17 Also, previous studies have provided no clear evidence that additional thyroid hormone therapy in subjects with milder forms of subclinical hypothyroidism could improve lipid status and other cardiovascular risk factors, 18 as well as symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. 19 Alternatively, because hypothyroidism enhances atrial fibrosis, leading to increased AF substrate, 6 adjunctive ablation strategies, such as ablation targeting low‐voltage areas, 14, 20 may improve the atrial tachyarrhythmia–free survival in this subset of the patients.

Study Limitations

There are some limitations to this study. First, given the relatively small size of the population, a larger study would allow us to identify the TSH levels worthy of appropriate caution. A cutoff level of TSH for differentiating atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after ablation was not available because of the small number of patients. Second, this study was a retrospective assessment, although the registration and systematic follow‐up for catheter ablation in our hospital was the essential basis for study analysis. Third, the thyroid functions were evaluated once just before the catheter ablation procedure because the prognostic information should be of the greatest importance at this point. However, serial measurements may have provided more clinically relevant information to discuss the relationship between ablation outcome and thyroid status, such as the duration of hypothyroid or high‐normal TSH state. Finally, although the causal effect of atrial fibrosis on AF recurrence is one hypothesis to explain the worse outcome seen in patients with hypothyroidism or high‐normal TSH levels, the atrial fibrosis was not evaluated in the present study.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / European association of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation (EACPR) position paper on how to prevent atrial fibrillation endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) [^113iPUXQ]. Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and endocrine factors — atrial fibrillation (AF) risk and prevention are outlined as follows: Hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus are commonly associated with risk of developing AF, whereas hypothyroidism poses no or reduces risk for arrhythmia. Observational cohort and registry studies reported AF incidence rates of 4.6–13.8% in overt hyperthyroidism, 8.5–12.7% in subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 7.3% in high-normal euthyroidism (based on thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] levels). In subclinical disease, patients are up to 1.68-fold more likely to develop AF during long-term follow-up, and those with suppressed TSH values have 2.54-fold higher risk of incident AF compared with euthyroid populations. AF risk diminishes during antithyroid treatment, with spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm in ~76% of patients and with higher restoration rates in elderly patients with overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism who lack cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. The Rotterdam study reported increased AF risk in individuals with high-normal thyroid function (based on TSH level) and in subjects < 65 years old with higher free thyroxine levels within normal range. In the subclinical form, age and sex affect incident AF risk, being significant in all age categories in women and in young male individuals, except in the older (> 65 years) male population; a meta-analysis also found association with male sex but not with the presence of cardiovascular disease or its risk factors. Subclinical hyperthyroidism was shown to be a predictor of AF in elderly individuals along with advanced age category (> 75 years), male sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart failure. Recent studies indicate that thyroid disease is not an independent predictor of AF-related complications such as thromboembolism and stroke. Prevention of AF in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism should include measures such as controlling thyroid function, treatment of associated cardiovascular diseases, and modification of risk factors.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1172ceYg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We studied whether TSH levels are related to 3‐year outcomes of catheter ablation of AF. A high TSH level, even a high‐normal level, is an independent predictor of long‐term atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence. Therefore, TSH levels should be noted in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, especially paroxysmal AF.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^111WkjB2]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Poisson regression analysis

Overall, an almost linear relation was seen between thyroid function and risk of atrial fibrillation (table 3) — that is, from a decreased risk in overt hypothyroidism (incidence rate ratio 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.92)) and subclinical hypothyroidism (0.87 (0.79 to 0.97)) to an increased risk in subclinical hyperthyroidism (1.31 (1.19 to 1.44)) and overt hyperthyroidism (1.42 (1.22 to 1.63)) compared with the euthyroid state. This relation was observed in all examined subgroups except from the group of men aged > 65 years with overt hyperthyroidism. The highest relative risk of atrial fibrillation was seen among young men with overt hyperthyroidism and young women with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

A similar almost linear relation was seen between mild hyperthyroid states based on TSH level (high normal euthyroid to subclinical hyperthyroid) and risk of atrial fibrillation (table 4, fig 3).

Supplementary sensitivity analysis

The results from the sensitivity analyses are presented in appendix B on bmj.com. When including any treatment as a time dependent variable, we found a slight reduction in risk of atrial fibrillation in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism, whereas the results for the hypothyroid states showed a slight accentuation of the risk reducing effect. Including methimazole and levothyroxine as time dependent variables also gave a slight risk reduction among the hyperthyroid patients, but it did not change the results significantly for the hypothyroid patients. The stratified sensitivity analysis at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up showed that overt hypothyroid patients had no difference in the risk for the three periods. The subclinical hypothyroid patients were normalised after 12 months. In overt hyperthyroid patients the risk of atrial fibrillation was markedly elevated in the first six months and then fell to a level comparable with that of the main model. The subclinical hyperthyroid patients showed a drop in risk of atrial fibrillation after six months and then an elevated risk after 12 months of follow-up.

Adjusting the main model for known risk factors of atrial fibrillation such as hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and diabetes did not alter the main results. Including thyroid status as a time dependent variable accentuated the risk estimates for the hyperthyroid states, and showed the same trend for overt hypothyroid subjects, whereas the results for the subclinical hypothyroid group became non-significant. Using the five year Charlson comorbidity index in the analysis did not alter the results.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114JxcxR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Dysthyroidism might be iatrogenic as a result of prescribing amiodarone in some patients. Treatment with amiodarone was more frequent in the hypothyroidism and high‐normal TSH groups compared with their corresponding groups. It may be possible that patients treated with amiodarone had a tendency toward increased atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence because of iatrogenic high TSH levels. One may argue that the amiodarone use can be a marker of increased resistance to the AF treatment. However, multivariate analysis did not identify amiodarone use as a significant variable related to the risk of the recurrence.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure because the original data included the patients' personal information.

Study Population

From January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2015, 477 consecutive patients who underwent first‐time radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF or persistent AF, including long‐standing AF (nonparoxysmal AF), were enrolled at our institute. We evaluated thyroid hormone function by measuring the levels of TSH, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine. First, patients with TSH levels below the reference range (hyperthyroidism) were excluded from analysis. Second, patients diagnosed clinically with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism were compared with the remaining patients having TSH levels within the reference range, indicating normal thyroid function ("euthyroidism"). Third, patients with euthyroidism were divided into quartiles according to TSH levels, regardless of free triiodothyronine or thyroxine levels, history of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, or medications for hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and arrhythmia, and were analyzed. The levels of TSH, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine were also determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay within a week before the ablation. The reference ranges for TSH, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine were 0.4 to 4.2 mIU/mL, 2.3 to 4.1 pg/mL, and 0.88 to 1.50 ng/dL, respectively.

We evaluated the risk scores for predicting ischemic stroke in clinical practice by using the CHADS2 score (scored as 1 point each for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ?75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for past stroke or transient ischemic attack)?on hospital admission. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants was initially introduced for all patients at least 3 weeks before the ablation procedure, as recommended by the expert consensus statement. 7

### How useful is thyroid function testing in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation? [^111u3Yr3]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

Background: Patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation often undergo routine thyroid function screening to rule out thyroid disease as a cause of atrial fibrillation. Methods: Patients with recent onset of documented atrial fibrillation or flutter were enrolled in the Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation from outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and hospital wards across Canada. Seven hundred twenty-six patients underwent baseline thyroid function screening and were assessed for presence of clinical thyroid disease. Serum thyrotropin level was measured in 707 patients, and thyroxine level in 407 patients. Results: A TSH level less than 0. 1 mU/L was present in 5 patients. A TSH level less than normal but more than 0. 1 mU/L was present in 34 patients. No patient had definite hypothyroidism, but 56 patients had an elevated TSH level that was less than 20 mU/L. During 1.

7 years of follow-up, only 7 patients were found to have clinical hyperthyroidism, and 11 patients had hypothyroidism. Logistic regression analysis showed that palpitations and asymptomatic presentation were risk factors for low TSH level, and increasing age was a risk factor for high TSH level. The positive predictive value of palpitations and asymptomatic presentation for low TSH level were 9% and 8%, respectively. Conclusions: An abnormal TSH level is common in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation. However, clinical thyroid disease is uncommon. Routine TSH screening of patients who have atrial fibrillation has a low yield and may be better applied to those patients at higher risk of having undiagnosed clinical thyroid disease.

### Multi-trait analysis characterizes the genetics of thyroid function and identifies causal associations with clinical implications [^115CLUAL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Pleiotropic effects of thyroid function parameters on clinical endpoints

In the phenome-wide association study using polygenic scores (PGS), associations were found between reference range TSH-increasing alleles and an increased risk of hypothyroidism, whereas opposite effect directions were seen for FT3 (Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 21). Also, the PGS for TSH was associated with a lower risk of secondary hypothyroidism and (non)toxic (multi)nodular goiter. The PGS for FT4 was associated with a higher risk of thyrotoxicosis. Genetic associations with cardiac diseases were observed for increased FT3 concentrations demonstrating an increased risk of cardiac dysrhythmias, in particular atrial fibrillation and flutter, while genetic predisposition to high TSH levels was associated with a higher risk of coronary atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the results suggested that thyroid function-related genetic variants, particularly the variants associated with high TSH levels, also play a role in the development of autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves' disease and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis also known as Hashimoto's disease), celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and sicca (Sjögren) syndrome. The PGS for reference range TSH was also associated with a lower risk of thyroid and breast cancers.

### Assessment of the relationship between genetic determinants of thyroid function and atrial fibrillation: a mendelian randomization study [^111hNaHL]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Increased free thyroxine (FT4) and decreased thyrotropin are associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies, but direct involvement is unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the potential direct involvement of thyroid traits on AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Study-level mendelian randomization (MR) included 11 studies, and summary-level MR included 55 114 AF cases and 482 295 referents, all of European ancestry.

Exposures

Genomewide significant variants were used as instruments for standardized FT4 and thyrotropin levels within the reference range, standardized triiodothyronine (FT3):FT4 ratio, hypothyroidism, standardized thyroid peroxidase antibody levels, and hyperthyroidism. Mendelian randomization used genetic risk scores in study-level analysis or individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 2-sample MR for the summary-level data.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalent and incident AF.

Results

The study-level analysis included 7679 individuals with AF and 49 233 referents (mean age [standard error], 62 [3] years; 15 859 men [29.7%]). In study-level random-effects meta-analysis, the pooled hazard ratio of FT4 levels (nanograms per deciliter) for incident AF was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.09–2.20; P = 0.02; I2 = 76%) and the pooled odds ratio (OR) for prevalent AF was 2.80 (95% CI, 1.41–5.54; P = 0.003; I2 = 64%) in multivariable-adjusted analyses. The FT4 genetic risk score was associated with an increase in FT4 by 0.082 SD (standard error, 0.007; P < .001) but not with incident AF (risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62–1.14; P = 0.27) or prevalent AF (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.64–2.73; P = 0.46). Similarly, in summary-level inverse-variance weighted random-effects MR, gene-based FT4 within the reference range was not associated with AF (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89–1.14; P = 0.88). However, gene-based increased FT3:FT4 ratio, increased thyrotropin within the reference range, and hypothyroidism were associated with AF with inverse-variance weighted random-effects OR of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.08–1.63; P = 0.006), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.92; P < .001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90–0.99; P = 0.009), respectively, and robust to tests of horizontal pleiotropy. However, the subset of hypothyroidism single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in autoimmunity and thyroid peroxidase antibodies levels were not associated with AF. Gene-based hyperthyroidism was associated with AF with MR-Egger OR of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.05–1.63; P = 0.02) with evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (P = 0.045).

Conclusions and Relevance

Genetically increased FT3:FT4 ratio and hyperthyroidism, but not FT4 within the reference range, were associated with increased AF, and increased thyrotropin within the reference range and hypothyroidism were associated with decreased AF, supporting a pathway involving the pituitary-thyroid-cardiac axis.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^116Xxy5J]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

The main strength of this study was the large cohort of unselected subjects from primary care who had thyroid screening performed. However, as it was an observational study, it is not possible to draw direct conclusions on causal relationships of the findings. Specifically, it is impossible with the available data to explore the reasons for each individual subject undergoing thyroid screening. One can speculate that subjects who had a known thyroid problem would be more prone subsequently to have electrocardiograms taken (implicating surveillance bias). However, this does not explain the "dose-response" relationship we found between TSH levels and risk of atrial fibrillation.

The study was based on administrative registers that did not include clinical parameters correlated to outcome, such as body mass index, smoking status, serum lipid levels, thyroid autoantibody levels, and echocardiographic or electrocardiographic findings. Neither did we have data on the types of hyperthyroidism, such as Graves' disease or nodular disease.

Patients were categorised by only their first time thyroid screening, and we did not take into account the possibility that subjects in the euthyroid group might develop thyroid dysfunction during follow-up and subsequently atrial fibrillation or that possible undertreatment or overtreatment of patients with thyroid dysfunction might alter their risk of atrial fibrillation due to changes in TSH and free thyroxine levels. However, a sensitivity analysis with time dependent adjustment for treatment defined as any thyroid related diagnosis or thyroid related medication did not alter the results significantly.

Also, we were unable to detect patients with new onset atrial fibrillation not diagnosed at a hospital who were treated by their general practitioner nor patients with asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which could lead to detection bias. However, most patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in Denmark have a hospital admission or contact with an outpatient hospital clinic and the atrial fibrillation diagnosis in the Danish registers has previously been validated and has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88–99%. Furthermore, the possibility of asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the cohort would probably be non-differential or bias towards the null hypothesis.

The Danish population comprises mainly white people, and so extrapolation of these results to other ethnic groups should be done with care.

Conclusions

In a population based sample of primary care patients who were subjected to thyroid function blood tests, we found a TSH level dependent relation between the degree of thyroid dysfunction and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation. Our results showed that even discrete subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Notably, both subclinical and overt hypothyroidism were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. These results support long term screening for atrial fibrillation in patients with thyroid disease.

Hyperthyroidism — anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF): In patients with hyperthyroidism and AF who have an elevated risk of stroke based on a standard clinical risk score, anticoagulation is recommended until thyroid function has returned to normal and sinus rhythm can be maintained (1 B-NR). Restoration of sinus rhythm is unlikely until a euthyroid state has been achieved, and in 1 study, spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm occurred at a median of 1 to 3 weeks after thyroid hormone levels returned to normal.

### Thyroid function effect on cardiac structure, cardiac function, and disease risk: evidence of causal associations in European ancestry [^1123eMcP]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in cardiovascular physiology. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but evidence is mixed regarding causality.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential causal relationships of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism with cardiovascular outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke, as well as their effect on cardiac structure and function assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

A comprehensive 2-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using summary data from large-scale meta-analyses of European ancestry individuals.

Results

Genetically determined lower TSH levels (odds ratio 0.928; 95% confidence interval 0.884–0.974; P = 0.003) and genetic risk of hyperthyroidism (odds ratio 1.049; 95% confidence interval 1.016–1.083; P = 0.003) were associated with increased AF risk. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. Colocalization and multivariable Mendelian randomization revealed height as a key mediator between TSH/hyperthyroidism and AF. These findings were further corroborated in the independent FinnGen cohort. However, no clear evidence was found for relationships between thyroid function and other cardiovascular outcomes and cardiac structure and function.

Conclusion

Our study shows that reduced TSH levels and hyperthyroidism heighten AF risk, with height serving as an important mediator in these associations. The primary focus of thyroid management in cardiovascular health should be on preventing and treating arrhythmias, particularly AF. Our research highlights the importance of routine screening and timely treatment of thyroid dysfunction to optimize the prevention and management of arrhythmias.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^113yPwQn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Kaplan‐Meier analysis and the log‐rank test revealed that the atrial tachyarrhythmia–free survival after the first session was significantly different among quartile groups, with quartile 4 showing the lowest survival (P = 0.027) (Figure 2 A). This trend became more prominent in the analysis of event‐free survival after the last session (P = 0.017) (Figure 2 B). Event‐free survivals were still better in quartile 4 than in the hypothyroidism group (Figures 1 and 2). Accordingly, we regarded quartile 4 as a subgroup with a high risk of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence as well as the hypothyroidism group and compared the event‐free survivals of quartile 4 with those of the combined quartile 1 to 3 group. The patients in quartile 4 had significantly worse event‐free survival than those in quartile 1 to 3, both after the first session (crude HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14–2.19; P = 0.006 by Cox hazard analysis) (Figure 3 A) and after the last session (crude HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.28–3.50; P = 0.003) (Figure 3 B). The differences appeared to be more prominent in patients with paroxysmal AF after both the first (crude HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.14–2.73; P = 0.010) (Figure 3 C) and last (crude HR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.86–9.29; P < 0.001) (Figure 3 D) sessions. On the other hand, differences were not statistically significant in patients with nonparoxysmal AF after either the first session (crude HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.84–2.27; P = 0.21) (Figure 3 E) or the last session (crude HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.67–2.59; P = 0.42) (Figure 3 F). Notably, the event‐free survivals in quartile 4 with paroxysmal AF were similar to those in patients with nonparoxysmal AF.

### Free thyroxine within the normal reference range predicts risk of atrial fibrillation [^111M8s4s]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism is a known precipitating factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, recent reports have suggested an increased risk of AF with free thyroxine (fT4) levels even within the upper reference (normal) range. We sought to test whether higher fT4 levels within the reference range are associated with an increased risk of AF.

Methods and Results

All patients in the Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical record database with an fT4 level not on thyroid medication were included. The reference range of fT4 was divided into quartiles (Q), and associations with prevalent and incident AF were assessed by multivariable regression. Similar analyses were performed for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and total and free T3. A total of 174914 patients were included and followed for 7.0 ± 4.9 years. Of these, 7.4%, 88.4%, and 4.2% had fT4 levels below, within, and above the reference range. As expected, prevalent AF was greater with elevated fT4. However, gradients also were noted within the reference range, comparing Q4 to Q1, for prevalent AF (adjusted odds ratio 1.4, P < .0001) and incident AF (adjusted hazard ratio 1.16, P < .0001). In contrast, no relationship with AF prevalence and incidence was noted for total and free T3 within their reference ranges, and the pattern for TSH was uninformative.

Conclusion

Higher fT4 levels within the reference range were associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of AF. These findings in a large dataset prospectively validate earlier reports and may have important implications, including a redefinition of the normal range and fT4 targets for replacement therapy.

### Results from the loire-ardèche-Drôme-isère-puy-de-Dôme (LADIP) trial on atrial flutter, a multicentric prospective randomized study comparing amiodarone and radiofrequency ablation after the first episode of symptomatic atrial flutter [^117FRYyx]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There is no published randomized study comparing amiodarone therapy and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) after only 1 episode of symptomatic atrial flutter (AFL). The aim of the Loire-Ardèche-Drôme-Isère-Puy-de-Dôme (LADIP) Trial of Atrial Flutter was 2-fold: (1) to prospectively compare first-line RFA (group I) versus cardioversion and amiodarone therapy (group II) after only 1 AFL episode; and (2) to determine the impact of both treatments on the long-term risk of subsequent atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods and Results

From October 2002 to February 2006, 104 patients (aged 78 ± 5 years; 20 women) with AFL were included, with 52 patients in group I and 52 patients in group II. The cumulative risk of AFL or AF was interpreted with the use of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Clinical presentation, echocardiographic data, and follow-up were as follows: age (78.5 ± 5 versus 78 ± 5 years), history of AF (27% versus 21.6%); structural heart disease (58% versus 65%), left ventricular ejection fraction (56 ± 14% versus 54.5 ± 14%), left atrial size (43 ± 7 versus 43 ± 6 mm), mean follow-up (13 ± 6 versus 13 ± 6 months; P = NS), recurrence of AFL (3.8% versus 29.5%; P < 0.0001), and occurrence of significant AF beyond 10 minutes (25% versus 18%; P = 0.3). Five complications (10%) were noted in group II (sick sinus syndrome in 2, hyperthyroidism in 1, and hypothyroidism in 2) and none in group I (0%) (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

RFA should be considered a first-line therapy even after the first episode of symptomatic AFL. There is a better long-term success rate, the same risk of subsequent AF, and fewer secondary effects.

### Thyroid function and the risk of atrial fibrillation… [^111gPeJo]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with increased risks of heart failure, stroke, and death. 1 Despite its importance, current treatment approaches involving antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation carry modest efficacy and significant risks. 2 Development of new therapeutic strategies is desirable and may potentially be guided by known clinical risk factors for the arrhythmia. Epidemiologic studies have identified observational associations between multiple clinical conditions and AF, including hypertension, obesity, and thyroid dysfunction. 3–5 Targeting biological pathways and lifestyle factors relevant to these conditions may serve as effective preventive therapy for AF; however, it is imperative to note that an observational association may not be reflective of a forward causal relationship.

Attempting to decipher causality for observational associations is critical given that interventions on factors external to a causal pathway are less likely to achieve the desired effect on the outcome.

### Effects of amiodarone therapy on thyroid function [^115cXa2K]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative approved for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Traditionally classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, amiodarone possesses electrophysiologic properties of all four Vaughan-Williams classes. This drug, however, has high iodine content, and this feature plus the intrinsic effects on the body make amiodarone especially toxic to the thyroid gland. Treatment can result in a range of effects from mild derangements in thyroid function to overt hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis and treatment of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is usually straightforward, whereas that of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and the ability to distinguish between the type 1 and type 2 forms of the disease are much more challenging. Dronedarone was approved in 2009 for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation. As amiodarone, dronedarone is a benzofuran derivative with similar electrophysiologic properties. In contrast to amiodarone, however, dronedarone is structurally devoid of iodine and has a notably shorter half-life. In studies reported before FDA approval, dronedarone proved to be associated with significantly fewer adverse effects than amiodarone, making it a more attractive choice for patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, who are at risk of developing amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^1118SqQg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Treating overt hyperthyroidism prevents atrial fibrillation (AF). Though subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) has been associated with AF, it is unknown whether treating SH prevents AF.

Objective

We aimed to identify the association between treating SH and incident AF.

Design

In a pharmacoepidemiologic retrospective cohort study, patients diagnosed with SH between 2000 and 2021 were followed.

Patients

Outpatients ≥ 18 years with biochemical SH and without prior AF, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, pituitary disease, or pregnancy were included.

Main Outcomes

The primary outcome was incident AF. Secondary outcomes were ECG and echocardiographic features associated with AF.

Results

Of 2169 patients screened, 360 (131 treated and 229 untreated) were followed up for a mean of 4.27 years. In the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 4 (3.1%) and 15 (6.6%) patients (p = 0.15), and AF incidence was 0.8% and 1.4%/year (p = 0.31), respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for treatment as a time-dependent variable was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19–1.92; p = 0.39). As some cases of AF were documented nearly simultaneously with SH treatment, a sensitivity analysis was performed reassigning two patients diagnosed with AF < 30 days after starting SH treatment to the untreated group. Here, in the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 1.6% and 7.4% (p = 0.02), and AF incidence was 0.4% and 1.8%/year (p = 0.02), respectively. The HR was 0.25 (0.06–1.13; p = 0.07). There were no differences in ECG or echocardiographic features.

Conclusion

There was an overall trend towards lower incidence and prevalence of AF following treatment of SH, supporting the need for larger scale studies.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^114zygcR]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

We identified a total of 586 460 individuals from 2000–10 who had their thyroid function evaluated for the first time by their general practitioner and who were without previously recorded thyroid disease or atrial fibrillation. Figure 1shows the selection of the study cohort. Table 2shows baseline characteristics of the euthyroid patients and the groups of patients with thyroid dysfunction. Women predominated (61%) in the study cohort and where slightly younger (about 2 years) than the men. The cohort had low degree of comorbidity, and there was a uniform distribution of socioeconomic status as estimated by yearly income. On average the patients with thyroid dysfunction were older and more commonly women. The group of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism were significantly older than individuals in the other groups.

Incidence of atrial fibrillation

During the follow-up of 3 215 807 person years (median follow-up time 5.5 years), a total of 17 154 (2.9%) patients had a hospital diagnosis of first time atrial fibrillation, of whom 53% were women. Of these hospital diagnoses, in 52% the atrial fibrillation was the primary reason for hospitalisation. Among the euthyroid subjects, 2.9% developed atrial fibrillation, in contrast to 4.6% of patients with hyperthyroidism and 2.5% with hypothyroidism. Table 3shows the unadjusted and age adjusted incidence rates for atrial fibrillation stratified by age and sex.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^115tKe2Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Context

Treating overt hyperthyroidism prevents atrial fibrillation (AF). Though subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) has been associated with AF, it is unknown whether treating SH prevents AF.

Objective

We aimed to identify the association between treating SH and incident AF.

Design

In a pharmacoepidemiologic retrospective cohort study, patients diagnosed with SH between 2000 and 2021 were followed.

Patients

Outpatients ≥ 18 years with biochemical SH and without prior AF, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, pituitary disease, or pregnancy were included.

Main Outcomes

The primary outcome was incident AF. Secondary outcomes were ECG and echocardiographic features associated with AF.

Results

Of 2169 patients screened, 360 (131 treated and 229 untreated) were followed up for a mean of 4.27 years. In the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 4 (3.1%) and 15 (6.6%) patients (p = 0.15), and AF incidence was 0.8% and 1.4%/year (p = 0.31), respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for treatment as a time‐dependent variable was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19–1.92; p = 0.39). As some cases of AF were documented nearly simultaneously with SH treatment, a sensitivity analysis was performed reassigning two patients diagnosed with AF < 30 days after starting SH treatment to the untreated group. Here, in the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 1.6% and 7.4% (p = 0.02), and AF incidence was 0.4% and 1.8%/year (p = 0.02), respectively. The HR was 0.25 (0.06–1.13; p = 0.07). There were no differences in ECG or echocardiographic features.

Conclusion

There was an overall trend towards lower incidence and prevalence of AF following treatment of SH, supporting the need for larger scale studies.

### Amiodarone and thyroid physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1113fAZY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Although amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, its use is limited by a wide variety of potential toxicities. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive "bench to bedside" overview of the ways amiodarone influences thyroid function. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2017. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, hypothyroidism, myxedema, hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and electrical storm. Google and Google scholar as well as bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed for additional references. We included 163 germane references in this review. Because amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs in the United States, the mechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic information provided is relevant for practicing clinicians in a wide range of medical specialties.

### History of thyroid disorders in relation to clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation [^112zvYW2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac complication of hyperthyroidism. The association between history of hyperthyroidism and stroke remains unclear. We sought to determine whether history of thyroid dysfunction is a thromboembolic risk factor in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

Patients with atrial fibrillation seen in an academic institution between 2000 and 2010 were identified and followed-up. Clinical events (stroke/systemic embolism, bleeding, all-cause death) were recorded and related to thyroid status and disorders. Associations were examined in time-dependent models with adjustment for relevant confounders.

Results

Among 8962 patients, 141 patients had a history of hyperthyroidism, 540 had a history of hypothyroidism, and 8271 had no thyroid dysfunction. Mean follow-up was 929 ± 1082 days. A total of 715 strokes/systemic embolism were recorded, with no significant difference in the rates of these events in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction vs those without thyroid problems in either univariate or multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.76 for hyperthyroidism; HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73–1.34 for hypothyroidism). There were 791 bleeding events; history of hypothyroidism was independently related to a higher rate of bleeding events (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02–1.79). No significant difference among the 3 groups was observed for the incidence of death.

Conclusions

History of hyperthyroidism was not an independent risk factor for stroke/systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation, whereas hypothyroidism was associated with a higher risk of bleeding events. These data suggest no additional benefit from the inclusion of thyroid dysfunction in thromboembolic prediction models in atrial fibrillation.

### Unravelling sex disparities in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation: review of the current evidence [^116KDCmi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Collectively, many hormonal influences drive both structural and electrical changes in atrial tissue regardless of sex and diseases of the endocrine system can significantly predispose individuals to arrhythmias such as AF. The hormones that seem to have the greatest influence on AF risk in women compared to men are oestrogen and thyroid hormones.

Baseline Characteristics of the Subjects Assigned by TSH Levels

Table 2
Index Catheter Ablation Procedure Among Groups Assigned by TSH Levels

Two patients (0.4%) were unavailable for follow‐up before June 2016; however, their follow‐up periods were > 3 years and 33 months, respectively. With regard to clinical prognosis up to 3 years, atrial tachyarrhythmia recurred in 179 of 456 patients (39%) after the first session. Of them, 12 patients (2.6%) underwent repeated ablation within the 90‐day blanking period after the initial session because of uncontrollable symptoms of atrial tachyarrhythmia. The atrial tachyarrhythmia–free survival was marginally lower in the hypothyroidism group than in the normal TSH group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (crude hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95–2.93; P = 0.077 by Cox hazard analysis) (Figure 1 A). The hypothyroidism group showed significantly lower atrial tachyarrhythmia–free survival than the normal TSH group after the last session, with an average of 1.4 ± 0.6 ablation procedures (crude HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.56–6.31; P = 0.001 by Cox hazard analysis) (Figure 1 B). Multivariate analysis identified hypothyroidism (adjusted HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.07–4.84; P = 0.032) and amiodarone prescription (adjusted HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.14–4.33; P = 0.019) as the remaining significant predictors of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after the last session when adjusted by the following variables: age, sex, LAD, left ventricular ejection fraction, and paroxysmal AF.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) — minimum evaluation includes history and physical examination to define presence and nature of symptoms associated with AF; clinical type of AF (first episode, paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent); onset of the first symptomatic attack or date of discovery of AF; frequency, duration, precipitating factors, and modes of termination of AF; response to any pharmacological agents that have been administered; and presence of any underlying heart disease or other reversible conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism or alcohol consumption). Electrocardiogram is used to identify rhythm (verify AF), LV hypertrophy, P-wave duration and morphology or fibrillatory waves, preexcitation, bundle-branch block, prior MI, and other atrial arrhythmias, and to measure and follow the R-R, QRS, and QT intervals in conjunction with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram is used to identify valvular heart disease; LA and RA size; LV size and function; peak RV pressure (pulmonary hypertension); LV hypertrophy; LA thrombus (low sensitivity); and pericardial disease. Blood tests of thyroid, renal, and hepatic function are specified for a first episode of AF, when the ventricular rate is difficult to control.

### Characteristics and outcomes of atrial fibrillation in patients with thyroid disease (from the ARISTOTLE trial) [^113Qgwcm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and thyroid disease are clinically distinct from those with AF and no thyroid disease is unknown. Furthermore, the effectiveness of anticoagulation for prevention of AF-related thromboembolic events in patients with thyroid disease has not been adequately studied. Patients enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation, which compared apixaban with warfarin in patients with AF (n = 18,201), were categorized by thyroid disease history at randomization (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and no thyroid disease). Adjusted hazard ratios derived from Cox models were used to compare outcomes by thyroid disease history. Associations between randomized treatment and outcomes by thyroid disease history were examined using Cox models with interaction terms. A total of 18,021/18,201 (99%) patients had available thyroid disease history at randomization: 1,656 (9%) had hypothyroidism, 321 (2%) had hyperthyroidism, and 16,044 (89%) had no thyroid disease. When compared with those without a history of thyroid disease, patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism were more likely to be female (60.4% vs 32.1%; 52.0% vs 32.1%; both p < 0.0001). Patients with hypothyroidism were older (73 vs 70 years, p < 0.0001) and more likely to have had previous falls (8.7% vs 4.3%, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in clinical outcomes by thyroid disease history. The benefit of apixaban compared with warfarin was similar regardless of thyroid disease history (interaction p > 0.10). In conclusion, despite differences in baseline characteristics of patients with and without thyroid disease, their clinical outcomes were similar. The benefit of apixban compared with warfarin was preserved regardless of thyroid disease history.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^117H1FU9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation [^1173H7s8]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is characterized by a clearly low serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) and the absence of obvious symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Whether or not all persons with a low value for serum TSH can be considered subclinically hyperthyroid is uncertain, but the low serum TSH per se is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation and perhaps other cardiovascular disease. Screening all persons, even in the older age groups, for subclinical hyperthyroidism may not be justified in and of itself but such persons would likely be screened for subclinical hypothyroidism and so those with subclinical hyperthyroidism identified. There are no controlled trials that show the benefit of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism, thus therapy at present needs to be determined by clinical judgement, aided by monitoring the patient to see if the low serum TSH level persists and assessing the presence or absence of other determinants of therapy such as an elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration, a multinodular goiter, or the appearance of overt symptoms.

Methods

Search strategy

This meta-analysis follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Checklist (Additional file 1). We searched PubMed and Embase from inception to 29 February 2016, using the following text and key words, both as MeSH terms and text words: hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, thyroid diseases, thyroid function, thyroid status, coronary heart diseases, ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, death, mortality, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, peripheral artery diseases. We searched articles published in any language and screened references from these studies to identify other relevant studies. YN and YJC performed the literature search independently. Differences were resolved by discussion.

Inclusion criteria

To minimize differences, studies were required (1) to measure thyroid function and follow persons prospectively; to assess ischemic heart disease (IHD), mortality or other cardiovascular events; and to provide risk estimates or sufficient data to calculate risk estimates associated with hypothyroidism compared with euthyroidism; (2) to be cohort studies published as original articles; and (3) to be independent. For multiple publications of the same study design, we included the estimates from the most recent or informative reports.

### The spectrum of thyroid disease and risk of new onset atrial fibrillation: a large population cohort study [^114N44jV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

†Attributable risk percent = (IRR−1)/IRR×100.

Overall, age adjusted incidence rates for atrial fibrillation were lower in patients with overt hypothyroidism and higher in patients with overt hyperthyroidism compared with the euthyroid cohort. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had incidence rates similar to those of the euthyroid cohort, whereas the subclinical hyperthyroid patients had markedly higher rates of atrial fibrillation. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism had higher age adjusted rates of atrial fibrillation than those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Figure 2shows the cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation for patients aged > 65 years. Of 122 351 individuals included in the competing risk calculations, 11 879 (10%) had an event of atrial fibrillation, 42 213 (34%) died, and 68 259 (56%) were censored because of migration or end of the study period.

Fig 2 Cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation in relation to thyroid dysfunction at baseline thyroid screening (age > 65 years). Values adjusted for competing risk of death from all causes

Age adjusted rates of atrial fibrillation for levels of high normal thyroid function and two levels of subclinical hyperthyroidism showed a uniform development from low rates in euthyroid subjects to higher rates in subclinical hyperthyroidism with suppressed TSH (table 4). Figure 3shows unadjusted incidence rates and adjusted incidence rate ratios.

### What is the association of hypothyroidism with risks of cardiovascular events and mortality? A meta-analysis of 55 cohort studies involving 1, 898, 314 participants [^11181Aw4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and stroke, HF, MI, AF, and total cardiovascular events

For stroke, nine studies were included, reporting 27,196 events among 761,993 participants. All studies adjusted for age, eight adjusted for sex, most adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, and only one adjusted for RT. The overall RR of stroke was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96–1.24; Fig. 6) with moderate heterogeneity (I 2: 52.3%; P = 0.03). After excluding one outlier study with population > 10,000, RR changed slightly with no heterogeneity (I 2: 0.0%; P = 0.43).

Fig. 6
Relative risk (RR) of stroke and heart failure (HF) associated with hypothyroidism compared with euthyroidism. The dotted line in forest plot represents pooled RR value in random effects model. CI confidence interval

Of eight studies analyzed with HF, there were 23,033 events among 599,876 participants. Seven studies adjusted for age, all adjusted for sex, most adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, and only two adjusted for RT. Evidence synthesis for HF did not show a significant association with hypothyroidism (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.98–1.30; Fig. 6), with moderate heterogeneity across studies (I 2: 54.8%; P = 0.03). After excluding one outlier study, the heterogeneity decreased with the pooled RR still insignificant. We performed an additional subgroup analysis of risk of HF by mean age (Additional file 2: Table S5). The risk estimates did not significantly change in each subgroup.

Seven studies involving 588,182 participants were analyzed reporting a total of 13,263 MI. Six studies adjusted for age, four adjusted for sex, most adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, and none adjusted for RT. Hypothyroidism was significantly associated with higher risk of MI (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.05–1.25; Fig. 7), with no heterogeneity (I 2: 0.0%; P = 0.43). The same results were obtained after using fixed-effect models, inclusion of large cohorts, studies without RT at baseline, or high-quality studies.

### Global burden of atrial fibrillation and flutter by national income: results from the global burden of disease 2019 database [^113p1F2H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Strengths

There are several limitations to this study. First, data from 3 different databases (GBD database, WHO data repository, World Bank database) was used and joined. Each of these databases uses different approaches and methodology to generate its data and has its own limitations. The limitations of the GBD database have been previously described elsewhere. In brief, the availability, quality, and quantity of primary data varies greatly between regions depending on the existence and quality of the respective data sources and are fraught with uncertainties and inconsistencies, which is reflected in the large CIs. As far as it is assessable, the primary data often consist of random samplings and extrapolations, which may cause distortions and significant variability. In the absence of primary data, the GBD collaborators have used estimation models to provide this comprehensive data set. To our knowledge, there are limited attempts to externally validate these estimations with other data sets or estimations. The quality of all estimations, such as future trends or underlying risk factors relies on the respective statistical models that have been used and need to be assessed with caution for their uncertainties and potential errors. The analysis of underlying risk factors is limited to those factors that are included in the GBD database. Several important known risk factors for AF/AFL are missing. Among them are, for example, systolic or diastolic heart failure, valvular disease, sleep apnea, or thyroid disease. Also, rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease are not analyzed as underlying risk factors in the GBD risk factor estimation, though it is a common risk for AF/AFL with important therapeutic consequences. As discussed above, AF/AFL as an often‐intermittent condition usually is underdiagnosed, in particular in countries with less diagnostic resources. Some of the primary data used in this databank relies on diagnoses assigned by the routine health care. The GBD data are observational and thus susceptible to many biases and confounders, and challenges in the interpretation of such results like reverse causality need to be taken into consideration. Also, countries were grouped according to national income. We cannot discriminate a significant proportion of confounding or reverse causality, as these countries differ not only in income but also in other aspects that could be relevant in this setting, such as socioeconomic status, health care infrastructure, and racial differences. Therefore, it should not be assumed that national income is causal for the incidence of AF/AFL, but rather that it correlates with several potentially causal factors.

### High-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone shows a potential causal association with arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115t1Eov]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 477 patients, 21 with TSH levels below the reference range were excluded from analysis because of suspected hyperthyroidism. Among the 23 patients with TSH levels above the normal range, 11 showed free thyroxine levels lower than the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) and 12 showed normal free thyroxine levels (so‐called subclinical hypothyroidism). Both were combined into one group as hypothyroidism group for analysis. Among patients whose TSH levels were within the normal range (so‐called euthyroidism), we compared data of the high‐normal TSH group (the highest quartile of TSH levels, quartile 4) with those of the remaining patients (quartile 1–3) in addition to comparisons among the 4 quartiles.

Hypothyroidism Versus Euthyroidism

Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The mean TSH levels in the hypothyroidism group (n = 23) were ≈6‐fold higher than those in the normal TSH group (n = 433) (9.80 ± 10.44 versus 1.56 ± 0.79 μIU/mL; P < 0.001). The mean free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine levels in the hypothyroidism group were significantly lower than those in the normal TSH group. The patients with hypothyroidism had larger LAD (43.1 ± 6.9 versus 39.0 ± 6.8 mm; P = 0.006), included less paroxysmal AF (34.8% versus 58.0%; P = 0.032), and were more frequently taking class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone (26.1% versus 5.8%; P = 0.003), than those with the normal TSH group. In terms of catheter ablation procedures, all patients underwent PVI. Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was added to most patients. However, additional substrate‐modifying procedures, such as ablation of continuous fractionated atrial electrogram, LA lines, ganglionated plexi ablation, and superior vena cava isolation, were only performed in limited numbers of patients. No significant differences in add‐on ablation procedures were observed among the patient groups, as shown in Table 2.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^113RGFRm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional limitations include the small sample size and small number of events despite screening over 2000 patients, the single‐centre and retrospective design. Reference ranges for thyroid function tests changed over time, creating heterogeneity, particularly posing challenges with our subgroup analysis based on thyroid function tests. Moreover, given our methodology followed an intention‐to‐treat approach, we did not examine whether and how long after the start of treatment euthyroidism was established in each participant. In clinical practice, those treated for hyperthyroidism or SH may not consistently develop and maintain euthyroidism. Avoiding the exclusion of those with abnormal thyroid function tests mimics the real clinical scenario more closely. Finally, insufficient clinical information was available for 420 of the patients with SH within the hospital EMRs. This may represent a selection bias as patients whose SH might have been addressed outside of the main academic hospitals were excluded.

Our findings though not conclusive, along with similar recently published literature, suggest that treatment of SH to prevent AF should be considered, particularly in those with AF risk factors. We also showed that patients with SH secondary to toxic nodules are more likely to develop AF and, therefore, the aetiology of SH should be considered when deciding on treatment. Finally, TSH and FT4 levels may be factored into decisions regarding SH treatment. Our results support the need for a larger prospective study, ideally a randomized trial, assessing the effect of SH treatment in preventing AF. Additional questions raised by this research include whether early versus delayed approach to treatment of SH would make a difference in the incidence of AF and whether unique patient and disease characteristics would allow for active surveillance of patients with SH with minimal risk of developing AF.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^116sy5TE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, which is characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, coexisting cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and coexisting infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate vs. rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^115dfjNt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)

AF is associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism and therefore is a potential risk of thyroid over-replacement for SCH. It should not occur if TSH is maintained in the normal range, however we pay particular attention to identifying this possible adverse event.

Cardiac rhythm is determined at study baseline, and new onset AF, paroxysmal or persisting, is diagnosed from an annual single-lead electrocardiograph, or if noted on 12-lead electrocardiograph or telemetry performed as part of hospitalisation or other clinical care, or if identified by inquiry about hospitalisations and out-patient visits (at all patient contacts). This general process of screening for atrial fibrillation has been found to be very sensitive for identifying new cases.

We use a single-lead recorder (Omron HeartScan HCG-801-E). This provides a simple and quick assessment of cardiac rhythm; it has been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy for AF (sensitivity 99%, specificity 96%) compared to a standard 12-lead electrocardiograph.

Heart failure

Prevalent heart failure and incident heart failure diagnosis / hospitalisations will be recorded, as this outcome is a potential risk of thyroid dysfunction and of thyroid hormone over replacement.

Fracture

Musculoskeletal effects of Levothyroxine are described, including osteopenia/ osteoporosis. We record all new fractures and all new diagnoses of osteoporosis. Formal screening for osteoporosis is not required for this trial.

Study monitoring and auditing

Study monitoring visits are conducted according to a study-specific monitoring plan devised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and subsequent monitoring reports are reviewed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. At a minimum, each site was monitored before the study commenced (Study Initiation), study visit(s) and at the end of the trial (Study Close Out Visit). Additional monitoring visits were undertaken if required and the study was subject to routine or for-cause audit visits. Investigators and site staff were notified in advance of any audit and/or monitoring visits.

### Hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^116jer86]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a common disorder affecting multiple systems in the body. The cardiovascular effects are among the most striking. The availability of effective treatments for hyperthyroidism has led to the widespread perception that it is a reversible disorder without any long-term consequences. Recent evidence suggests, however, that there may be adverse outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed increased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in those with a past history of overt hyperthyroidism treated with radioiodine, as well as those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones are known to exert direct effects on the myocardium, as well as the systemic vasculature and predispose to dysrhythmias, especially supraventricular. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a recognized complication of overt hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism is also known to be a risk factor for development of AF. Supraventricular dysrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, in older patients may account for some of the excess cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality described, especially because AF is known to predispose to embolic phenomena.

### A deeper understanding of the causal relationships between thyroid function and atrial fibrillation [^1111QDfw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current study, Shi et al. used the MVMR approach to discover mediators for the causal relationship between variation in normal-range thyroid function and AF risk, next to the direct effects of thyroid hormone on the heart. For this, several physiologically plausible mediators were assessed in their study (eg, blood pressure, heart rate, and various cardiac structure parameters). Correction for height attenuated the effect of genetically predicted TSH levels on AF risk from –0.12 (± 0.02) to –0.06 (± 0.02) change in log-transformed odds ratio (± standard error) per a standard deviation increase in TSH. In this way, height was identified as the major independent mediator in the causal association between variation in normal-range thyroid function and AF risk. This finding is in line with well-documented effects of thyroid function on childhood growth as well as with previous observational studies showing that height positively correlates with AF risk. Importantly, the authors subsequently showed that height was not a mediator in the relation between thyroid function and AF when analyses were restricted to only those TSH-associated genetic variants which are also related to autoimmune thyroid disease. This supports the biological plausibility of their findings, since autoimmune thyroid disease usually presents in adulthood far after the completion of growth. The fact that the effects of genetically determined thyroid function on AF risk are partly mediated by height is not only interesting from a pathophysiological point of view, but also from a clinical perspective: as height is determined in early life, it is likely that correction of thyroid function in later life will not fully reverse the effects of variation in thyroid function on AF risk described in observational studies.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Unravelling sex disparities in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation: review of the current evidence [^117RRoRf]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Hormonal Influences on AF Pathophysiology and Incidence

The pathophysiology of AF is multifaceted, with sex hormones playing a significant role in its incidence and progression. Understanding the hormonal influences on AF can provide insights into sex disparities in AF prevalence and outcomes, particularly among postmenopausal women and those with thyroid dysfunction. Many hormones throughout the body exert significant pathophysiologic effects on atrial tissue, thereby contributing to both structural remodelling and arrhythmogenesis.

The primary mechanisms by which these hormones result in enhanced AF susceptibility are elevated atrial fibrosis, ion channel function disruption, and autonomic nervous system activation and activation of inflammatory pathways, primarily by enhancing transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) signalling. Sex differences in hormonal secretion or action are complex, and many of the hormones essential for daily homeostasis do not necessarily demonstrate any clear gender‐specific differences. However, diseases directly influencing hormone secretion often affect differing patient phenotypes and have a propensity for one gender.

Catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, enhance automaticity and triggered activity via activation of β‐adrenergic receptors, shortening both the action potential duration and the refractory periods, thereby increasing susceptibility to AF. Similarly, aldosterone promotes atrial fibrosis by stimulating fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, exacerbating potentially harmful electrical remodelling and inflammation.

Angiotensin II further drives atrial fibrosis through TGF‐β signalling and increases the heterogeneity of conduction, both of which elevate the risk of AF. Women, particularly premenopausal women, have lower angiotensin II activity due to oestrogen‐mediated suppression, reducing fibrosis and AF risk.

Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 amplify β‐adrenergic sensitivity, reducing action potential duration and refractory periods similar to catecholamines while simultaneously promoting atrial ectopy and re‐entry mechanisms. Thyroid hormones also play a crucial role in AF pathophysiology. Increased levels of thyroid hormones can lead to heightened sensitivity of the heart to catecholamines, resulting in shortened action potential duration and increased likelihood of AF. This relationship underscores the importance of monitoring thyroid function in AF patients, particularly those with underlying thyroid disorders. The pro‐arrhythmic signalling associated with thyroid dysfunction further complicates the hormonal landscape influencing AF, necessitating a comprehensive approach to patient management that considers cardiac and endocrine health. Thyroid disorders are some of the most common endocrinopathies in women before menopause. They are 3 to 5 times more common in women compared to men, and female sex is an independent risk factor for thyroid dysfunction, suggesting that these disorders, particularly if undiagnosed or untreated, may contribute to the enhanced AF morbidity in women, particularly in premenopausal women.

### Atrial fibrillation-a complex polygenetic disease [^115SW8AQ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is well known to contribute to cardiovascular morbidity, particularly AF. A mendelian randomization study by Salem et al. suggests a genetically determined variation in thyroid function within a physiologically normal range as a risk factor for AF. In 2019, Ellervik et al. found an association between genetically increased FT3:FT4 ratio and hyperthyroidism and AF. Thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism may increase the AF risk, whereas antithyroid medications to treat hyperthyroidism may reduce the risk of AF. This complicates the treatment of patients with subclinical thyroid disease, and the risk of AF should probably be considered in the clinical decision to treat these patients.

Genetic correlation between AF and other traits is illustrated in Fig. 2 (modified from Hadji-Turdeghal et al.). The most significant genetic correlation with AF is heart failure (p = 2 × 10 −13). Height was highly correlated with AF (p = 2 × 10 −33) and so was hypertension, a risk factor for AF (p = 1 × 10–12). Interestingly, other well-established risk factors for AF such as diabetes type 2 and alcohol dependence, had a non-significant correlation with AF (p = 2 × 10 −1).

METHODS

Study Design and Population

This study used records from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse from March 10, 1988 to October 20, 2021. The Corporate Data Warehouse is the national data repository of clinical and administrative records in the US VHA system, and includes patients in both hospitalized and ambulatory settings. Subjects' informed consent was waived, and study approval was obtained by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System Institutional Review Board. The data supporting this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Inclusion criteria were adults aged ≥ 18 years with an available TSH measured within 60 days of iodine contrast administration, and at least 30 days up to 1 year of a normal serum TSH level at baseline. Exclusion criteria were individuals with a history of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, thyroid surgery, thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine treatment, use of thyroid hormone or antithyroid medications, and use of other medications, which can interfere with serum thyroid function test results (Table S1). To extract non‐VA drug use and non–Corporate Data Warehouse electronic medical records, we also retrieved and cross‐referenced exclusion criteria against the VA Observation Medical Partnership Database. The flow of the study sample selection is shown in Figure 1.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular consequences: an alarming wake-up call? [^1123325Y]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction (STD), presenting as subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) or subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper), defined as abnormal serum thyrotropin (TSH) and normal free thyroid hormones, is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality. Depending on the degree of such dysfunction, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly atrial fibrillation, characterize both disorders and increase CV and total mortality compared to euthyroid persons. There are some differences in the mechanisms involved in the increased CV risk incurred by each type of STD, with more traditional CV risk factors clustered in SHypo than in SHyper, while the role of the TSH or its absence thereof, together with the respective, even subtle, changes incurred in thyroid hormone concentrations, seem to adversely influence the CV system in both types of STD. There is evidence that treatment of STD confers potential benefits by reducing CV events, however, no consensus has been reached due to lack of randomized controlled studies. Nevertheless, due to accumulating evidence from observational studies, many authorities agree that individuals with severe SHypo (TSH > 10 mIU/L) or grade 2 SHyper (TSH < 0.1 mIU/L) should receive treatment, mostly for the increased risk of CV morbidity and mortality. The evidence reviewed herein should alert and help the clinician to wake up to these two potentially alarming conditions of STD as they may confer serious CV complications, while their treatment appears quite beneficial.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases: 2016 update [^1145ew69]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction comprises subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by normal free thyroxine (FT4), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) with decreased or undetectable TSH and normal FT4. Up to 10% of the elderly have SHypo, which is usually asymptomatic. Individual participant data (IPD) analyses of prospective cohort studies from the international Thyroid Studies Collaboration show that SHypo is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1,58 for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, 95% CI 1.10–2.27), as well as increased risk of stroke, and heart failure (HF) for both higher and lower TSH. Small studies found that SHypo affects carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), diastolic function, peripheral vascular resistance, endothelial function, and lipid profile. SHyper is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16–2.43) and CHD events (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.46). The TSH threshold for initiating treatment is unclear. In the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the best evidence suggests SHypo therapy should be started at TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, and SHyper therapy at TSH < 0.1 mIU/L. Recommendations on screening are discordant, but most guidelines advocate that thyroid function should be checked in those at risk for hypothyroidism, those over 60, and those with known CHD and HF. This review updates current evidence on the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, as well as on screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Fig 1
Hazard ratios with 95% CIs for each of seven outcomes for different thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) categories relative to 2–2.5 mIU/L reference category. TIA = transient ischaemic attack

In the adjusted model, we observed no association between risk of atrial fibrillation and the lowest or highest TSH categories. However, we found a marginal protective effect at TSH concentrations of 0.1–0.4 mIU/L (hazard ratio 0.86 (0.74 to 1.00; P = 0.05) (fig 1 and supplementary table E).

We obtained similar results in age (≤ 65 and > 65 years) and sex stratified analyses (supplementary tables B-E). The association between the highest TSH concentration and increased risk of heart failure persisted in all subgroups, whereas the association with increased risk of ischaemic heart disease remained significant only in patients aged 65 years or under. The association between the lowest TSH categories and reduced risk of heart failure remained significant only in women and patients aged over 65 years. The protective effect on stroke/transient ischaemic attack of TSH concentrations of 3–10 mIU/L was evident only in women and patients aged over 65 years. TSH below 0.4 mIU/L was protective for atrial fibrillation in women, and TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L was protective for atrial fibrillation in patients aged 65 years or under.

All cause mortality

In the adjusted model, both the lowest and highest TSH concentrations were associated with increased mortality compared with the reference TSH category (hazard ratio 1.18 (1.08 to 1.28; P < 0.001), 1.29 (1.22 to 1.36; P < 0.001), and 2.21 (2.07 to 2.36; P < 0.001) for TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, 4–10 mIU/L, and > 10 mIU/L (fig 1 and supplementary table F).

In sex stratified subgroup analysis, the associations between the lowest and highest TSH concentrations and increased mortality remained significant in both men and women. We observed some evidence of reduced mortality in men with TSH 3–3.5 mIU/L (hazard ratio 0.88 (0.77 to 0.99). In age stratified analysis, the association between increased mortality and highest TSH remained in both the younger and older subgroups, but the association with lowest TSH became non-significant.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation [^116nEJNL]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atrial fibrillation is a well-known manifestation of hyperthyroidism. We studied whether subclinical hyperthyroidism with low serum thyrotropin concentrations and free thyroid hormone concentrations within the normal range in clinically euthyroid persons is a risk factor for subsequent atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We studied 23,638 persons. The subjects were classified according to their serum thyrotropin concentrations: group 1 comprised those with normal values of serum thyrotropin concentration (> 0.4–5.0 mU/L) and free tri-iodothyronine and free thyroxine concentrations were within the normal range (22,300 subjects), group 2 comprised those with both low serum thyrotropin values (≤ 0.03 mU/L) and elevated free tri-iodothyronine and free thyroxine concentrations (725 subjects), and group 3 comprised those with low values of serum thyrotropin (< 0.4 mU/L) and free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine concentrations were within the normal range (613 subjects).

Results

Atrial fibrillation was present in 513 persons (2.3%) in group 1 with normal values for serum thyrotropin, 100 (13.8%) in group 2 with overt hyperthyroidism, and 78 (12.7%) in group 3 with subclinical hyperthyroidism. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations (< 0.4 mU/L) was 13.3% compared with 2.3% in patients with normal values for serum thyrotropin (P < .01). The relative risk of atrial fibrillation in subjects with low serum thyrotropin and normal free tri-iodothyronine and free thyroxine concentrations, compared with those with normal concentrations of serum thyrotropin, was 5.2 (95% CI 2.1–8.7, P < .01).

Conclusion

A low serum thyrotropin concentration is associated with a > 5-fold higher likelihood for the presence of atrial fibrillation with no significant difference between subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism.

### Amiodarone induced thyroid dysfunction: a high cumulative incidence in a nationwide cohort study in Iceland [^117K28pQ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment effect of discontinuation of amiodarone or different medical therapies is difficult to interpret in retrospective studies. There is a selection bias in our groups, most clearly demonstrated by the different medical therapies that they receive and how treatment indication influences the decision to discontinue amiodarone treatment. Only 10% of patients with A.fib/flutter as the indication of treatment continued amiodarone compared with 67% if the indication was ventricular arrhythmia (Table 3). The sample size is too small to correct for these factors, making it unwise to draw any conclusions from the results.

Despite the high cumulative incidence rate, the prevalence of overt AIH in our study (9.2%) is low compared to findings in a recent meta‐analysis (14%) where the authors only considered overt hypothyroidism. Low prevalence could be explained by two methodological factors. First, six cases of hypothyroidism were considered a consequence of AIT and were not included. If they were included as AIH, then four cases (1.5%) of overt hypothyroidism would have been added to the prevalence. Second, further 4.2% were clinically diagnosed with and treated for AIH despite subclinical values. This may reflect early treatment of patients that were destined to progress to overt AIH, thereby lowering its occurrence.

Cases of ScAIH were included as AIH in our study, thus adding to the high cumulative incidence of AIH and AITD. Studies that depend on diagnostic codes for finding cases of AIH, for example, the Danish and German studies above, include them, while studies relying on laboratory tests for diagnosis of AIH, for example, the previously mentioned meta‐analysis, overlook them. The latter would lead to lower incidence rates. These patients are relevant both clinically and statistically because they receive treatment either by thyroid supplementation therapy or amiodarone discontinuation, in either way rendering them immune to AIH in the remaining follow‐up period of the study. In our investigation, 72.7% of cases diagnosed with AIH despite subclinical values received thyroxine treatment, demonstrating the importance of identifying and studying this group. ScAIH is seen in up to 12%–18% of the general population, and its treatment is controversial and must be individualized. Unnecessary treatment can have a negative effect on survival by increasing the risk of adverse cardiac events, especially in the elderly.

### Thyroid hormone therapy and incident stroke [^113hP4Pr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and there is a need to identify modifiable risk factors.

Objective

We aimed to determine the relationship between thyroid hormone treatment intensity and incidence of atrial fibrillation and stroke.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Health Administration between 2004 and 2017, with a median follow-up of 59 months. The study population comprised 733 208 thyroid hormone users aged ≥ 18 years with at least 2 thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) measurements between thyroid hormone initiation and incident event (atrial fibrillation or stroke) or study conclusion (406 030 thyroid hormone users with at least 2 free thyroxine [T4] measurements).

Results

Overall, 71 333/643 687 (11.08%) participants developed incident atrial fibrillation and 41 931/663 809 (6.32%) stroke. In multivariable analyses controlling for pertinent factors such as age, sex, and prior history of atrial fibrillation, higher incidence of stroke was associated with low TSH or high free T4 levels (ie, exogenous hyperthyroidism; eg, TSH < 0.1 mIU/L; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.24–1.43; free T4 > 1.9 ng/dL, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06–1.30) and high TSH or low free T4 levels (ie, exogenous hypothyroidism; eg, TSH > 5.5 mIU/L; OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26–1.33; free T4 < 0.7 ng/dL; OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22–1.35) compared with euthyroidism (TSH > 0.5–5.5 mIU/L and free T4 0.7–1.9 ng/dL). Risk of developing atrial fibrillation and stroke was cumulative over time for both patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

Conclusion

Both exogenous hyper- and hypothyroidism were associated with increased risk of stroke, highlighting the importance of patient medication safety.

### Thyroid function and dysfunction in relation to 16 cardiovascular diseases [^113CepMH]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction, defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone levels outside the reference range with normal free thyroxine levels in asymptomatic patients, is associated with alterations in cardiac hemodynamics. We used Mendelian randomization to assess the role of thyroid dysfunction for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with thyroid function were identified from a genome-wide association meta-analysis in up to 72167 individuals. Data for genetic associations with CVD were obtained from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of atrial fibrillation (n = 537409 individuals), coronary artery disease (n = 184305 individuals), and ischemic stroke (n = 438847) as well as from the UK Biobank (n = 367703 individuals).

Results

Genetically predicted thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and hyperthyroidism were statistically significantly associated with atrial fibrillation but no other CVDs at the Bonferroni-corrected level of significance (P < 7.8×10–4). The odds ratios of atrial fibrillation were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11–1.19; P = 2.4×10–14) per genetically predicted 1 SD decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03–1.08; P = 5.4×10–5) for genetic predisposition to hyperthyroidism. Genetically predicted free thyroxin levels were not statistically significantly associated with any CVD.

Conclusions

This Mendelian randomization study supports evidence for a causal association of decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in the direction of a mild form of hyperthyroidism with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation but no other CVDs.

### Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in athletes [^1128gNWv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, with an estimated prevalence of 0.4% to 1% in the general population, increasing with age to 8% in those above 80 years. The recognised risk factors for developing AF include age, structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of AF in patients below 60 years of age, in whom no cardiovascular disease or any other known causal factor is present, remain to be clarified. This condition, termed as lone AF, may be responsible for as many as 30% of patients with paroxysmal AF seeking medical attention. Recent studies suggest that long-term endurance exercise may increase the incidence of AF and atrial flutter (AFl) in this population. This review article is intended to analyse the prevalence of AF and AFl, the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the association between endurance sport practice and AF or AFl and the recommended therapeutic options in endurance athletes.

### Thyrotoxicosis-induced ventricular arrhythmias [^117LTJ23]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac arrhythmias associated with thyrotoxicosis tend to be supraventricular in nature with atrial fibrillation being the most common. Ventricular arrhythmias are rarely associated with thyrotoxicosis and are considered to be secondary to intrinsic cardiac disease.

Summary

We present three patients with thyrotoxicosis and stable coronary disease in whom the primary cardiac rhythm disturbance was ventricular tachycardia. In all of these patients, the ventricular arrhythmias terminated with achievement of a euthyroid state. We hypothesize that the thyrotoxic state contributed to the etiology of, or lowered the threshold for the ventricular arrhythmias.

Conclusion

Prompt attention to the management of thyrotoxicosis in patients with a history of significant heart disease is warranted in order to avoid potentially fatal arrhythmias.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Table 20 — typical maintenance antiarrhythmic dosing in atrial fibrillation (AF) lists daily dose ranges and key adverse effects: Amiodarone 100 to 400 mg with photosensitivity, pulmonary toxicity, polyneuropathy, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, bradycardia, torsades de pointes (rare), hepatic toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and eye complications; Disopyramide 400 to 750 mg with torsades de pointes, heart failure (HF), glaucoma, urinary retention, and dry mouth; Dofetilide 500 to 1000 mcg with torsades de pointes; Flecainide 200 to 300 mg with ventricular tachycardia, HF, and conversion to atrial flutter with rapid conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node; Propafenone 450 to 900 mg with ventricular tachycardia, HF, and conversion to atrial flutter with rapid AV conduction; and Sotalol 160 to 320 mg with torsades de pointes, HF, bradycardia, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive or bronchospastic lung disease. Footnotes note an amiodarone loading dose of 600 mg per day for one month or 1000 mg per day for 1 week and that sotalol dose should be adjusted for renal function and QT-interval response during in-hospital initiation.

### Lipid levels and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116caCUp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Second, the link between HDL‐C, LDL‐C, and new‐onset AF may be inflammation. 33 There is plausible evidence linking inflammation to the initiation and perpetuation of AF, 34 Inflammation is accompanied by an increase in cytokines, which leads to changes in metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. LDL‐C and HDL‐C levels are known to be reduced in inflammation, which is related to the action of inflammatory cytokines; low levels of LDL‐C and HDL‐C can reflect levels of inflammation. Cholesterol is present in blood as lipoproteins, including HDL‐C, LDL‐C, and very low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL‐C). Inflammation reduces the levels of HDL and LDL, resulting in decreasing serum levels of HDL‐C and LDL‐C. HDL metabolism is also tightly linked to reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process by which cholesterol is removed from peripheral cells and transported to the liver for metabolism and/or excretion. Several HDL‐associated proteins and a number of cell surface receptors play a key role in RCT and during infection and inflammation, there is a reduction in RCT that is attributable to multiple changes at each step in the pathway. 33 TG levels are known to increase in inflammation and several cytokines are known to increase TG levels. Higher levels of TG reflect the level of inflammation within the host, but in our study, there was no association between TG and new‐onset AF.

Third, old age and hyperthyroidism are associated with low cholesterol levels and increased incidence of AF, which may be confounding factors or reflections of a hidden link behind cholesterol and AF. The incidence of AF increases with age, especially in older populations. Thyroid hormones upregulate LDL‐C receptors and increase cholesterol catabolism and excretion, resulting in a decrease in TC and LDL‐C, whereas HDL‐C is reduced or unaffected. 35 Subclinical or clinical hyperthyroidism is strongly associated with the development of AF.

Fourth, Mora et al. found an inverse association between AF and cholesterol‐poor small LDL‐C particles and small VLDL particles, rather than with larger, cholesterol‐enriched particles. 17 This suggests that there are likely mechanisms beyond direct cholesterol effects underlying the observed association between LDL‐C and new‐onset AF. Further research is needed to fully understand these mechanisms.

Additionally, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have been linked to the presence of arrhythmias, particularly AF. Thyroid function is intricately connected to the cardiovascular system, with triiodothyronine (T3) exerting specific effects on cardiac function. A recent study found that, amongst individuals with normal thyroid function, 2.3% exhibit AF, whereas in those clinically diagnosed with hyperthyroidism the prevalence rises to 13.8%. Conversely, hypothyroidism exacerbates lipid metabolism disturbances, leading to adverse changes in the lipid profile, which in turn promote cholesterol plaque formation and the occurrence of ischaemic events. Apart from thyroid disorders, research has also investigated how the presence of OSA elevates the risk of AF, potentially through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, hypoxia, inflammation, atrial remodelling, and a significant genetic correlation involving single nucleotide polymorphisms. Furthermore, the severity of OSA independently contributes to an increased likelihood of AF‐related hospitalizations, as evidenced by findings from a population‐based study conducted in Western Australia.

Moreover, AF in young patients is related to structural heart disease, compared with older patients in whom lone AF has been mostly related to ischaemic heart disease and systemic disorders such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Patients with valvulopathies or non‐congenital heart diseases, such as dilated and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure exhibited a higher percentage of AF. Studies indicate that an increased alcohol consumption is associated with a greater risk of arrhythmias. AF and heart failure frequently coexist, as do AF and valvulopathies, although the question of whether AF predisposes individuals to these conditions, and vice versa, remains relatively controversial. Alternatively, the present study reveals that patients with PFO exhibit a lower prevalence of AF, according to a recent meta‐analysis demonstrating a higher preponderance of PFO in young individuals with IS, as opposed to the elevated prevalence of AF in older individuals with IS. From this, it can be inferred that in young patients without AF who have experienced an IS, an extensive investigation into unusual aetiologies and risk factors for stroke is performed, which could partially explain the higher rate of PFO diagnosis in the IS group without AF.

### Hypothyroidism [^116czisZ]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism is common, potentially serious, often clinically overlooked, readily diagnosed by laboratory testing, and eminently treatable. The condition is particularly prevalent in older women, in whom autoimmune thyroiditis is common. Other important causes include congenital thyroid disorders, previous thyroid surgery and irradiation, drugs such as lithium carbonate and amiodarone, and pituitary and hypothalamic disorders. Worldwide, dietary iodine deficiency remains an important cause. Hypothyroidism can present with nonspecific constitutional and neuropsychiatric complaints, or with hypercholesterolaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperprolactinaemia, or hyperhomocysteinaemia. Severe untreated hypothyroidism can lead to heart failure, psychosis, and coma. Although these manifestations are neither specific nor sensitive, the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded by measurements of serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine. Thyroxine replacement therapy is highly effective and safe, but suboptimal dosing is common in clinical practice. Patient noncompliance, drug interactions, and pregnancy can lead to inadequate treatment. Iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis can cause symptoms, and, even when mild, provoke atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis. We summarise present understanding of the history, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116EJtt3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — natural history and evidence for treatment notes that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years and about 2% to 5% develop "overt" thyroid dysfunction; one retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for heart disease events and overall mortality, but the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events, and it did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of "overt" hypothyroidism versus no treatment.
