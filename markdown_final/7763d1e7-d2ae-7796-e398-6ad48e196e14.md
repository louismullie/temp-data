## Question

Tirzepatide in T2DM with basal insulin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes when used with basal insulin, including how it compares with prandial insulin intensification and what practical guidance applies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why basal insulin intensification is often necessary. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial evidence, especially SURPASS-6, and extract key outcomes. Next, I will compare tirzepatide with prandial insulin across glycemic control, weight, hypoglycemia, and patient-reported outcomes. After that, I should review safety, tolerability, and dose-escalation strategies. Finally, I will integrate guideline perspectives and outline practical implementation, including insulin adjustments and monitoring, before summarizing a bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Many patients with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin remain above glycemic targets due to progressive beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance; traditional next steps include adding prandial insulin, but this brings risks of weight gain, hypoglycemia, and treatment burden, so alternatives that improve glycemia while limiting these downsides are clinically important [^b31dd19e] [^5e4fc8a4].

> I will now examine the pivotal evidence. SURPASS-6 randomized 1,428 adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin (with or without metformin) to once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or thrice-daily insulin lispro added to insulin glargine for 52 weeks; the primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at 52 weeks, and key secondary endpoints included weight change and hypoglycemia, which directly addresses the question of intensification strategy on basal insulin [^1d7988fc] [^dd30cd9f].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of glycemic benefit. At 52 weeks, tirzepatide reduced HbA1c by a mean 2.1% versus 1.1% with insulin lispro, yielding a treatment difference of −0.98% and achieving statistical superiority; importantly, 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants reached HbA1c less than 7.0% compared with 36% on lispro, indicating substantially higher odds of target attainment with tirzepatide intensification [^1d7988fc] [^dd30cd9f].

> Next, I should review weight outcomes, since this is a major differentiator. Tirzepatide produced a mean weight loss of 9.0 kg versus a 3.2 kg weight gain with insulin lispro, a net difference of −12.2 kg; this magnitude of weight reduction is unprecedented for a glucose-lowering agent in this setting and addresses a key limitation of prandial insulin intensification [^1d7988fc] [^dd30cd9f].

> Hold on, I should verify hypoglycemia risk. Clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.4% with tirzepatide versus 4.2% with insulin lispro, indicating an approximately 10-fold lower risk with tirzepatide; this is clinically meaningful given the hypoglycemia burden associated with basal-bolus regimens [^1d7988fc] [^dd30cd9f].

> I need to check patient-reported outcomes, because treatment burden matters. In SURPASS-6, tirzepatide improved health-related quality of life versus insulin lispro, likely reflecting less frequent injections, weight loss, and fewer hypoglycemic episodes; this aligns with broader observations that tirzepatide improves HRQoL across the SURPASS program, reinforcing its practical advantages in this population [^842e8fd6] [^beff5128].

> Let me consider insulin requirements, since basal insulin dose often rises with prandial addition. In SURPASS-6, tirzepatide enabled substantial reductions in total daily insulin dose, with 8% to 19% of participants discontinuing basal insulin entirely by week 52, whereas lispro intensification increased insulin burden; this dose-sparing effect is consistent with SURPASS-5, where tirzepatide reduced basal insulin requirements by roughly 13% to 11% versus a 75% increase in the placebo arm [^8000fa28] [^fa768107].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with tirzepatide and dose-related, but most were mild to moderate and decreased over time; slow dose escalation mitigates GI intolerance, and serious adverse events were not increased versus lispro, supporting a favorable overall safety profile in this context [^1d7988fc] [^5dc3eaf8].

> Next, I should review dose-escalation strategy to minimize GI effects. Standard practice is to start at 2.5 mg once weekly and increase by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to 5 mg, then 10 mg, and finally 15 mg as tolerated; slower titration is associated with better tolerability, and clinicians should individualize to the highest tolerated dose to maximize glycemic and weight benefits [^97a756d6] [^5dc3eaf8].

> But wait, what about guideline positioning and real-world applicability. The ADA/EASD consensus recognizes tirzepatide as having very high glycemic efficacy and robust weight loss, and AACE notes its superiority versus basal insulin and GLP-1 RAs in multiple trials; while some primary care guidelines remain cautious pending longer-term outcomes, the comparative data in basal insulin–treated patients support tirzepatide as a preferred intensification option when weight loss and hypoglycemia avoidance are priorities [^907a7cb0] [^267bc9f5].

> I should double-check practical implementation details. When adding tirzepatide to basal insulin, consider reducing the basal dose by about 20% if HbA1c is 8.0% or less to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, then titrate basal insulin to fasting glucose targets while advancing tirzepatide per the 2.5 mg every 4-week schedule; monitor for GI intolerance, hydration, and gallstone risk, and reassess glycemic control, weight, and insulin requirements at 4- to 6-week intervals initially [^565093b6] [^97a756d6].

> Let me synthesize the comparative picture. Versus adding prandial insulin, tirzepatide achieves greater HbA1c reduction, substantially more weight loss, far less hypoglycemia, improved quality of life, and reduced insulin burden, with a tolerability profile that is manageable with slow titration; these advantages are most compelling in patients with obesity, high hypoglycemia risk, or those prioritizing regimen simplicity [^1d7988fc] [^842e8fd6].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the clinical recommendation. For adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin, adding once-weekly tirzepatide is a superior alternative to adding prandial insulin lispro, delivering better glycemic control, significant weight loss, and less hypoglycemia while often allowing insulin dose reduction or discontinuation; implement with slow dose escalation and appropriate basal insulin adjustment, and monitor closely for GI effects and glycemic response [^1d7988fc] [^565093b6] [^97a756d6].

Tirzepatide added to basal insulin is **superior to prandial insulin** for glycemic control and weight loss, with less hypoglycemia and improved quality of life [^1d7988fc] [^842e8fd6]. In SURPASS-6, tirzepatide reduced HbA1c by 2.1% vs 1.1% with insulin lispro, enabled 68% to reach HbA1c < 7% vs 36% with lispro, and produced a 9 kg weight loss vs a 3.2 kg gain with lispro [^1d7988fc] [^dd30cd9f]. Severe hypoglycemia was 10-fold lower with tirzepatide (0.4% vs 4.2%), and many patients reduced or stopped basal insulin [^1d7988fc] [^8000fa28]. Gastrointestinal side effects are common but usually mild and manageable with slow titration [^5dc3eaf8]. Tirzepatide is a **preferred intensification option** for patients on basal insulin who need better glycemic control, weight loss, and lower hypoglycemia risk [^d25bf882].

## Clinical evidence supporting tirzepatide use with basal insulin

### SURPASS-6 trial: tirzepatide vs insulin lispro

- **Design**: Randomized, open-label, phase 3b trial in 1,428 adults with T2DM inadequately controlled on basal insulin ± metformin; 52 weeks.
- **Interventions**: Tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly vs thrice-daily insulin lispro, all with insulin glargine.
- **Primary outcome**: HbA1c change at 52 weeks; tirzepatide reduced HbA1c by 2.1% vs 1.1% with lispro (ETD −0.98%; P < 0.001) [^1d7988fc].
- **Secondary outcomes**: More patients achieved HbA1c < 7% with tirzepatide (68% vs 36%; OR 4.2) and lost more weight (−9.0 kg vs +3.2 kg; ETD −12.2 kg) [^1d7988fc].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Severe hypoglycemia was 10-fold lower with tirzepatide (0.4% vs 4.2%) [^1d7988fc].
- **Insulin use**: Tirzepatide reduced basal insulin dose by 8–19% and enabled 8–19% to discontinue basal insulin [^8000fa28].

---

### SURPASS-5 trial: tirzepatide with basal insulin

- **Design**: 40-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in 475 patients on insulin glargine ± metformin.
- **Interventions**: Tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly vs placebo, with treat-to-target insulin titration.
- **Results**: HbA1c fell by 2.4%, 2.5%, and 2.5% with tirzepatide vs 0.9% with placebo; insulin dose rose to 59 U/day with placebo but remained stable or fell with tirzepatide [^565093b6].

### SURPASS-CN-INS trial: tirzepatide in China

In a 40-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in China, tirzepatide 10 or 15 mg added to basal insulin reduced HbA1c by 2.39% and 2.37% vs 0.91% with placebo (both P < 0.0001), with predominantly mild gastrointestinal adverse effects [^533209b8].

---

## Glycemic efficacy

Tirzepatide provides **greater HbA1c reduction than prandial insulin** and achieves higher rates of HbA1c < 7% and ≤ 6.5% [^1d7988fc]. It also improves fasting and postprandial glucose, with early effects evident within 2 weeks [^27e77ed2].

---

## Weight loss and metabolic benefits

Tirzepatide produces **substantial, dose-dependent weight loss** (6–12 kg in trials) and improves insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and lipids, including triglycerides and LDL cholesterol [^6a4aec2f] [^57ff75fc].

---

## Hypoglycemia risk

Tirzepatide has a **lower hypoglycemia risk than insulin** because its glucose-dependent insulin secretion is activated only when glucose is elevated, and severe hypoglycemia is less frequent than with prandial insulin [^1d7988fc] [^bf89f554].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting are common but usually mild to moderate and decrease over time; slow titration mitigates symptoms [^5dc3eaf8].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rates are comparable to insulin and GLP-1 RAs, with no excess pancreatitis or malignancy signals to date [^b2b2d3a2].
- **Gallbladder disease**: Small increased risk, similar to GLP-1 RAs; monitor for symptoms [^97a756d6].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes

Tirzepatide improves **health-related quality of life** versus prandial insulin, likely due to weight loss, fewer injections, and less hypoglycemia [^842e8fd6] [^beff5128].

---

## Practical considerations and clinical guidelines

- **Dosing**: Start 2.5 mg weekly, increase by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to 5, 10, or 15 mg as tolerated [^97a756d6].
- **Basal insulin adjustment**: Reduce basal dose by ~20% when starting tirzepatide if HbA1c ≤ 8.0% to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^565093b6].
- **Monitoring**: Check HbA1c every 3 months and adjust therapy to individual targets [^b31dd19e].
- **Guidelines**: ADA/EASD and AACE endorse tirzepatide as a preferred option for T2DM, including patients on basal insulin who need weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk [^907a7cb0].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Gastrointestinal intolerance**: May limit use; consider slower titration or alternative therapies [^5dc3eaf8].
- **Long-term data**: Cardiovascular and renal outcome data are accumulating; current data show no excess CV risk vs insulin [^e6a64a8e].
- **Cost**: Higher than insulin; consider access and patient preference [^notfound].

---

Tirzepatide added to basal insulin is **superior to prandial insulin** for glycemic control and weight loss, with less hypoglycemia and better quality of life, making it a preferred intensification choice for patients on basal insulin who need improved control, weight reduction, and lower hypoglycemia risk [^1d7988fc] [^842e8fd6].

### Tirzepatide improved health-related quality of life compared with insulin lispro in basal insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control: a randomised controlled phase 3b trial (SURPASS-6) [^842e8fd6]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

T2D is associated with impairment in all aspects of the HRQoL of those affected, and comorbidities, commonly obesity, can have a further adverse impact. Notably, 90% of people with T2D have been classified as living with overweight or obesity, and weight reduction is recognised as an important aspect of T2D management. It is, therefore, important that treatments that can effectively assist people with T2D to achieve glycaemic control and weight reduction are available, as they may result in improved HRQoL. Such options may help people to be more engaged in the recommended patient-centric collaborative approach to T2D management. To help measure patient-perceived benefits of treatment, PROs are increasingly recognised as important and are being integrated into the clinical trial programmes of antihyperglycaemic treatments. In this analysis of the SURPASS-6 trial, tirzepatide treatment was associated with improvements in participant’s HRQoL. This may be, at least in part, related to weight reduction, but other factors may also have a role. For example, it is possible that the convenience of a once-weekly medication, in contrast to a basal-bolus insulin regimen, which is intensive and requires regular blood glucose monitoring and multiple injections, may have contributed to the relative improvement in HRQoL. In fact, a recent examination of patient perspectives of injectable treatments currently available for the treatment of T2D identified several characteristics of these treatments that are most important to patients, namely confidence in delivering the correct dose, ease of administering the correct dose, ease of using the injection device, and dose frequency.

### Tirzepatide vs insulin lispro added to basal insulin in type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS-6 randomized clinical trial [^1d7988fc]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURPASS-6 was published by Julio Rosenstock and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin? In the SURPASS-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-6 study, the population was: 1425 patients (822 female, 603 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin. The key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of T1DM; history of pancreatitis; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; diabetic macular edema; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring immediate treatment; severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness. In the SURPASS-6 study, the interventions were: n=717 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 52 weeks) n=708 insulin lispro (prandial dose of 100 IU/mL TID for 52 weeks). In the SURPASS-6 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 52 (2.11% vs. 1.13%; AD 0.98%, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17). In the SURPASS-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving HbA1c target < 7.0% at week 52 (68% vs. 36%; OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 5.5) Significant increase in reduction in body weight at week 52 (9 kg vs. -3.2 kg; AD 12.2 kg, 95% CI 10.9 to 13.4). In the SURPASS-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ≥ 1 serious adverse event, death. significant difference in severe hypoglycemia (0.4% vs. 4.2%). In the SURPASS-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin, tirzepatide was superior to insulin lispro with respect to reduction in HbA1c at week 52.

### Once-weekly tirzepatide versus once-daily basal insulin in managing type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^00c86165]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

No meta-analysis has been published comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide vs once-daily basal insulins in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs. This meta-analysis was conducted to address this knowledge gap.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials involving subjects with T2D inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs and receiving tirzepatide in intervention arm and basal insulins in control arm as add-on therapy were searched throughout the electronic databases. The primary outcome assessed was the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving 4339 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared to basal insulins, tirzepatide arms achieved greater reductions from the baseline in HbA1c (tirzepatide 5 mg: mean difference (MD) -0.89% [95% CI: -1.23, -0.54]; tirzepatide 10 mg: MD -1.11% [95% CI: -1.42, -0.79]; and tirzepatide 15 mg: MD -1.23% [95% CI: -1.48, -0.97]; P < .00001 for all). Additionally, the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c levels below 7.0%, 6.5%, and 5.7% were significantly greater in the tirzepatide groups than in the basal insulin group. Greater body weight and blood pressure reductions were observed with tirzepatide than with basal insulins. Moreover, tirzepatide had a more favorable impact on lipid profile. Hypoglycemia was less frequent with tirzepatide. Gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with tirzepatide (all doses) than basal insulin, although serious AEs were comparable between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide outperformed basal insulins in controlling blood glucose, body weight, blood pressure, and lipids in subjects with T2D and is generally well-tolerated except for its higher gastrointestinal AEs.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes in China (SURPASS-CN-INS): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^533209b8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Data on tirzepatide added to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes in China are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to basal insulin in this population.

Methods

SURPASS-CN-INS was a 40-week, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done in 26 hospitals in China. Participants aged 18 years or older with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving once-daily insulin glargine alone or in combination with metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to once-weekly tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or placebo by subcutaneous injection for 40 weeks, stratified by HbA 1c (≤8·0% [≤64 mmol/mol] vs >8·0% [>64 mmol/mol]) and SGLT2 inhibitor use using an interactive web response system. Treatment assignment was masked from the study sponsor, investigators, site staff, clinical monitors, and patients until the end of the study by using identical packaging and injection devices for tirzepatide and placebo. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 40 for tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg versus placebo in all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of treatment, excluding those who were enrolled inadvertently. Safety was evaluated in all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05691712, and has been completed.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2023, and July 1, 2024, 331 patients were screened, of whom 257 were randomly assigned to and received tirzepatide 5 mg (n=65), 10 mg (n=65), or 15 mg (n=63), or placebo (n=64). One patient in the tirzepatide 5 mg group and one in the placebo group were inadvertently enrolled and excluded from efficacy analyses. The mean age of 255 patients in the efficacy analysis set was 56·7 years (SD 10·5). 98 (38%) patients were female, and 157 (62%) patients were male. Patients receiving tirzepatide had greater reductions in HbA 1c from baseline at week 40 than those receiving placebo (-2·39% [SE 0·13] in the 10 mg group, and -2·37% [0·13] in the 15 mg group vs -0·91% [0·12] in the placebo group; difference vs placebo -1·48% [97·5% CI -1·87 to -1·08; p<0·0001] for the 10 mg group and -1·45% [-1·85 to -1·06; p<0·0001] for the 15 mg group). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving tirzepatide were diarrhoea (17 [26%; 95% CI 17-38] of 65 in the tirzepatide 5 mg group, 24 [37%; 26-49] of 65 in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, and 23 [37%; 26-49] of 63 in the tirzepatide 15 mg group vs five [8%; 3-17] of 64 in the placebo group), decreased appetite (19 [29%; 20-41], 16 [25%; 16-36], and 20 [32%; 22-44] vs none [0%; 0-6]), and upper respiratory tract infection (13 [20%; 12-31], 11 [17%; 10-28], and 11 [18%; 10-29] vs ten [16%; 9-26]). Gastrointestinal adverse events commonly reported in other trials in the SURPASS programme, including diarrhoea, nausea (three [5%; 95% CI 2-13] in the tirzepatide 5 mg group, seven [11%; 5-21] in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, and seven [11%; 5-21] in the tirzepatide 15 mg group vs two [3%; 1-11] in the placebo group), and vomiting (four [6%; 2-15], six [9%; 4-19], and four [6%; 3-15] vs none [0%; 0-6]), were predominantly mild or moderate in severity.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide added to basal insulin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated, providing evidence to support its potential therapeutic use in patients with type 2 diabetes in China.

### Tirzepatide vs insulin lispro added to basal insulin in type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS-6 randomized clinical trial [^dd30cd9f]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tirzepatide is a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Efficacy and safety of adding tirzepatide vs prandial insulin to treatment in patients with inadequate glycemic control with basal insulin have not been described.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide vs insulin lispro as an adjunctive therapy to insulin glargine.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label, phase 3b clinical trial was conducted at 135 sites in 15 countries (participants enrolled from October 19, 2020, to November 1, 2022) in 1428 adults with type 2 diabetes taking basal insulin.

Interventions

Participants were randomized (in a 1:1:1:3 ratio) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of tirzepatide (5 mg [n=243], 10 mg [n=238], or 15 mg [n=236]) or prandial thrice-daily insulin lispro (n=708).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included noninferiority of tirzepatide (pooled cohort) vs insulin lispro, both in addition to insulin glargine, in HbA1c change from baseline at week 52 (noninferiority margin, 0.3%). Key secondary end points included change in body weight and percentage of participants achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target of less than 7.0%.

Results

Among 1428 randomized participants (824 [57.7%] women; mean [SD] age, 58.8 [9.7] years; mean [SD] HbA1c, 8.8% [1.0%]), 1304 (91.3%) completed the trial. At week 52, estimated mean change from baseline in HbA1c with tirzepatide (pooled cohort) was -2.1% vs -1.1% with insulin lispro, resulting in mean HbA1c levels of 6.7% vs 7.7% (estimated treatment difference, -0.98% [95% CI, -1.17% to -0.79%]; P<.001); results met noninferiority criteria and statistical superiority was achieved. Estimated mean change from baseline in body weight was -9.0 kg with tirzepatide and 3.2 kg with insulin lispro (estimated treatment difference, -12.2 kg [95% CI, -13.4 to -10.9]). The percentage of participants reaching HbA1c less than 7.0% was 68% (483 of 716) with tirzepatide and 36% (256 of 708) with insulin lispro (odds ratio, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.2-5.5]). The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea: 14%-26%; diarrhea: 11%-15%; vomiting: 5%-13%). Hypoglycemia event rates (blood glucose level <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia) were 0.4 events per patient-year with tirzepatide (pooled) and 4.4 events per patient-year with insulin lispro.

Conclusions and Relevance

In people with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin, weekly tirzepatide compared with prandial insulin as an additional treatment with insulin glargine demonstrated reductions in HbA1c and body weight with less hypoglycemia.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^98918aa4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic condition marked by hyperglycaemia that requires stepwise addition of multiple glucose-lowering medications as the disease progression. The net result is a viscous cycle of hyperglycaemia leading to continuous deterioration of metabolic function and necessitating insulin therapy in many cases. Obesity is one of the major modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The parallel rising prevalence of obesity and T2D (name "diabesity") present a principal global health challenge with increased risk for overall mortality. In patients with T2D, Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras) improve the regulation of glucose homeostasis, weight-losing, and long-term benefit cardiovascular outcomes, which have been demonstrated to be accompanied by improved micro- and macrovascular risk factors. While real-world evidences of the broad metabolic benefits of GLP-1Ra have emerged, many patients do not achieve their individualised glycemic and body weight (BW) targets with the currently approved incretin, making continuous optimization of these agents an important clinical goal. Individualizing the glycemic and BW targets for diabesity patients is now the guideline-recommended strategy, how therapy could accomplish this is unknown. Moreover, dose dependent gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1Ra limits the efficacy. Therefore, agents possessing GLP-1 pharmacology that can active alternative pathways might expand the therapeutic index for T2D.

### Tirzepatide improved health-related quality of life compared with insulin lispro in basal insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control: a randomised controlled phase 3b trial (SURPASS-6) [^5e4fc8a4]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by insulin resistance and progressive loss of beta cell function. Patients with long-standing inadequately controlled diabetes often require initiation of insulin therapy, usually with basal insulin. Over time, as the disease progresses, intensification of insulin therapy with prandial insulin is often needed to improve glycaemic control. However, weight gain, fear of hypoglycaemia and treatment complexity are recognised barriers to therapy intensification in real-world clinical practice. Furthermore, the greater treatment burden, lower adherence and greater healthcare costs associated with basal-bolus insulin therapy present additional challenges. A number of these factors may contribute to the general lack of positive effect seen with basal-bolus insulin therapy on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measuring overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or health state (Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 [SF-36v2], EQ-5D-5L, World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index and Diabetes Quality of Life).

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^f3d67e8c]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disease characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia. T2DM is the most common form of diabetes and, as of 2017, has affected 462 million individuals worldwide, corresponding to 6.3% of the global population. T2DM is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality, and poor management of T2DM increases the risk of developing a range of comorbidities. In addition, T2DM is associated with considerable global burden, exerting an economic strain on both individuals and within-country healthcare systems. Clinical guidelines acknowledge the importance of obesity management and recommend diet and lifestyle interventions for patients with T2DM who are overweight or have obesity; if needed, diet and lifestyle interventions should be supplemented with an antihyperglycaemic agent with proven weight loss benefits. Medications that address the incretin effect and other defective pathophysiological pathways such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are important tools in the treatment of T2DM. Tirzepatide, a long-acting GIP receptor and GLP-1 RA, is an amino acid sequence including a C20 fatty diacid moiety that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. Tirzepatide selectively binds to both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1, and it has been approved for the treatment of T2DM and chronic weight management.

Clinical Significance of the SURPASS Clinical Trials

Diabetes care has evolved over the last two decades, shifting from a glucocentric approach to multifactorial intervention with the aim of minimising CV morbidity and mortality. International guidelines recommend the choice of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy based not only on the degree of hyperglycaemia but also on the presence or absence of CV disease, renal disease and obesity. GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors have gained popularity due to their clinical efficacy and favourable CV outcomes. Despite these developments, there are still unmet needs for people living with diabetes, especially those with obesity. Tirzepatide has demonstrated greater HbA1c reduction (− 2.4% with 15 mg tirzepatide) and superior weight loss (− 11.3 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg) with comparable adverse effects versus the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide in phase 2 trials. Of note, semaglutide, currently regarded as the most potent GLP-1 RA, demonstrated 1.5–1.8% HbA1c reduction and 4.5–6.5 kg weight reduction. It is not possible to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide with available data from phase 2 trials; however, the SURPASS-2 trial will directly compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus semaglutide with the potential for superiority of tirzepatide, particularly with respect to weight reduction. Since the prevalence of diabesity is increasing, diabetes medications with potent weight loss will be increasingly attractive in modern diabetes care. Amongst available GLP-1 RAs, liraglutide 3.0 mg daily subcutaneous injection (Saxenda®) has approval for chronic weight management in patients with obesity or with a weight-related comorbidity and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 ; however, for the management of T2DM, the approval licence remains at the once daily dose of 1.8 mg. In the SCALE trial which compared liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg versus placebo, there was a small but significant reduction in weight and HbA1c in the liraglutide 3 mg group compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg group. However, the SCALE study was not designed to compare the efficacy of liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg. In the SCALE insulin trial, liraglutide 3 mg was associated with a HbA1c reduction of 1.1% compared to placebo (0.6%). Of interest, a higher dose of dulaglutide for glucose lowering was recently approved by the FDA following the AWARD-11 trial which demonstrated HbA1c reduction of 1.9% and 1.7% and weight reduction of 5 kg and 4.3 kg with dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3 mg QW respectively.

5 CONCLUSION

In the Phase 3 SURPASS‐1‐5 studies, which included >6000 people with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in both HbA1c and body weight when used across the diabetes treatment continuum, from monotherapy to combination with basal insulin. These data were generally representative of a broad spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes in terms of disease duration, comorbidities and complications, similar to clinical practice. In each study, the magnitude of glucose‐lowering efficacy and weight loss with tirzepatide was greater than with comparators, which included semaglutide 1 mg and titrated basal insulin glargine 100 U/ml and insulin degludec. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, and its safety profile appears generally similar to the GLP‐1 receptor agonist class. These findings suggest that tirzepatide may be a useful therapy for many people with type 2 diabetes as part of individualized patient‐centred care.

### Clinical outcomes of tirzepatide or GLP-1 receptor agonists in... [^f9015cdd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 140 308 patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with tirzepatide was associated with significantly lower hazards of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular and kidney events compared with GLP-1 RA. Meaning These findings suggest that treatment with tirzepatide may confer additional clinical benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide RA, was developed in view of the synergistic effect of both receptors in achieving negative energy balance besides facilitating glucose-dependent insulin secretion. 7 Studies have shown tirzepatide’s superiority over semaglutide. in reducing glycated hemoglobin and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. 8 Compared with insulin glargine, tirzepatide.

Hence, we investigated the association of tirzepatide with mortality and adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes compared with GLP-1 RAs in US patients with type 2 diabetes. Both GLP-1 and GIP belong to the incretin system that regulates hormone secretion in response to carbohydrate intake. 32 Although the effect of GIP has been found to be greatly attenuated in patients with type 2 diabetes, 33 subsequent research has shown that islet β-cell sensitivity to GIP may be restored with glycemic control. 34 Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide acts in the central nervous system by blocking nausea and emesis from GLP-1 agonism without affecting satiety or energy intake reduction, 35 thereby improving overall treatment tolerability. -1 agonists in increasing insulin secretion and sensitivity, improving meal tolerance, and suppressing glucagon secretion, 37 with similar suppression of appetite and calorie intake.

38 Additionally, nutrition-independent regulation of the GIP pathway through inflammatory stimuli may stabilize atherosclerosis plaques by inhibiting monocyte and macrophage activation39 and suppressing. Patients treated with tirzepatide added to insulin had less eGFR decline10, 41 and proteinuria progression and fewer composite kidney end points compared with the insulin group. 10 These findings align with studies on selective GLP-1 agonists. 42 Notably, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly compare the association with kidney outcomes between tirzepatide and selective GLP-1 RAs.

AACE 2022 diabetes—tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. A systematic analysis of several completed trials with a total of 6609 participants confirmed dose-dependent superiority on glycemic efficacy at 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly subcutaneous administration, with reduction in body weight versus placebo, GLP-1 RAs, and basal insulin. Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^de46d70d]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide has demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control compared with placebo for managing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and its efficacy has been shown to depend on both GIP and GLP-1 receptor-mediated actions. Several phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for tirzepatide (SURPASS trials) investigated the clinical effectiveness and safety of tirzepatide as a treatment for T2DM [,–]. The SURPASS trials compared three doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) with a range of comparators and background antihyperglycaemic agents. In the SURPASS trials, all three doses of tirzepatide demonstrated superior HbA1c reductions and weight loss in comparison with placebo, a GLP-1 RA, and insulin. A long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, SURPASS-CVOT, is currently ongoing to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in people with T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. While the SURPASS trials provided direct comparative evidence on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus a wide range of comparators, it was not feasible to conduct RCTs versus all relevant comparators in all clinical settings, including all GLP-1 RAs. For this reason, comparative data on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus GLP-1 RAs in basal insulin population is sparse, and consequently, a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach has been employed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus additional standard-of-care treatments. An NMA is a method for comparing multiple treatments at the same time in a single analysis by using direct and indirect evidence within a network of RCTs. NMAs can help in evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different treatments used in clinical practice. The objective of this NMA was to compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM receiving treatment with basal insulin.

Examples of clinical scenarios in which use of tirzepatide could be considered for people with T2D

The future role and position of insulins in the T2D treatment continuum will need to be reconsidered, given incretin-based therapies provide substantial reduction in HbA1c without the potential for weight gain and hypoglycaemia seen with insulins. Tirzepatide may be considered for individuals not at target on basal insulin with the aim of improving glycaemic control, decreasing weight and minimising risk of hypoglycaemia (Table 2, clinical scenario B). Outcomes from SURPASS-6 (tirzepatide vs insulin lispro in people with T2D on insulin glargine ± metformin) will further establish the role of tirzepatide in people currently not at target on basal insulin.

Results from SURPASS-CVOT should help establish the role of tirzepatide in managing people with T2D and CV disease. Furthermore, an ongoing study in people aged 10–18 years with T2D will help establish its safety and efficacy in children and adolescents.

### Use of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: scientific evidence and practical aspects [^3ff53ecd]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel antidiabetic medication a single-molecule, agonist to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors. It is approved in the USA and EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Due to the potential novelty represented by incorporating tirzepatide to clinical practice, we aim to review practical aspects of tirzepatide use in T2DM and the supporting scientific evidence. A group of ten endocrinologists involved as investigators in the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program followed a nominal group technique, a qualitative research methodology designed as a semi-structured group discussion to reach a consensus on the selection of a set of practical aspects. The scientific evidence for tirzepatide has been reviewed with respect to a number of patients' clinical profiles and care goals. Information of interest related to adverse events, special warnings and precautions, and other considerations for tirzepatide use has been included. Finally, information provided to the patients has been summarized. The practical aspects reported herein may be helpful in guiding physicians in the use of tirzepatide and contribute to optimizing the management of T2DM.

1.3.3 Insulin use in‐3, ‐4 and ‐5

In SURPASS‐3 and ‐4, the basal insulin comparators were titrated using well‐established treat‐to‐target algorithms to reach a prespecified fasting blood glucose value.The HbA1c change from baseline results in the insulin arms using this treat‐to‐target algorithm were comparable with those disclosed in Phase 3 trials.The mean daily use at Week 52 was 48.8 U for insulin degludec and 43.5 U for insulin glargine 100 U/ml. In SURPASS‐5, background daily insulin glargine 100 U/ml (mean baseline: 0.4 U/kg/day) could be adjusted to maintain a target fasting blood glucose using self‐monitored blood glucose of <100 mg/dl. Whereas participants taking insulin glargine alone had an increase of 25.1 U (75%) from baseline at Week 40, participants taking tirzepatide required significantly less insulin [4.4 to −3.8 U (13% to −11%)].Of note, participants could lower insulin use but, per protocol, could not discontinue insulin therapy.

NMA Procedures

The NMA was reported in accordance with the PRISMA-NMA, which is an extension statement for reporting systematic reviews incorporating NMAs of healthcare interventions.

Inclusion criteria for studies in the NMA included trials with 100% of patients who received basal insulin background therapy with a titration scheme comparable to SURPASS-5 (Table 1). Studies of patients without basal insulin and patients who received other insulins (e.g. bolus insulin) or a combination of basal insulin and other insulins were excluded.

a FBG is the median of the last 3 SMBG values

b Decrease insulin dose by 1–2 IU or 2–4 IU based on hypoglycaemic episodes or their severity

c No insulin dose change is needed if only 1 hypoglycaemic episode with SMBG values between 54 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL was recorded

Multiple efficacy and safety outcomes were identified in the SLR and extracted from the studies for inclusion in this NMA. It is anticipated that tirzepatide will be used as an alternative treatment to current GLP-1 RAs in future clinical practice. The reference treatment in the NMA was placebo and the results are presented as treatment relative to tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg. A feasibility assessment was conducted to assess the quality of the studies and to ensure that the study designs, populations, treatments, outcomes, and timepoints were aligned to provide robust analysis and clinically meaningful results.

Efficacy Outcomes

All trials identified in the SLR were examined for data on primary efficacy outcomes, including change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight and the proportion of patients with T2DM achieving HbA1c < 7.0% or ≤ 6.5%). Secondary efficacy outcomes included the proportion of patients with T2DM reaching weight loss of ≥ 5% and change from baseline in low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure.

Another phase 2 clinical trial with similar objectives was designed to assess three dose-titration regimens of tirzepatide in people with T2DM who received lifestyle intervention with or without metformin therapy. The three dose regimens were (1) the 12 mg group, (n = 29) [4 mg for 4 weeks, 8 mg for 4 weeks and 12 mg for 4 weeks]; (2) the 15 mg-1 group, (n = 28) [2.5 mg for 2 weeks, 5 mg for 2 weeks, 10 mg for 4 weeks and 15 mg for 4 weeks]; and (3) the 15 mg-2 group, (n = 28) [2.5 mg for 4 weeks, 7.5 mg for 4 weeks and 15 mg for 4 weeks]. After 12 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight were observed in all three treatment regimens, compared to placebo. Mean HbA1c changes from baseline ranged from − 1.7% to − 2.0% and mean body weight changes ranged from − 5.3 kg to − 5.7 kg in the tirzepatide groups.

Efficacy of Tirzepatide in Phase 2 Clinical Trials

The phase 2 trial of tirzepatide was a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial in 318 people with T2DM treated with lifestyle intervention alone with or without metformin monotherapy. The trial consisted of two fixed dose (1 mg and 5 mg) tirzepatide groups and two dose-titration groups (5 mg for 2 weeks and 10 mg for the remaining trial period; and 5 mg for 2 weeks, 10 mg for 4 weeks and 15 mg for the remaining trial period). There was also a dulaglutide 1.5 mg group and a placebo group. Baseline characteristics were mean age 57 ± 9 years, 53% male, BMI 32.6 ± 5.9 kg/m 2, duration of diabetes 9 ± 6 years and HbA1c 8.1% ± 1%. Approximately 90% of subjects received metformin at baseline and this continued throughout the trial period. In line with the phase 1 clinical trials, the reduction in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose with tirzepatide was dose dependent (HbA1c reduction from baseline of 8% by 0.7%, 1.6%, 2.0% and 2.4% with 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide doses, respectively). The 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide doses demonstrated a greater reduction in HbA1c at 26 weeks, compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. The proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of < 7.0% and < 6.5% were higher in all tirzepatide groups except 1 mg dose (90% and 82% achieved HbA1c of < 7% and < 6.5%, respectively, in the tirzepatide 10 mg group while 52% and 39% achieved HabA1c of < 7% and < 6.5%, respectively, in the dulaglutide group. Tirzepatide also resulted in significant weight loss during the trial period. Mean weight change from baseline was − 0.9 kg, − 4.8 kg, − 8.7 kg and − 11.3 kg in 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide groups compared to − 0.4 kg for placebo and − 2.7 kg for dulaglutide. The proportion of patients who achieved > 5%, > 10% and > 15% weight loss was 71%, 39% and 25%, respectively, in the 10 mg tirzepatide group; 62%, 38% and 22%, respectively, in the 15 mg tirzepatide group; 22% and 9% of the dulaglutide group achieved weight reduction of > 5% and > 10% respectively.

14.4 MOUNJARO Use in Combination with Basal Insulin with or without Metformin in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

SURPASS-5 (NCT04039503) was a 40-week double-blind trial that randomized 475 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on insulin glargine 100 units/mL, with or without metformin, to MOUNJARO 5 mg, MOUNJARO 10 mg, MOUNJARO 15 mg once weekly, or placebo. The dose of background insulin glargine was adjusted using a treat-to-target algorithm based on self-measured fasting blood glucose values, targeting <100 mg/dL.

Patients had a mean age of 61 years, and 56% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 13.3 years, and the mean baseline BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 80% were White, 1% were Black or African American, and 18% were Asian; 5% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

The mean dose of insulin glargine at baseline was 34, 32, 35, and 33 units/day for patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. At randomization, the initial insulin glargine dose in patients with HbA1c ≤8.0% was reduced by 20%. At week 40, mean dose of insulin glargine was 38, 36, 29, and 59 units/day for patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and placebo, respectively.

Treatment with MOUNJARO 5 mg once weekly, 10 mg once weekly and 15 mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo (see Table 7).

### Tirzepatide: a novel, first-in-class, dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonist [^2ff5721f]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and discuss its potential role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide is a novel once-weekly dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been studied in the SURPASS clinical trials in doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. Tirzepatide phase III clinical trials, SURPASS-1 through SURPASS-5, demonstrate that this medication is safe and effective in treating type 2 diabetes both with and without a variety of background medications versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine in different patient populations. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, with a relatively low withdrawal rate in the active treatment arms. It seems likely that tirzepatide will be recommended as a preferred option in the American Diabetes Association treatment algorithm for high glucose lowering effects in patients with a compelling need for low hypoglycemia risk and weight loss. However, the positioning of tirzepatide in the treatment algorithm will ultimately be dependent on the results of the cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) or other outcome-based trials. Tirzepatide is effective for treating type 2 diabetes by lowering glycated hemoglobin and contributing to significant weight loss.

Overview of the SURPASS Clinical Trials

The SURPASS clinical trial programme aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as a treatment to improve glycaemic control in people with T2DM (Table 3). The SURPASS phase 3 clinical trials include six global, two Japanese and one Asia–Pacific studies. These trials include anti-hyperglycaemic therapy-naïve patients (patients treated with diet and lifestyle alone) as well as patients on various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents (metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, SGLT2 inhibitor and/or insulin). Some studies are placebo-controlled, and others have active comparators, such as GLP-1 RAs (dulaglutide and semaglutide), long-acting insulin analogues (glargine and degludec) or short-acting insulin analogue (lispro). The SURPASS trials are designed to assess once weekly tirzepatide doses of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg. Based on the results of the phase 2 trials, a dose-escalation algorithm is used in the phase 3 trials as follows: starting dose at 2.5 mg weekly for initial 4 weeks, then the dose increment of 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg is reached. Therefore, it takes 4 weeks to reach the 5 mg dose, 12 weeks for the 10 mg dose and 20 weeks for the 15 mg dose. The primary endpoint for each of the studies (except SURPASS J-combo) is change in HbA1c from baseline. The primary endpoint of the SURPASS J combo is the number of participants with more than one severe adverse event.

### Tirzepatide, the newest medication for type 2 diabetes: a review of the literature and implications for clinical practice [^0c0dd5eb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through September 7, 2022, using the keyword "tirzepatide."

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with available results were included.

Data Synthesis

Seven published phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trials investigated efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Studies included adults with uncontrolled T2DM and body mass index above 23 or 25 kg/m 2 . Hemoglobin A1c reduction from baseline was greater with tirzepatide across all studies with absolute reductions up to 3.02% and relative reductions ranging 0.44% (vs semaglutide) to 2.11% (vs placebo). Weight loss was significant. Incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (AE) was similar to semaglutide, and major cardiovascular events was similar to insulin glargine.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Studies demonstrated greater A1c lowering and weight reduction versus placebo and active comparators with AE similar to semaglutide, suggesting tirzepatide will be a valuable addition to the growing list of antidiabetic medications. Although tirzepatide's effects on major cardiovascular events was not increased when compared with insulin glargine, further evidence is needed to assess long-term implications on cardiovascular outcomes compared with agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide has the potential to significantly impact the clinical management of T2DM, and results of ongoing clinical trials will help to fully determine its place in therapy.

### Tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk (SURPASS-4): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^e6a64a8e]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety, with a special focus on cardiovascular safety, of the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering medications.

Methods

This open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 study was done in 187 sites in 14 countries on five continents. Eligible participants, aged 18 years or older, had type 2 diabetes treated with any combination of metformin, sulfonylurea, or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) of 7·5-10·5% (58-91 mmol/mol), body-mass index of 25 kg/m 2 or greater, and established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular events. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:3) via an interactive web-response system to subcutaneous injection of either once-per-week tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or glargine (100 U/mL), titrated to reach fasting blood glucose of less than 100 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority (0·3% non-inferiority boundary) of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus glargine in HbA 1c change from baseline to 52 weeks. All participants were treated for at least 52 weeks, with treatment continued for a maximum of 104 weeks or until study completion to collect and adjudicate major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Safety measures were assessed over the full study period. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03730662.

Findings

Patients were recruited between Nov 20, 2018, and Dec 30, 2019. 3045 participants were screened, with 2002 participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide or glargine. 1995 received at least one dose of tirzepatide 5 mg (n=329, 17%), 10 mg (n=328, 16%), or 15 mg (n=338, 17%), or glargine (n=1000, 50%), and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At 52 weeks, mean HbA 1c changes with tirzepatide were -2·43% (SD 0·05) with 10 mg and -2·58% (0·05) with 15 mg, versus -1·44% (0·03) with glargine. The estimated treatment difference versus glargine was -0·99% (multiplicity adjusted 97·5% CI -1·13 to -0·86) for tirzepatide 10 mg and -1·14% (-1·28 to -1·00) for 15 mg, and the non-inferiority margin of 0·3% was met for both doses. Nausea (12-23%), diarrhoea (13-22%), decreased appetite (9-11%), and vomiting (5-9%) were more frequent with tirzepatide than glargine (nausea 2%, diarrhoea 4%, decreased appetite <1%, and vomiting 2%, respectively); most cases were mild to moderate and occurred during the dose-escalation phase. The percentage of participants with hypoglycaemia (glucose <54 mg/dL or severe) was lower with tirzepatide (6-9%) versus glargine (19%), particularly in participants not on sulfonylureas (tirzepatide 1-3% vs glargine 16%). Adjudicated MACE-4 events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina) occurred in 109 participants and were not increased on tirzepatide compared with glargine (hazard ratio 0·74, 95% CI 0·51-1·08). 60 deaths (n=25 [3%] tirzepatide; n=35 [4%] glargine) occurred during the study.

Interpretation

In people with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide, compared with glargine, demonstrated greater and clinically meaningful HbA 1c reduction with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia at week 52. Tirzepatide treatment was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^2290e76f]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, is a new incretin-based therapy for type 2 diabetes. The degree of HbA1c reduction and weight reduction observed in pre-clinical, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials has not previously been observed in diabetes clinical trials. The comprehensive phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial programme will confirm comparable efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide in the management of T2DM diabetes. The SURPASS trials will also provide insight into understanding of incretin hormones, particularly the role of GIP in energy metabolism. The SURPASS-1 trial is due to be completed in October 2020 and results are eagerly awaited.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^633446ca]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Treatment with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) addresses multiple pathophysiological abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, providing an important therapeutic option for patients with this disease. GLP‐1 RAs improve glucose‐dependent insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion, and decrease the rate of gastric emptying. 1, 2, 3 They are also associated with a reduction in appetite with consequent weight loss. 1, 2, 3 These agents are associated with dose‐limiting side effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 4, 5 and efforts have been made to improve efficacy and tolerability by investigating dose‐escalation regimens that allow attainment of higher doses, which are associated with greater efficacy, while limiting side effects. It has been reported that a slow escalation in dose can limit side effects while increasing the therapeutic utility of GLP‐1 RAs. 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition to the need to improve the tolerability of GLP‐1RAs, further improvement in their efficacy is of importance because not all patients treated with GLP‐1 RAs reach their glycaemic target and/or body weight reduction goals with currently available agents. 10

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-PEDS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^bbb21626]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current treatment options for youth-onset type 2 diabetes are limited and have demonstrated lower glycaemic efficacy than those for adult-onset type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with placebo in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (39 sites), multinational (eight countries) trial over 30 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for 22 weeks in which all participants received tirzepatide. Participants aged 10 to <18 years with youth-onset type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and/or basal insulin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo administered by subcutaneous injection with a single-dose pen. Randomisation was stratified by age group (≤14 years or >14 years) and antihyperglycaemic medication use (metformin, basal insulin, or both). All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment during the 30-week double-blind period. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) from baseline to week 30. Data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug were used to analyse efficacy and safety. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05260021).

Findings

Between April 12, 2022, and Dec 27, 2023, 146 participants were screened, of whom 99 (60 [61%] female, 39 [39%] male; mean age 14·7 years [SD 1·8]; mean baseline HbA 1c 8·04% [1·23]) were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg (n=32), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=33), or placebo (n=34). At week 30, tirzepatide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA 1c , with a mean reduction of 2·23% in the pooled tirzepatide group versus an increase of 0·05% in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference -2·28%; 95% CI -2·87 to -1·69; p<0·0001). Glycaemic efficacy was sustained up to 52 weeks with tirzepatide treatment. Tirzepatide also resulted in significant reductions in BMI of 7·4% and 11·2% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 0·4% in the placebo group at 30 weeks. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide treatment were gastrointestinal, all mild to moderate in severity, and decreased over time. Two (6%) patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg group discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that reported in adults. No deaths were reported during the study period.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control and BMI compared with placebo. These effects were sustained over 1 year.

### Once-weekly tirzepatide versus once-daily insulin degludec as add-on to metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-3): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial [^c4c8182a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries), phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) of 7·0-10·5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m 2 , stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA 1c , and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially given at 2·5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5·0 mmol/L (<90 mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA 1c of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0·3% to establish non-inferiority in HbA 1c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.

Findings

Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n=358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=360), tirzepatide 15 mg (n=359), and insulin degludec (n=360) groups. From a mean baseline HbA 1c of 8·17% (SD 0·91), the reductions in HbA 1c at week 52 were 1·93% (SE 0·05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2·20% (0·05) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2·37% (0·05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1·34% (0·05) for insulin degludec. The non-inferiority margin of 0·3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) versus insulin degludec ranged from -0·59% to -1·04% for tirzepatide (p<0·0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA 1c of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p<0·0001) in all three tirzepatide groups (82%-93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94·3 kg (SD 20·1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (-7·5 kg to -12·9 kg), whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2·3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec ranged from -9·8 kg to -15·2 kg for tirzepatide (p<0·0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12-24%), diarrhoea (15-17%), decreased appetite (6-12%), and vomiting (6-10%) was reported in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (<54 mg/dL or severe) was reported in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment.

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Patients with T2DM Seeking Normoglycemia

In the SURPASS program, up to 23–62% of participants achieved normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%), vs. participants treated with semaglutide 1 mg (20%), insulin degludec (5%), and insulin glargine (3%). Normoglycemia was achieved without clinically significant hypoglycemia in 93.6–100% patients when tirzepatide was not combined with insulin (SURPASS 1–4) and in 85.9% patients when tirzepatide was added to insulin (SURPASS-5). Tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved normoglycemia were slightly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA1c value at baseline.

In addition, tirzepatide enabled participants to maintain a significantly lower blood glucose level throughout the day across all five studies, with a higher proportion of 24-h period spent within a tight target glucose range and a smaller within-day glucose coefficient of variation vs. insulin degludec, indicating lower glycemic variability. Data from a cohort study in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, showed that stringent glycemic control (HbA1c levels < 6.5%) were associated with better outcomes vs. patients with HbA1c between 6.5% to < 7%. Thus, this study is consistent with literature recommending early and intensive treatment to avoid long-term risk of diabetic complications and related mortality.

Patients with T2DM with Very Poor Glycemic Control who are far from Reaching HbA1c Therapeutic Goals

A subgroup analysis involving patients with a HbA1c level > 8.5% showed significant and clinically significant mean reductions in the HbA1c level of − 3.18 up to – 3.46% for tirzepatide at a dose of 15 mg as compared with − 2.58% for semaglutide 1 mg, – 2.07% for insulin degludec, – 1.96% for insulin glargine, – 0.82% for placebo in monotherapy, and – 1.27% for placebo added to insulin glargine. In a post hoc analysis of SURPASS 2, 3, and 4 assessing tirzepatide in participants whose baseline HbA1c was > 9%, between 65 and 86% of patients randomized to tirzepatide achieved HbA1c < 7%. Consistent with these data, the ADA-EASD 2022 consensus has categorized the glycemic effect of tirzepatide as very high.

A similar phase 1 placebo-controlled, randomised study of tirzepatide was conducted in 48 Japanese people with T2DM. The treatment arm of the Japanese study consisted of one fixed (5 mg) dose group and two dose-titration groups (2.5 mg for 2 weeks, 5 mg for 2 weeks and 10 mg for 4 weeks; and 5 mg for 2 weeks, 10 mg for 4 weeks and 15 mg for 2 weeks). The study had a treatment exposure of 8 weeks with a 4-weeks safety follow-up. Baseline characteristics were mean age 57.4 ± 8.8 years, 47% male, BMI 25.4 ± 3.2 kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.0 ± 0.8%. In line with the proof-of-concept study, compared to placebo there was a significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline in all tirzepatide groups (− 1.62%, − 1.78%, − 2.05% in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg tirzepatide respectively). Significant reduction in body weight was also noted in all three tirzepatide groups (weight loss of 1.9 kg, 3.6 kg, 5.1 kg in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg tirzepatide respectively).

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^8c333dbe]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapy is an established treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is recommended early in the treatment algorithm owing to glycaemic efficacy, weight reduction and favourable cardiovascular outcomes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), on the other hand, was thought to have no potential as a glucose-lowering therapy because of observations showing no insulinotropic effect from supraphysiological infusion in people with T2DM. However, emerging evidence has illustrated that co-infusion of GLP-1 and GIP has a synergetic effect, resulting in significantly increased insulin response and glucagonostatic response, compared with separate administration of each hormone. These observations have led to the development of a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as a ‘twincretin’. Tirzepatide is a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. Pre-clinical trials and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials indicate that tirzepatide has potent glucose lowering and weight loss with adverse effects comparable to those of established GLP-1 receptor agonists. The long-term efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide will be investigated in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial programme. In this paper, we will review the pre-clinical and phase 1 and 2 trials for tirzepatide in the management of T2DM and give an overview of the SURPASS clinical trials.

Efficacy of Tirzepatide in Phase 1 Clinical Trials

A phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial was conducted in 53 people with T2DM, comprising five groups: two fixed dose groups (tirzepatide 0.5 mg and 5.0 mg) and two dose-titration groups (tirzepatide 0.5/5/10/10 mg and 0.5/5/10/15 mg) and a placebo group. The study had 4 weeks treatment followed by 4 weeks safety follow-up. Baseline characteristics of study participants were mean age 56.8 ± 6.9 years, 53% male, 77% White, 13% Asian, 8% Black, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.4 ± 0.8% (all values in mean ± SD). After 4 weeks treatment, a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in HbA1c was observed in both titration groups compared to placebo. Fasting glucose and fasting serum insulin were significantly decreased in both titration groups compared to placebo. All tirzepatide treatment doses except 0.5 mg reduced the glucose responses (glucose area under the curve [AUC]) during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to placebo. Similarly, 7-point self-monitoring of blood glucose demonstrated reduction in postprandial glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the HbA1c reduction, a dose-dependent reduction in body weight in tirzepatide groups compared to the placebo group was observed. The 0.5/5/10/10 mg and 0.5/5/10/15 mg groups achieved 2.39 kg and 2.95 kg weight loss respectively.

SURPASS-CVOT is a large phase 3, randomised, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes trial for tirzepatide assessing both non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide against dulaglutide (1.5 mg weekly). The SURPASS-CVOT will include 12,500 participants with T2DM (aged 40 years, HbA1c between 7.5% and 10.5%, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease from 30 countries. In addition to study drug, participants should continue to receive standard medical care for diabetes which include concomitant oral glucose-lowering therapy and/ or various insulin regimens. Participants who have treatment with any GLP-1 RA or pramlintide in 3 months prior to screening visit and who discontinue a GLP-1 RA or pramlintide because of intolerability are excluded from the study. Participants with sever heart failure (NYHA class 4) and those with end-stage renal disease or on dialysis are excluded from the study. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline is one of the stratification factors for randomisation. Tirzepatide is started at 2.5 mg weekly and to be escalated to 15 mg weekly or to the highest maintenance dose tolerated by the study participant. The dose of dulaglutide is initiated and maintained at 1.5 mg weekly. A sham dose escalation of dulaglutide will be employed to maintain the double-blind study design. The primary outcome measure is time to first occurrence of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke (MACE-3). Secondary outcome measures include time to all-cause mortality, time to occurrence of each component of the primary endpoint, time to first occurrence of new or worsening nephropathy and change in body weight, HbA1c, urine albumin to creatinine ratio and lipid profile from baseline. The study is event-driven and is expected to run for approximately 54 months (randomisation up to study completion).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^5d039579]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin and sulfonylureas are commonly used OADs for the management of type 2 diabetes in clinical settings,; metformin was historically used as first‐line treatment.Tirzepatide or insulin is used as an add‐on therapy to OADs for the management of type 2 diabetes.It is crucial to assess the long‐term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite multiple OAD treatments. The primary endpoints of SURPASS‐4 were reported till 52 weeks. Meanwhile, this post‐hoc analysis of the SURPASS‐4 study aims to provide insights into the long‐term efficacy (glycaemic control and body weight changes) and safety of tirzepatide at 104 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of weekly tirzepatide versus weekly insulin in type 2 diabetes: a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^4ea360af]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety profiles of recent innovations in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which include once-weekly formulations such as tirzepatide, a dual glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist, and once-weekly insulin options such as icodec and basal insulin Fc.

Methods

A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases was conducted. The network meta-analysis protocol was registered at OSF registries (https://osf.io/gd67x). The primary outcome of interest was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), with change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, incidence of hypoglycaemia, and treatment discontinuation as secondary outcomes.

Results

Tirzepatide exhibited superior efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels compared with insulin therapies, with the 15-mg dose showing the most significant reduction (mean difference [MD] -1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.49; -1.0). In terms of FPG reduction, tirzepatide 15mg ranked highest (MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.05; -0.34), followed by tirzepatide 10mg and 5mg. Additionally, tirzepatide led to substantial weight loss, with the 15-mg dose exhibiting the most pronounced effect (MD -12.13, 95% CI -13.98; -10.27). However, a higher incidence of adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuation were associated with tirzepatide, particularly at higher doses.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide, particularly at higher doses, demonstrates superior efficacy in lowering HbA1c and reducing hypoglycaemia risk compared with weekly insulin. However, its use is also associated with a higher incidence of AEs and treatment discontinuation.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^fc31e5ae]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Together these trials suggest a ‘lower is better’ approach to managing glycemia, or at least that ‘lower is safe’, with newer medications providing improved outcomes through non‐glycemic mechanisms.,,,,,,,,However, the population in these trials must be considered, that being, without diabetes. While early glycemic control is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with T2D,it is not expected that diabetes can be managed to a point at which outcomes mirror the population without diabetes.Moreover, even prediabetes is associated with adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes.The other major component which must be considered with these trials is that those medications under discussion (i.e. metformin, pioglitazone, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide) do not have an independent risk for hypoglycaemia as noted by their safe use among patients without overt hyperglycemia. Therefore, the use of these medications individually or in combination among patients with or without diabetes may lower HbA1c into the prediabetes or normoglycemia range, though the long‐term outcomes associated with this approach require further study in the context of T2D. Indeed, the landmark trials that established glycemic goals were completed prior to many of these medications being commonly used in clinical practice. However, the addition of basal insulin, as in FRCs, produces a patient risk profile more similar to older studies upon which current glycemic goals are based upon, e.g. HbA1c <~7%, adjusted up or down based on patient‐specific factors.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^0d5d0e41]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide was compared with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with basal insulin using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM treated with insulin and an antihyperglycaemic drug. For the NMA, studies included trials with 100% of patients treated with basal insulin background therapy with a titration scheme comparable to the SURPASS-5 trial. The following data were extracted for efficacy and safety assessment at the primary endpoint of each study: changes from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight and the incidence of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia, and patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. In this study, a comparative analysis of tirzepatide was performed with the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide, exenatide, and lixisenatide in addition to placebo.

Results

A total of six studies were included across the analyses. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed statistically significant, greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight at the primary endpoint versus all GLP-1 RA comparators and placebo. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed a statistically significant, higher likelihood of experiencing nausea compared with those who received placebo or exenatide 2 mg; no statistically significant differences were observed when compared with all other GLP-1 RA comparators. No statistically significant differences were observed in the proportions of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events when tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg were compared with GLP-1 RA comparators, apart from tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus placebo.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight when compared with selected GLP-1 RAs and placebo in patients with T2DM treated with basal insulin. Overall, the safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to that of GLP-1RAs.

### Tirzepatide vs insulin lispro added to basal insulin in type 2 diabetes (...) [^8000fa28]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

across all stages of diabetes treatment. 7-11 Furthermore, 81% to 97% of participants achieved an HbA1c less than 7. 0% and 23% to 62% achieved an HbA1c less than
5. 7%. 7-11 The SURPASS-6 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding tirzepatide to background basal insulin vs adding thrice-daily prandial insulin lispro in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes receiving basal insulin with or without metformin. All tirzepatide doses demonstrated superiority to insulin lispro. Observed changes from baseline in body weight over time with individual tirzepatide doses are presented in eFigure 4B in Supplement 2. Significant increases in mean pulse rate reached up to
4. 5 per minute with tirzepatide and 2. 0 per minute with insulin lispro during the trial, with the difference in mean pulse rate from baseline ranging from
1. 4 to 2. 6 per minute with tirzepatide compared with
1. 0 per minute with insulin lispro at week 52.

Tirzepatide as an add-on to basal insulin treatment at individual and pooled doses resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in mean HbA1c and a higher percentage of participants meeting an HbA1c target of less than
7. 0%, compared with prandial lispro insulin, in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with basal insulin. This glycemic efficacy was associated with weight loss and a lower rate of clinically significant hypoglycemia. The effects of tirzepatide on glycemic control, weight loss, and other cardiometabolic parameters were consistent with other SURPASS trials. 7-11. In the current trial, with an overall mean baseline HbA1c of
8. 8%, the recommended HbA1c target of less than 7. 0% was achieved by 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants. Treatment guidelines recommend simplifying complex treatment regimens, especially when using insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, polypharmacy, and overall burden of disease.

1 Tirzepatide treatment demonstrated reductions in basal insulin use in a dose-dependent manner, with 8% to 19% of participants completely discontinuing basal insulin therapy.

### Tirzepatide outcompetes long-acting insulin in managing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of three phase 3 randomized controlled trials [^57ff75fc]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with those of long-acting or ultra-long-acting insulin for type 2 diabetes. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from the inception to August 20, 2023. All clinical trials or randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of tirzepatide with long-acting or ultra-long-acting insulin for treating type 2 diabetes were included. Three randomized clinical trials, namely SURPASS-3, SURPASS-4, and SURPASS-AP-Combo, with 4339 patients were included. Compared with daily insulin glargine and degludec, once-weekly tirzepatide significantly decreased HbA1c (WMD -1.08%, 95% CI (-1.37, -0.78)), 2h-posprandial blood sugar (BS) (WMD -28.19mg/dL, 95% CI (-44.98, -11.41)), pre-meal BS (WMD -11.86mg/dL, 95% CI (-22.83, -0.9)), body weight (WMD -10.61kg, 95% CI (-13.24, -7.97)), systolic blood pressure (WMD -6.47mmHg, 95% CI (-8.32, -4.61)), diastolic blood pressure (WMD -2.30mmHg, 95% CI (-3.05, -1.55)), total cholesterol (WMD -4.78%, 95% CI (-7.05, -2.50)), triglyceride (WMD -14.49%, 95% CI (-19.55, -9.43)), LDL cholesterol (WMD -5.98%, 95% CI (-9.83, -2.13)), and VLDL cholesterol (WMD -14.18%, 95% CI (-19.03, -9.33)) and increased HDL cholesterol (WMD 7.13%, 95% CI (-9.83, -2.13)), with a lower risk of hypoglycemia defined as BS≤70mg/dL (RR 0.46, 95% CI (0.28, 0.75)). All doses of once-weekly tirzepatide (5mg, 10mg, and 15mg) were superior or non-inferior to insulin. Once-weekly tirzepatide can be a substitution for long-acting insulin in type 2 diabetes with a greater efficacy.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^6ef84f23]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the USA, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2-diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of < 5.7% (which is the upper limit of the normal range indicating normoglycaemia), and 20.7 to 68.4% lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight. Tirzepatide was significantly more effective in reducing HbA 1c and body weight than the selective GLP-1 RA semaglutide (1.0 mg per week), and titrated basal insulin. Adverse events related to tirzepatide were similar to what has been reported for selective GLP-1RA, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, that were more common at higher doses. Cardiovascular events have been adjudicated across the whole study program, and MACE-4 (nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death and hospital admission for angina) events tended to be reduced over up to a 2 year-period, albeit with low numbers of events. For none of the cardiovascular events analysed (MACE-4, or its components) was a hazard ratio > 1.0 vs. pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial program, and the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for MACE were < 1.3, fulfilling conventional definitions of cardiovascular safety. Tirzepatide was found to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory responses to a greater extent than semaglutide, and this was associated with lower prandial insulin and glucagon concentrations. Both drugs caused similar reductions in appetite, although tirzepatide caused greater weight loss. While the clinical effects of tirzepatide have been very encouraging, important questions remain as to the mechanism of action. While GIP reduces food intake and body weight in rodents, these effects have not been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, it remains to be shown that GIPR agonism can improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients who have been noted in previous studies to be unresponsive to GIP. Certainly, the apparent advantage of tirzepatide, a dual incretin agonist, over GLP-1RA will spark renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of GIP in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related co-morbidities.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^d546fc6d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic and complex disease characterised by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.Around 537 million adults aged 20–79 are living with diabetes. This number is expected to increase to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045.Effective management of this condition requires a multifactorial approach that includes both behavioural and pharmacological treatments.Current treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes emphasise the aim to achieve intensive glycaemic control, weight goals, as well as overall quality of life.Despite treatment with various oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs), a significant proportion of participants (45.2% to 93.0%) with type 2 diabetes failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control, such as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and postprandial glucose (PPG), necessitating the need to explore novel therapeutic options in the previous studies.Previous findings showed that >64% of the participants from South Asia, Eurasia, Middle East, and Africa with type 2 diabetes who were treated with OADs alone had inadequate glycaemic control.However, achieving optimal glycaemic control with insulin therapy can be challenging, often requiring dose adjustments that lead to increased risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.Studies conducted in several countries, such as the United States, China, and India, have revealed that a significant number of patients had poor glycaemic control despite being on insulin therapy.

Tirzepatide, a dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, is approved in many countries, including the United States, Europe, and China, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity.,Clinical trials have demonstrated that tirzepatide significantly reduces HbA1c levels and body weight compared to other glucose‐lowering agents, without a clinically significant increase in hypoglycaemic events.,In the Phase III SURPASS‐3 and SURPASS‐4 trials, participants treated with tirzepatide demonstrated substantial reductions in HbA1c levels and substantial weight reduction compared to insulin degludec and glargine, respectively, at 52 weeks.Both trials highlight the potential of tirzepatide as an effective add‐on treatment option to multiple OADs in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^4281bb84]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

As the analysis of interest required patients to be treated with basal insulin therapy ± OADs (third-line diabetes therapy with insulin) as background therapy, a limited number of studies were available to include in the network. Hence, the analysis of tirzepatide with comparators such as dulaglutide (0.75 mg, 3.0 mg, 4.5 mg), subcutaneously/orally administered semaglutide, liraglutide and exenatide (5 μg) were not possible as study designs were not comparable to SURPASS-5.

Additionally, patients were required to have basal insulin titration like that of patients enrolled in SURPASS-5 (i.e. increasing dose during the study following the titration scheme in SURPASS-5) to allow comparison of studies with similar designs.

The inclusion of semaglutide in this NMA would have been important, considering that semaglutide is among the most efficacious GLP-1 RAs and represents the current standard-of-care for T2DM. However, comparisons of tirzepatide with subcutaneously administered semaglutide were not feasible because of the different study design of SUSTAIN 5 ; insulin titration was very different between SUSTAIN 5 (restricted) and SURPASS-5 (free titration to the target). In SUSTAIN 5, basal insulin therapy was maintained at stable or decreasing doses among patients who received placebo (mean basal insulin dose from baseline to endpoint was 37 to 35 IU/day with variations between the several included insulins). In SURPASS-5, basal insulin therapy increased substantially in the placebo arm (mean basal insulin dose from baseline to endpoint, 36 to 64 U/day), leading to clinically significant differences in placebo arm results between SUSTAIN 5 and SURPASS-5 (i.e. HbA1c staying stable in SUSTAIN 5 [mean change from baseline, − 0.1%] and decreasing by 0.86% in SURPASS-5). Weight was also impacted in the placebo arm of SUSTAIN 5 (mean weight change from baseline to week 30, − 1.4 kg) and in SURPASS-5 (mean weight change from baseline to week 40, + 1.6 kg). As such, it was not suitable to use the placebo arm from SUSTAIN 5 as a common comparator in the context of this NMA, and the study was therefore excluded from the analyses. Similarly, a comparison of orally administered semaglutide was not feasible and the PIONEER 8 trial had to be excluded. In PIONEER 8, insulin titration remained stable with a maximum 20% reduction in the total daily dose (week 0–8). Unlike SURPASS-5, which used free titration to the target, titration of the insulin dose in PIONEER 8 could not exceed the prerandomization dose during weeks 8–26. This resulted in an HbA1c at week 26 being similar to baseline levels in patients receiving placebo (mean HbA1c at baseline vs. week 26, 8.2% vs. 8.1%); therefore, this study was excluded from the analyses.

HRQoL and Functionality

A holistic and multifactorial approach in T2DM management, with an overall goal of maintaining HRQoL and avoiding complications is recommended. Tirzepatide may contribute to achieving such therapeutic goals, since across the SURPASS clinical program improvements in multiple domains of HRQoL and functionality were consistently observed.

Time to Achieve Therapeutic Goals and Reassess Targets

The ADA-EASD consensus indicates that the reassessment of individual targets and their achievement at regular intervals is key, recommending proactive care and thus avoiding inertia. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology Consensus Statement recommends attaining the treatment goal “as soon as possible”. Clinicians should continuously evaluate treatment goals at each visit, ideally ≤ 3 monthly intervals, and consider making therapeutic changes to achieve targets more rapidly. In addition, some patients may require medication reduction or discontinuation, as in the case of side effects or ineffectiveness. Facilitating the communication, access to the medical center, and interactions between health care professionals (HCPs) and patients positively impacts treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.

In a clinical trial setting, the median time to reach HbA1c < 7% was 8.1 weeks with tirzepatide 5 mg dose vs. 12 weeks with semaglutide 1 mg; and the median time to reach the weight loss target (≥ 5% weight loss) was 16 weeks with tirzepatide 5 mg dose vs. 24 weeks with semaglutide 1 mg. Those patients that achieved early (at 8 weeks) weight loss of ≥ 5% had a greater substantial reduction in weight at the end of the trial vs. those that did not reach this early weight loss target across all tirzepatide doses (mean bodyweight change from baseline (kg) was – 12.4 (5 mg), – 15.7 (10 mg) and – 18.0 (15 mg) for early weight loss compared to – 5.8 (5 mg), – 8.3 (10 mg) and – 10.4 (15 mg) for non-early weight loss groups). The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.5 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to 5 mg once weekly. If needed, dose increases can be made in 2.5 mg increments after a minimum of 4 weeks on the current dose. The recommended maintenance doses are 5, 10 and 15 mg, with a maximum dose of 15 mg once weekly. This information can be useful to guide treatment titration with tirzepatide and frequency of patient follow-up visits.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus basal insulins in people with type 2 diabetes and different baseline glycemic patterns: post hoc analyses of the SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-4 trials [^a29518a7]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This post hoc analysis assessed change from baseline to week 52 in glycemic parameters for tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg) versus insulin degludec (SURPASS-3 trial) and glargine (SURPASS-4 trial) in people with type 2 diabetes and different baseline glycemic patterns, based on fasting serum glucose (FSG) and postprandial glucose (PPG) values.

Research Design and Methods

Participant subgroups with low FSG/low PPG, low FSG/high PPG, high FSG/low PPG, and high FSG/high PPG were defined according to the median values of these measures.

Results

All tirzepatide doses and basal insulins were associated with decreased HbA1c, FSG, and PPG values from baseline to week 52 in all subgroups (P < 0.05). Within each subgroup, HbA1c and PPG decreases were greater with tirzepatide than insulin (P < 0.05). FSG decreases were generally similar. There were no differential treatment effects by FSG/PPG subgroup.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide was associated with superior glycemic control compared with insulin, irrespective of baseline glycemic pattern.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The availability of FRCs of basal insulin (BI) and GLP‐1RAs offers a simplified option to advance therapy in T2DM to further improve glycaemic control, lower body weight without increasing, even lowering, the risk of hypoglycaemia. The combination of BI and GLP‐1RA also reduces, or may avoid, the need for rapid‐acting insulin at meal‐time,,even in people already on a basal‐bolus insulin regimen,,,and is non‐inferior to BBT.

Interestingly, when the FRCs became available some 10 years ago, the predominant recommendation to advance therapy beyond oral hypoglycaemic agents (OGLA) was to begin with the introduction of BI.Therefore, the introduction of FRCs was a significant innovation, offering the advantages of combining BI and GLP‐1RA in a convenient and simplified manner. However, the more recent introduction of long‐acting GLP‐1RAs and the once‐weekly dual agonist tirzepatide (GLP plus GLP‐1) has changed the therapeutic options, making it now possible to intensify treatment of the GLP‐1RA component relative to BI, as compared with the FRCs.

Given the considerable heterogeneity among people with T2DM and their varying therapeutic needs, the FRCs remain to have an important role today, for example, as the first injectable when advancing therapy is required after failure of OGLA. However, frequent longitudinal monitoring of glycaemic control remains essential to determine whether the person with T2DM should continue on FRC therapy or switch to separate dosing and titration of BI and GLP‐1RA to enrich treatment with BI and/or GLP‐1RA as needed.

Body weight

Similar to the results of HbA1c, a statistical dose-dependent reduction in BW of three tirzepatide dose groups when compared to the placebo group was observed (all P < 0.05, Table 2). Consistently, compared with various anti-hyperglycaemic agents, patients receiving all tirzepatide doses were more efficacious than all comparators with respect to BW loss. Any of the three doses was superior to GLP-1 RAs in achieving significant weight-loss (Table 3). The superiority of tirzepatide with respect to BW control was more effective in the comparison versus insulin (Table 3). Furthermore, our system-review results have showed evidence of a reduction in bodyweight with subjects dosed with all tirzepatide doses compared with all comparators in the all eligible RCTs. Five clinical trials of SURPASS 1–5 in T2DM subjects have shown that Tirzepatide at 5, 10 or 15 mg weekly reduces BW (5.4 to 11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent [–,,].

3.3 Hypoglycaemia

Despite the magnitude of the observed effect of tirzepatide on glycaemia, the incidence of hypoglycaemia, defined as clinically significant [blood glucose <54 mg/dl (<3 mmol/L)] or severe, was low across the SURPASS studies.,,The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower for insulin‐naïve participants assigned to tirzepatide (1%‐2%) compared with insulin degludec (7%) and for tirzepatide (6%‐9%) compared with insulin glargine 100 U/ml (19%).In the high cardiovascular risk population of SURPASS‐4, 145 hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the tirzepatide arms and 492 in the insulin glargine 100 U/ml arm.The incidence appeared to be dependent on concomitant medication use; hypoglycaemia occurred in 10%‐14% of tirzepatide‐treated participants using a sulphonylurea at baseline and 1%‐3% of those who did not use a sulphonylurea. In SURPASS‐5 (in which participants used background insulin) tirzepatide did not increase hypoglycaemia compared with placebo (14%‐19% vs. 13%, respectively).These results suggest that the risk of hypoglycaemia attributable to tirzepatide is low when not combined with an insulin secretagogue or insulin.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^9753fdda]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

An important consideration is that many studies evaluating switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC were conducted before the availability of the dual GLP‐1 RA/GIP agonist, tirzepatide. Given tirzepatide's high glycemic and weight loss efficacy, switching to an FRC in those on tirzepatide may not be beneficial, though it remains speculative in the absence of evidence for this comparison. Therefore, adding basal insulin (if not already initiated) may be warranted in patients already on tirzepatide when attempting to achieve glycemic control.

Another consideration to initiating FRC therapy is that iGlarLixi contains lixisenatide, a short‐acting GLP‐1 RA. Thus, switching to lixisenatide from long‐acting agents, such as weekly dosed injectable semaglutide or dulaglutide, may reduce gastrointestinal side effects as its effects do not last throughout the entire day, thus limiting GLP‐1 receptor activation at meal times farther from the dose. However, the change to lixisenatide may also alter post‐prandial glycemic efficacy since lixisenatide has lower glycemic efficacy compared to those weekly dosed GLP‐1 RAs. It is also important to consider that lixisenatide has lower weight loss efficacy vs. those same GLP‐1 RAs (i.e. injectable semaglutide, dulaglutide) or the dual GLP‐1 RA/GIP combination, tirzepatide. On the other hand, iDegLira contains liraglutide, a true once‐daily GLP‐1 RA (having a longer duration of effect than lixisenatide) providing more stable GLP‐1 receptor stimulation than lixisenatide and may be preferred for those previously on once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs. Liraglutide also has higher glycemic and weight loss efficacy, plus positive cardiovascular outcomes data as compared to lixisenatide. However, a limitation to its use as a FRC is the maximum dose of 1.8 mg once daily, and the inability to titrate the GLP‐1 RA component independent of the basal insulin.

Other Clinical Trials of Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide has also been investigated for the management of obesity in individuals without T2DM. SURMOUNT-1, a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is ongoing and plans to recruit 2400 participants with obesity and comorbidity excluding T2DM (those with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2, or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 and previous diagnosis with at least one of the following comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease). The primary endpoints are change in body weight from baseline and percentage of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss after 72 weeks. SYNERGY-NASH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

4 DISCUSSION

When considering treatment options for type 2 diabetes, in addition to glycaemic effects, factors such as comorbidities, hypoglycaemia risk, effects on body weight, side effects and patient preferences, including frequency of administration, should be considered.In addition to improving glycaemia, the take away from the SURPASS 1‐5 studies showed efficacy of tirzepatide to reduce visceral adiposity, blood pressure, triglycerides, waist circumference, body weight and liver fat content. These improvements were apparent across the diabetes continuum when used as monotherapy in people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and as combination therapy with metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors and/or sulphonylureas or insulin. The head‐to‐head SURPASS‐2, ‐3 and ‐4 trials showed that tirzepatide achieved greater glucose lowering and weight lowering than semaglutide 1 mg, titrated insulin glargine 100 U/ml and titrated insulin degludec.

### Glucometabolic outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1f875a15]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations encouraged a prompt intervention to achieve tailored glycaemic targets, listing these new GLP-1RA-based treatments (tirzepatide, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC, high-dose GLP-1RA) among the strategies with greatest glucose-lowering potential.Tirzepatide and semaglutide are also the most effective drugs for weight management.Existing literature hints at differences among these treatment options,,, however, in the absence of head-to-head trials, it is unclear whether they should be regarded as equally efficacious in obtaining glucometabolic and weight control. This network meta-analysis aims to compare for the first time the effects of tirzepatide, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and high-dose GLP-1RA on HbA1c and other glucose outcomes, as well as on weight, blood pressure and lipids, in randomised controlled trials (RCT) in people with type 2 diabetes, in order to help physicians navigating within the multiple highly efficacious GLP-1RA-based treatment options currently available for clinical use.

Patients with T2DM and Overweight or Obesity

Overweight and obesity are two of the main modifiable T2DM-related risk factors, strongly associated with insulin resistance, one of the key features in the pathogenesis of T2DM, and one of the barriers to achieving good glycemic control.

Participant inclusion criteria across the SURPASS clinical trial program included a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m 2, or ≥ 23 kg/m 2, in addition to stable weight (≤ 5% fluctuation in either direction) for the previous 3 months. The mean baseline body weight ranged from 86 to 95 kg and the mean BMI ranged from 31.9 to 34.2 kg/m 2 across the five studies. Tirzepatide showed clinically meaningful weight reductions with an average weight loss ranging from 6.2 to 12.9 kg. Among those participants who received tirzepatide 15 mg, weight loss of at least 5% was achieved by up to 88% (range, 77–88%), weight loss of at least 10% was achieved by up to 69% (range, 47–69%) while weight loss of at least 15% was achieved by up to 43% (27–43%). Tirzepatide was included in the recent consensus report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) as a drug with very high efficacy in weight reduction.

Weight reduction has been associated with improvement in HbA1c and a decrease in the risk of weight-related complications, with a higher extent of loss related to better outcomes. A body weight reduction of up to 5–10% confers metabolic improvement, whereas a weight loss of ≥ 10% can have disease-modifying effects.

Conclusion

The dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide, for diabetes therapy has opened a new era on personalized glycemia control and weight loss in a safe manner with broad and promising clinical implications. Specifically, we reviewed the multiple functions of GIP/GLP-1RAs in regulating metabolism and energy balance in the context of up-to-date findings in T2DM indicating that dual GIP/GLP-1As therapy produced profound weight loss, glycemic and BFG control, and lipid lowering. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate it is possible to achieve well established, but stringent, individualizing the glycemic and BW targets for diabesity patients in a safe manner. More clinical practices are warranted to further integrate long-term efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness with country-specific cost-utility analysis comparing tirzepatide with various anti-hyperglycaemic agents or independent of this, based on health technology assessments.

Discussion

Tirzepatide, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and high-dose GLP-1RA are all innovative GLP-1RA-based therapeutic strategies listed among those with the highest glucose-lowering efficacy according to various RCT and the current ADA/EASD recommendations. Our network meta-analysis found that tirzepatide 15 mg yielded greater HbA1c and BW lowering efficacy compared to other GLP-1RA-based treatments, without increasing the risk of serious adverse events and hypoglycaemia and with a similar rate of gastrointestinal side effects to high-dose GLP-1RA and GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination. Moreover, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC and tirzepatide 15 mg and 10 mg were superior to the other investigated treatments in terms of FPG lowering, while iGlarLixi appeared as the most efficacious in PPG lowering, followed by GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and tirzepatide 15 mg. No significant differences among these GLP-1RA-based treatments were detected in terms of LDL-c and SBP lowering.

The present network meta-analysis provides results that are largely coherent with existing literature. Indeed, RCT conducted so far demonstrated a dose-dependent and unprecedented benefit in HbA1c lowering with tirzepatide compared not only to placebo but also to basal insulin and semaglutide, attaining normoglycaemia in approximately half of enrolled patients. Also, the paramount role of tirzepatide as the most efficacious treatment strategy for weight loss regardless of baseline BMI is coherent with its outstanding performance in RCT conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes,,,,and non-diabetic obese individuals.The mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of tirzepatide is yet to be fully elucidated. Heise et al. recently found that tirzepatide improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, enhanced insulin secretion and reduced post-meal glucagon levels compared to placebo and semaglutide 1 mg.However, these experiments did not address the relative contribution of weight loss and GIP receptor agonism to the superiority of tirzepatide over the GLP-1RA. The role of GIP receptor agonism remains an unresolved issue in the light of the resistance to GIP effects that was shown in patients with type 2 diabetes.Indeed, sustained >10% weight loss has been associated with a greater likelihood of achieving normoglycaemia,especially in patients with shorter disease duration.

2 EFFICACY

2.1 Glycaemic efficacy

The primary endpoint for all five studies was change from baseline in HbA1c at either 40 or 52 weeks, with a baseline HbA1c of 7.94% to 8.52% (63‐70 mmol/mmol).,,In all five studies, tirzepatide was associated with mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c ranging from −1.87% to −2.59% (−20 to −28 mmol/mol) (Figure 3A). These reductions were dose dependent and significantly greater with tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg than placebo (0.04%, SURPASS‐1), semaglutide 1 mg (−1.86%, SURPASS‐2), insulin degludec (−1.34%, SURPASS‐3), insulin glargine 100 U/ml (−1.44%, SURPASS‐4) and placebo with background insulin (−0.93%, SURPASS‐5). Data from SURPASS‐4 indicate that HbA1c reductions were maintained at 78 and 104 weeks, although participant numbers were smaller at the latter time point, providing evidence for sustained glycaemic control with tirzepatide treatment beyond 1 year.Across the five studies, the magnitude of HbA1c reductions achieved were greatest in SURPASS‐4 and ‐5, probably reflecting higher baseline HbA1c in these studies. In SURPASS‐1, the less pronounced dose‐response could reflect the relatively early course of type 2 diabetes and potentially more β‐cell function in this population, as all three tirzepatide doses led to near‐normoglycaemia at 40 weeks and presumably reaching a floor effect (mean HbA1c of 5.9%‐6.1%; 41‐43 mmol/mol).

Methods

Study Design

SURPASS-1 to -5 Studies

Figure S1 (in the supplementary material) provides a summary of the study design of the five phase 3 SURPASS studies included in these analyses. All were randomised, parallel group, multinational trials of 40 or 52 weeks treatment duration at the primary timepoint that compared the efficacy and safety of once weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg versus placebo or active comparator in adults with T2D. Additional study design details and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been previously reported.

Tirzepatide Versus Placebo

In the double-blind SURPASS-1 and -5 studies, patients were randomised to once weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg or placebo as monotherapy or all with background insulin glargine (titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm) ± metformin, respectively, for 40 weeks.

Tirzepatide Versus Semaglutide

In the open-label SURPASS-2 study, patients were randomised to once weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg (blinded) versus semaglutide 1 mg, all with background metformin (minimum 1500 mg/day) for 40 weeks.

Tirzepatide Versus Insulin Degludec

In the open-label SURPASS-3 study, patients were randomised to once weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg or once daily insulin degludec (titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm), all with metformin ± sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for 52 weeks.

Tirzepatide Versus Insulin Glargine

In the open-label SURPASS-4 study, patients at increased cardiovascular risk on one to three oral glucose-lowering medications (± metformin ± sulfonylurea ± SGLT2 inhibitor) were randomised to once weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg or once daily insulin glargine (titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm) for up to 104 weeks with the primary timepoint at 52 weeks.

Ethical Considerations

The SURPASS-1 to -5 studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocols were approved by ethical review boards and all patients provided written informed consent. This particular article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Recently, unimolecular, multifunctional peptides combining GLP-1Ra with GIP has been considered as a promising therapeutic agent for insight against T2DM, suggested that these two incretins can act on β-cells through distinct metabolic effects synergistically and complementarily. Acting on both GIP and GLP-1 receptors to potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion and improve glucose tolerance is attractive because the combination of these mechanisms is hypothesized that the metabolic action of GIP adds to the established clinical benefits of selective GLP-1 Ras, decreasing energy consumption, improving white adipose tissue health and function, increasing insulin response and glucagonostatic response. Studies have shown that the GIP/GLP-1Ras action did not affect the incretin effects on GIP-stimulated insulin secretion, and strengthened the inherent efficacy and broadened their therapeutic range when both the GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor are activated. We reviewed the multiple functions of GIP/GLP-1RAs in regulating metabolism and energy balance in the contexts of up-to-date findings in T2D indicating that dual GIP/GLP-1As therapy produced profound weight loss, glycemic and BFG control, and lipid improving.

|Titration: increase dosage by 2. 5 mg every four weeks to a maximum dosage of 15 mg once weekly if additional glycemic control is needed| Tirzepatide is labeled for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications. It is the first agonist that targets both glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors. 1 This dual effect is hypothesized to impact glycemic control and weight loss more than GLP-1 receptor agonism alone due in part to the prevalence of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors in adipose tissue and the brain. 2 There is also a small increased risk of gallbladder or biliary diseases that may be associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists; this risk could be dose, duration, or indication dependent. 3 Tirzepatide may have a moderately higher risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse events compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

4 Dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Effectiveness Tirzepatide was studied in five trials at 5-, 10-, and 15-mg doses: as monotherapy, as an add-on to metformin, sulfonylureas, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; and as an add-on to basal insulin. Tirzepatide produced significant reductions in A1C levels compared with placebo at all three doses. 5, 6 Tirzepatide has not been directly compared with semaglutide; however, in patients on stable dosages of metformin, tirzepatide will produce a 2. 0% to
2. 3% reduction in A1C levels from base line, which is 0. 15 to
0. 5 percentage points more than 1 mg of semaglutide. 7 In a 52-week study of 1, 995 patients with type 2 diabetes taking up to three oral hypoglycemic agents and at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine at all three doses.

8 Based on limited research, tirzepatide has not been shown to affect cardiovascular outcomes or reduce overall mortality compared with usual care. 4.

### Challenging clinical perspectives in type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide, a first-in-class twincretin [^aa7528e1]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist ('twincretin')-a single molecule that acts as an agonist at both glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. In the SURPASS clinical trial program in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), tirzepatide was associated with unprecedented reductions in HbA1c, clinically significant weight loss and other metabolic benefits, combined with low rates of hypoglycaemia across a wide range of patient characteristics. The safety and adverse event rate for tirzepatide appears comparable to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Although results from dedicated cardiovascular (CV) and kidney trials are currently not available, information to date suggests that tirzepatide may have CV and kidney benefits in people with T2D. Tirzepatide has been approved for the treatment of T2D in the USA, United Arab Emirates, European Union, Japan and Australia. Here, we review how tirzepatide will fit into the T2D treatment continuum. We also consider future directions with tirzepatide in T2D, including its potential for targeting cardio-renal-metabolic disease in T2D, and discuss how tirzepatide-and other co-agonists in development-may challenge current approaches for management of T2D.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^c2731d90]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0-3; 8mgweeks 4-7; 12mgweeks 8-11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0-1; 5mgweeks 2-3; 10mgweeks 4-7; 15mgweeks 8-11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0-3; 7.5mgweeks 4-7; 15mgweeks 8-11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9kg/m 2 . At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^a2133868]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and under investigation for use in chronic weight management, major adverse cardiovascular events and the management of other conditions, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 3 SURPASS 1-5 clinical trial programme was designed to assess efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneously injected tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), as monotherapy or combination therapy, across a broad spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes. Use of tirzepatide in clinical studies was associated with marked reductions of glycated haemoglobin (-1.87 to -2.59%, -20 to -28mmol/mol) and body weight (-6.2 to -12.9 kg), as well as reductions in parameters commonly associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk such as blood pressure, visceral adiposity and circulating triglycerides. In SUPRASS-2, these reductions were greater than with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia when used without insulin or insulin secretagogues and showed a generally similar safety profile to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Accordingly, evidence from these clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide offers a new opportunity for the effective lowering of glycated haemoglobin and body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Patients with T2DM and Cardiovascular (CV) Risk Factors

The holistic patient-centered approach proposed by the ADA-EASD consensus includes CV risk-factor management and cardiorenal protection, in addition to glycemic and weight management. With regard to the cardiovascular profile of tirzepatide, clinical trials have shown an improvement in CV risk factors including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, high-, very low, and low-density lipoproteins and waist circumference in participants receiving tirzepatide. Improvements in liver fat content and reduced visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volume have been shown with tirzepatide. In the SURPASS 4 trial, which included participants at high CV risk, the hazard ratio for major adverse CV events for tirzepatide treatment compared with glargine was 0.74 (95% CI 0.51–1.08), indicating CV risk was not increased. The effects of tirzepatide on CV events in patients with T2DM and increased CV risk are under study in the ongoing clinical trial SURPASS-CVOT. Based on ADA-EASD consensus, if the primary goal is cardiorenal risk reduction, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease GLP-1 RA or sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) with proven CVD benefit are the recommended treatments. In the case of heart failure or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the preferred options are SGLT2i with HF benefits or evidence of reducing CKD progression, respectively.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^41a62d87]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) was published by Juan P Frías and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM? In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the population was: 939 patients (509 female, 430 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; history of pancreatitis; history of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy warranting urgent treatment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic maculopathy. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n=470 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 40 weeks) n=469 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 1 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 40 weeks). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40 (2.01% vs. 1.86%; ARD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 40 (7.6 kg vs. 5.7 kg; ARD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 7.0% (82% vs. 79%; AD 3%, 95% CI -0.01 to 6.01) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 5.7% (27% vs. 19%; AD 8%, 95% CI 3.25 to 12.75). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypoglycemia, ≥ 1 adverse event. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^4950f468]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Some SURPASS clinical trials include SGLT2 inhibitors as concomitant therapy (e.g. SURPASS-3 and -4). SGLT2 inhibitors have a favourable effect on weight and CVD outcomes. It would be interesting to see the combined effect of tirzepatide and SGLT2 inhibitors on efficacy and CVD outcomes. Of interest, the combined use of once weekly exenatide and dapagliflozin resulted in superior HbA1c reduction and greater weight loss compared to the exenatide group and the dapagliflozin group. Therefore, one can argue that tirzepatide might not be solely responsible for favourable results. None of the SURPASS trials are designed to compare tirzepatide against SGLT2 inhibitors. Further study comparing tirzepatide against SGLT2 inhibitors would be of use in clinical decision-making. Since the 2008 publication of FDA guidance on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy, medications for diabetes should not only be efficacious in reduction in HbA1c but should also have favourable CV outcomes (at least no negative CV impact). The SURPASS-CVOT trial will provide long-term data on the CV safety as well as efficacy of tirzepatide.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^27e77ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In SURPASS‐2, a composite endpoint assessing the proportion of participants who achieved HbA1c ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without clinically significant (<54 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycaemia and with ≥10% weight loss was met by 32%‐60% of participants who received tirzepatide compared with 22% who received semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting serum glucose (FSG) was significantly reduced by all tirzepatide doses in SURPASS‐1, ‐2 and ‐5 at either 40 or 52 weeks compared with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg and placebo with background insulin, respectively.FSG levels at endpoint did not differ from insulin degludec in the 10‐ and 15‐mg groups in SURPASS‐3 and in SURPASS‐4 did not differ from insulin glargine 100 U/ml in the 5‐ and 10‐mg groups but were significantly lower in the 15‐mg group (Figure S1). In SURPASS‐3 and ‐4, significant reductions in FSG compared with baseline were apparent as early as 2 weeks (the earliest measurement) after treatment initiation when all participants received 2.5 mg.Across the two studies and three dose groups, the magnitude of this change at 2 weeks was −30.3 to −34.0 mg/dl (−18% to −20%). In a small Phase 1 study, 24 h following treatment with a 2.5 mg initiating dose of tirzepatide, there was a non‐statistically significant (vs. placebo) decrease from baseline of –19 mg/dl in FSG. However, on Day 8 (pre‐dose) a statistically significant (vs. placebo) reduction of −39 mg/dl occurred, indicating early glucose‐lowering potential following tirzepatide initiation.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^58978724]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Although tirzepatide has demonstrated benefits in terms of lower risk of hypoglycaemia and weight reduction compared to insulin and sulfonylureas, it may not be the immediate combination choice for patients inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylureas who do not exhibit poor glycaemic control. Especially for individuals with existing or potential atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease, certain glucose‐lowering agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP‐1 receptor agonists with proven cardiorenal benefits can be considered as an add‐on therapy in clinical decision‐making. Furthermore, the present analysis used data from the SURPASS‐4 trial, wherein insulin glargine served as the comparator to explore the cardiovascular safety.

Considering the mechanism of action and therapeutic landscape, a GLP‐1 receptor agonist administered at an optimal dose would have served as a more clinically relevant comparator. This is being addressed in the SURPASS‐CVOT trial,the first active‐controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) evaluating a glucose‐lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The trial is designed to demonstrate cardiovascular safety of tirzepatide by establishing non‐inferiority to dulaglutide, a GLP‐1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefit.The high proportion of participants treated with SGLT2‐inhibitors at baseline, the large sample and longer study duration are expected to provide insights on the application of incretin‐based medications in mitigating the cardiovascular complications in T2D.

Coskun et al. reported greater weight reduction in obese mice due to the synergistic agonism of the GIP and GLP‐1 receptors compared to the selective GLP‐1 receptor agonism.The mechanism for weight reduction was hypothesised as the synergistic effect of the GIP and GLP‐1 receptors of tirzepatide on modulating energy balance.In GIP receptor knockout mice, tirzepatide demonstrated glycaemic control comparable to that of semaglutide; whereas, in GLP‐1 receptor knockout mice, its glycaemic efficacy mirrored that of a GIP analogue. These findings suggest that tirzepatide exhibited glucose‐lowering activity in the absence of either receptor, underscoring the potential contribution of its dual agonism.To conclusively determine the role of GIP receptor agonism in the efficacy of tirzepatide, a head‐to‐head comparison between tirzepatide and a GLP‐1‐RA with similar GLP‐1 receptor agonistic activity but without GIP receptor agonism would be insightful.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The effectiveness of MOUNJARO as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus was established in five trials. In these trials, MOUNJARO was studied as monotherapy (SURPASS-1); as an add-on to metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) (SURPASS-2, -3, and -4); and in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin (SURPASS-5). In these trials, MOUNJARO (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg given subcutaneously once weekly) was compared with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and/or insulin glargine.

In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with MOUNJARO produced a statistically significant reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to placebo. The effectiveness of MOUNJARO was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, or by baseline BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration, or renal function.

14.2 Monotherapy Use of MOUNJARO in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

SURPASS-1 (NCT03954834) was a 40-week double-blind trial that randomized 478 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise to MOUNJARO 5 mg, MOUNJARO 10 mg, MOUNJARO 15 mg, or placebo once weekly.

Patients had a mean age of 54 years, and 52% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 4.7 years, and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m2. Overall, 36% were White, 35% were Asian, 25% were American Indians/Alaska Natives, and 5% were Black or African American; 43% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Monotherapy with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo (see Table 3).

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6b4621f2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 are the main incretin hormones, and be responsible for the insulinotropic incretin effect. The addition of a GIP agonist to a GLP-1agonist has been hypothesized to significantly potentiate the weight-losing and glycemia control effect, which might offer a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The current meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence of primary efficacy and safety outcomes through clinically randomized controlled trials to evaluate integrated potency and signaling properties.

Method

We conducted comprehensive literature searches in Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed for relevant literatures investigating the efficacy and/or safety of Tirzepatide published in the English as of May 30, 2023 was retrieved. We synthesized results using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95 CIs) for continuous outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) along with 95 Cis for dichotomous outcomes. All analyses were done using Revman version 5.3, STATA version 15.1 and the statistical package 'meta'.

Results

Participants treated with weekly Tirzepatide achieved HbA1c and body weight target values significantly lower than any other comparator without clinically significant increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious and all-cause fatal adverse events. However, gastrointestinal adverse events and decreased appetite events were reported more frequently with Tirzepatide treatment than with placebo/controls.

Conclusion

The Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, for diabetes therapy has opened a new era on personalized glycemia control and weight loss in a safe manner with broad and promising clinical implications.

Serious and fatal adverse events

Individual serious AEs have been found no difference in either arm, except Tirzepatide 5 mg compared to GLP-1 Ras. (Tables 4, 5). Across all trials, none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to tirzepatide. We speculate that Tirzepatide was not associated with increased rates of serious AEs and all-cause mortality.

Specifically, participants treated with weekly tirzepatide achieved HbA1c and BW target values significantly lower than any other comparator without clinically significant increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious and all-cause fatal adverse events when compared with placebo/controls. However, gastrointestinal adverse events and decreased appetite events were reported more frequently with tirzepatide treatment than with placebo/controls.

Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide (LY3298176) developed by Eli Lilly is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. It is attached to a 20-carbon fatty diacid moiety, which binds to albumin, prolonging its half-life to 5 days and thus enabling once weekly dosing. Tirzepatide has a comparable GIP receptor binding affinity to native GIP and five times lower GLP-1 receptor affinity than that of native GLP-1. Similar to the GLP-1 RA tirzepatide is administered subcutaneously. The clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of tirzepatide has been reported in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (Table 2).

We identified three previous systematic review and meta-analysis with tirzepatide treatment for T2DM, which included four (2783 participants), seven (6609 participants) and six trials (3484 participants), respectively, thorough literature retrieve and review. Discrepancies of include literatures and research methodology render the results of these meta-analysis non-comparable to our findings. Specifically, Bhagavathula et al. summarized the efficacy results in meta-analysis, regardless of the type of comparators (insulin, GLP-1 Ras or placebo). In the meta-analysis of Thomas Karagiannis and colleagues, no analysis was performed on the efficacy of blood glucose and blood lipid. The three articles have important limitation of insufficient literature. Dutta, D and colleagues did not analysis base on therapeutic doses and comparators. Given the availability of new outcomes data and relative importance of this study, we have updated this previous literature search and meta-analysis. Instead, we opted to summary and synthesis systematic review results and produce meta-analysis estimates with potential clinical relevance and value by conducting separate analysis based on different therapeutic doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) and type of comparators for HbA 1c, FBG, BW and lipid outcomes with included all RCTs of tirzepatide in the treatment of T2DM published to date. Moreover, the present meta-analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of safety and tolerability results, which is also important the evaluation of efficacy when opting an optimal therapy in clinical treatment.

### Meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials comparing incretin-based glucose-lowering medications and basal insulin: an update including recently developed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide [^f30abd8c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of injectable incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (IBGLMs) versus basal insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of head-to-head comparisons of IBGLMs (short- and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide) versus basal insulin using a PubMed database search (April 2022). The primary endpoint was difference in reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) versus baseline between pooled IBGLMs (fixed-effects meta-analysis) and their subgroups (random-effects meta-analysis) versus basal insulin treatment (mean differences). Secondary endpoints were fasting plasma glucose, body weight, HbA 1c target achievement, hypoglycaemia, blood pressure and lipids. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Jadad scores and the Risk of Bias tool 2.0.

Results

In all, 20 studies, representing 47 study arms and 11843 patients, were eligible. Compared with basal insulin, IGBLMs lowered HbA 1c by 0.48 (0.45-0.52)% more than did basal insulin treatment. This effect was driven by pooled long-acting GLP-1RAs (ΔHbA 1c -0.25 [-0.38; -0.11]%) and the only GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide (pooled doses; ΔHbA 1c -0.90 [-1.06; -0.75]%), while short-acting GLP-1RAs were equally effective compared with basal insulin (P = 0.90). All IBGLM subgroups achieved significantly lower body weight versus insulin treatment (-4.6 [-4.7; -4.4] kg), in particular tirzepatide (-12.0 [-13.8; -10.1] kg). IBGLMs significantly reduced hypoglycaemia and blood pressure and improved lipid variables. Risk of bias was low. IBGLM treatment was associated with more nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and study medication discontinuation.

Conclusions

Recently introduced, highly effective IBGLMs were superior to basal insulin treatment, reinforcing the recommendation that IBGLMs should be considered as the first injectable treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^699a1b46]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This was a 12‐week phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three different 8‐week dose‐escalation regimens followed by 4‐week dosing of 12 or 15 mg of the dual GIP and GLP‐1 RA, tirzepatide. The escalation regimens investigated in this study, along with results from the previously published primary phase 2b study, 20 which used a shorter dose‐escalation regimen, were designed to support collection of data for selection of therapeutic doses and dose‐escalation steps for investigation within the phase 3 studies of tirzepatide. The escalation regimens were designed to evaluate the differences in efficacy and tolerability between the doses used at the initiation of therapy (2.5 or 4 mg), the differences across different escalation steps (2.5, 4, 5 or 7.5 mg), and the differences between the groups during the entire 12‐week treatment period.

Dual GIP and GLP-1 Agonism

Co-administration of GIP and a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) in healthy individuals has a additive effect, generating a significantly increased insulin response compared with separate administration of each hormone. Furthermore, the combined infusion produced a significant glucagonostatic effect while separate administration of GIP or GLP-1 did not suppress glucagon secretion more than glucose alone. However, in people with T2DM, co-administration of GIP and GLP-1 over a short period of time (4–6 h) did not generate an insulin response greater than that of GLP-1 administration alone.

The long-term effect of GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism was first described by Finan et al. who developed a unimolecular dual agonist of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, referred to as a ‘twincretin’. The twincretin was shown to have high affinity to GLP-1 and GIP receptors with negligible glucagon receptor activity. In animal studies, GIP and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist therapy at 1–3 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood glucose, body weight, food intake and fat mass compared to placebo, equimolar dose of exendin-4 or liraglutide. The co-agonist can be modified by attaching a polyethylene glycol (PEG) or a 16-carbon acyl chain to extend half-life (allowing weekly dosing). The PEGylated co-agonist was investigated in 44 people with T2DM. After 6 weeks, a dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c compared to placebo was observed. The co-agonist was well tolerated with mild to moderate GI side effects and no hypoglycaemic events.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^3597b2ef]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety data at 104weeks in tirzepatide-treated participants with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea.

Materials and Methods

This post-hoc analysis was based on the SURPASS-4 data (NCT03730662), a multicenter, Phase III trial. Participants were randomised to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15mg) or insulin glargine. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 104weeks. Key secondary endpoints were changes in body weight and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c <7.0%. Safety endpoints included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia.

Results

This post-hoc analysis included 1,500 participants. At Week 104, participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater mean reduction in HbA1c (5mg: -2.3%, 10mg: -2.5%, 15mg: -2.6%) compared with the insulin glargine group (-1.0%) (p<0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater reduction in body weight (5mg: -7.6kg, 10mg: -10.0kg, 15mg: -11.4kg) compared with the insulin glargine group (2.1kg) (p<0.001). Significantly more participants in the tirzepatide group achieved HbA1c <7.0% compared with the insulin glargine group (p<0.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the tirzepatide groups, and gastrointestinal AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide significantly improved glycaemic control and body weight reduction compared to insulin glargine over 104weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The safety profile of tirzepatide was acceptable, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.

### The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide / glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: is the future bright? [^3b62cdc1]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. It has a prolonged half-life of 5 days, which enables once-weekly dosing. Studies have hitherto demonstrated its superiority in achieving optimal glycaemic control and body weight management, as compared with various agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, it is expected to enrich our therapeutic armamentarium in T2DM. However, further experience, notably longer follow-up data and information on cardiovascular effects, is still needed.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^873ba993]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM receiving treatment with basal insulin, aligning with the SURPASS-5 trial. Three doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) were compared with the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide 1.50 mg, exenatide 2 mg QW, exenatide 10 μg BID, and lixisenatide 20 μg with study designs comparable to SURPASS-5.

The network analyses revealed that all doses of tirzepatide demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in HbA1c and body weight from baseline compared with the selected GLP-1 RAs. All doses of tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significantly greater odds of reaching the HbA1c targets of HbA1c < 7.0% and HbA1c ≤ 6.5% compared with all selected GLP-1 RAs, with all doses of tirzepatide demonstrating significantly greater odds of reaching a target weight loss of ≥ 5% compared with exenatide 2 mg QW. However, exenatide was the only GLP-1 RA in the network for this endpoint. Overall, tirzepatide was similar to most GLP-1 RAs in terms of the odds of experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. However, patients receiving all doses of tirzepatide had statistically significantly higher odds of experiencing nausea compared with exenatide 2 mg QW, and patients receiving tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg had statistically significantly higher odds of experiencing vomiting compared with exenatide 2 mg QW. All doses of tirzepatide were comparable with all selected GLP-1 RAs in terms of the odds of experiencing at least one episode of hypoglycaemia with BG < 54 mg/dL with or without severe hypoglycaemia and the odds of patients discontinuing treatment because of AEs.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to summary and synthesis the main efficacy and safety outcomes from the most up-to-date RCTs of weekly tirzepatide doses of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Based on our meta-analysis results, the dose-dependent reduction of HbA1c, FBG and BW induced by tirzepatide compared with placebo and weekly GLP-1 receptor antagonist, as well as insulin regimen has important clinical significance. In terms of lowering of lipid, Tirzepatide resulted in a dose-dependent improve of TG when compared with the GLP-1 Ras (1 mg/week with semaglutide and 1.5 mg/week with dulaglutide). Moreover, our system-review found the most commonly observed side effects were GE and decreased appetite in comparison with various anti-hyperglycaemic agents. The decreased appetite might be contributed to the reduction in weight and it is consistent with previous research reports, indicating a more profound effective on regulating food intake and satiety compared with GLP-1 RAs. Considering the gastrointestinal system, study has suggested the lower incidence of treatment-related gastrointestinal system did seem to be associated with Lower initial dose and smaller subsequent dose increment. The incidence of GE and discontinuation due to AEs were similar when compared Tirzepatide with placebo. Therefore, we speculated that the increased odds of DT vs all comparators might be attributed to the severity of GEs experienced with tirzepatide. Notably, this beneficial hypoglycemic effect of tirzepatide was not associated with increased incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious and all-cause fatal adverse events. These results indicate it is possible to achieve well established, but stringent, individualizing the glycemic and BW targets for diabesity patients in a safe manner.

Patients with T2DM and Weight-Related Comorbidities

The clinical burden associated with overweight and obesity is high, emerging as one of the leading causes of death. Patients with T2DM and overweight or obesity present a higher risk of weight-associated comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, joint pain, sleep apnea, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or functionality. Care of people with diabetes and weight-related comorbidities should include strategies to achieve weight loss.

In the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program, weight loss in adults with T2DM treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg was associated with an improvement in weight-related and overall HRQoL, with greater improvement observed in participants achieving higher weight loss.

Qualitative interviews conducted with tirzepatide-treated patients with T2DM who had recently completed one of two trials (SURPASS-2, SURPASS-3) revealed their satisfaction with their weight loss, and the broad and meaningful impact this had on multiple aspects of their quality of life and daily activities.

Tirzepatide is being studied in several weight-related diseases, such as sleep apnea, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction, thus specific improvements in these weight-related diseases are currently under investigation.

Patients with T2DM and with Overweight or Obesity and on Insulin Treatment

Tirzepatide improved markers of insulin sensitivity partly due to weight loss. Tirzepatide increased insulin sensitivity by 63%, in the context of a mean weight loss of 11.2 kg. Insulin-resistant patients with T2DM and overweight or obesity receiving insulin treatment would benefit from the efficacy of tirzepatide in reducing body weight, and for such patients, insulin dose reduction would be a feasible objective. In SURPASS 6, patients with T2DM and a mean baseline BMI of 33 kg/m 2 receiving insulin glargine in combination with metformin were randomized to tirzepatide or insulin lispro. At 52 weeks, compared to insulin lispro, tirzepatide (pooled) achieved better results for HbA1c and weight reduction from baseline, with substantially lower insulin use (from a geometric mean total baseline daily insulin use of 46 IU to 13 IU [0.15 IU/kg] in the tirzepatide group vs. 112 IU (1.2 IU/kg)) in the insulin lispro group), with 8% to 19% of tirzepatide-treated participants completely discontinuing insulin glargine therapy by week 52.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-1): a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial [^09e963ba]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite advancements in care, many people with type 2 diabetes do not meet treatment goals; thus, development of new therapies is needed. We aimed to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide monotherapy versus placebo in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone.

Methods

We did a 40-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (SURPASS-1), at 52 medical research centres and hospitals in India, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Adult participants (≥18 years) were included if they had type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and if they were naive to injectable diabetes therapy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) via computer-generated random sequence to once a week tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg), or placebo. All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the mean change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) from baseline at 40 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03954834.

Findings

From June 3, 2019, to Oct 28, 2020, of 705 individuals assessed for eligibility, 478 (mean baseline HbA 1c 7·9% [63 mmol/mol], age 54·1 years [SD 11·9], 231 [48%] women, diabetes duration 4·7 years, and body-mass index 31·9 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg (n=121 [25%]), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=121 [25%]), tirzepatide 15 mg (n=121 [25%]), or placebo (n=115 [24%]). 66 (14%) participants discontinued the study drug and 50 (10%) discontinued the study prematurely. At 40 weeks, all tirzepatide doses were superior to placebo for changes from baseline in HbA 1c , fasting serum glucose, bodyweight, and HbA 1c targets of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol) and less than 5·7% (<39 mmol/mol). Mean HbA 1c decreased from baseline by 1·87% (20 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 5 mg, 1·89% (21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2·07% (23 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 15 mg versus +0·04% with placebo (+0·4 mmol/mol), resulting in estimated treatment differences versus placebo of -1·91% (-21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 5 mg, -1·93% (-21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 10 mg, and -2·11% (-23 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 15 mg (all p<0·0001). More participants on tirzepatide than on placebo met HbA 1c targets of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol; 87-92% vs 20%) and 6·5% or less (≤48 mmol/mol; 81-86% vs 10%) and 31-52% of patients on tirzepatide versus 1% on placebo reached an HbA 1c of less than 5·7% (<39 mmol/mol). Tirzepatide induced a dose-dependent bodyweight loss ranging from 7·0 to 9·5 kg. The most frequent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild to moderate and transient gastrointestinal events, including nausea (12-18% vs 6%), diarrhoea (12-14% vs 8%), and vomiting (2-6% vs 2%). No clinically significant (<54 mg/dL [<3 mmol/L]) or severe hypoglycaemia were reported with tirzepatide. One death occurred in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide showed robust improvements in glycaemic control and bodyweight, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The safety profile was consistent with GLP-1 receptor agonists, indicating a potential monotherapy use of tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes treatment.

### Tirzepatide after intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity: the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 trial [^7a07fb6b]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-3 was published by Thomas A Wadden and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in adult patients with overweight or obesity who underwent intensive lifestyle intervention? In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the population was: 579 patients (364 female, 215 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM, T2DM, ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar state/coma; self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous planned surgical treatment for obesity; history of chronic or acute pancreatitis. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the interventions were: n=287 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n=292 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (18.4% vs. -2.5%; ARD 20.8, 95% CI 18.5 to 23.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (87.5% vs. 16.5%; OR 34.6, 95% CI 19.2 to 62.6) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (76.7% vs. 8.9%; OR 34.7, 95% CI 17.6 to 68.3) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (14.6 cm vs. -0.2 cm; AD 14.8 cm, 95% CI 12.5 to 17.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^5dc3eaf8]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety and Tolerability of Tirzepatide

Since tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist, the side effect profile is comparable to that of a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The most frequently observed side effects were related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system and nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. The incidence of GI adverse events was 23.1% for 1 mg, 32.7% for 5 mg, 51.0% for 10 mg and 66.0% for 15 mg, demonstrating a dose-dependent behaviour (versus 42.6% for dulaglutide and 9.8% for placebo). The second most common adverse effect was reduced appetite, the incidence ranging from 3.8% to 18.9% in tirzepatide-treated groups. Study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was greater with the higher dose of tirzepatide (25% with the 15 mg group, 9.1% with the 10 mg group and 5.1% with the 5 mg group); the discontinuation rate for dulaglutide was 11.1%.

The titration-regimen trial also demonstrated the dose-dependent incidence of GI adverse events: 48.3%, 57.1% and 46.4% in the tirzepatide 12 mg, 15 mg-1 and 15 mg-2 groups, respectively, and 11.5% with placebo. Prevalence of study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was 3.4% (1 patient), 3.6% (1 patient), no patient and 3.8% (1 patient) in the tirzepatide 12 mg, 15 mg-1, 15 mg-2 and placebo groups, respectively. These findings contrasted with those of the 26-week phase 2 clinical trial where a greater prevalence of study drug discontinuation occurred in the higher dose group. The study authors suggested that a lower starting dose and small subsequent dose increments were associated with lower incidence of GI adverse events. The severity of GI adverse events in both trials was mild to moderate.

### Comparison of dose escalation versus switching to tirzepatide among people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on lower doses of dulaglutide: a randomized clinical trial [^06925eae]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes or obesity, showed clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) and body weight in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial program.

Objective

To compare efficacy and safety of escalation of dulaglutide dose versus switching to tirzepatide in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 4 trial (SURPASS-SWITCH [A Phase 4, Randomized, Open-Label, Active-Controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Weekly Dulaglutide to Weekly Tirzepatide in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes], ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05564039).

Setting

38 sites across 5 countries.

Participants

Adults with HbA 1c 7.0% or greater to 9.5% or less, stable body weight, body mass index of 25 kg/m 2 or greater, receiving a stable dose of dulaglutide (0.75 or 1.5 mg) for at least 6 months and 0 to 3 oral antihyperglycemic medications for at least 3 months.

Intervention

Escalation of dulaglutide to 4.5 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or switching to tirzepatide.

Measurements

The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 40. The key secondary end point was change from baseline in weight at week 40.

Results

A total of 282 adults were randomly assigned to tirzepatide ( n = 139) or dulaglutide ( n = 143). Change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 40 was -1.44% (SE, 0.07) with tirzepatide, 15 mg or MTD, and -0.67% (SE, 0.08) with dulaglutide, 4.5 mg or MTD (estimated treatment difference, -0.77% [95% CI, -0.98% to -0.56%; P <0.001]). Change from baseline in weight at week 40 was -10.5 kg (SE, 0.5) with tirzepatide and -3.6 kg (SE, 0.5) with dulaglutide (estimated treatment difference, -6.9 kg [CI, -8.3 to -5.5 kg; P <0.001]). Serious adverse events were reported by 10 (7.2%) tirzepatide and 10 (7.0%) dulaglutide participants. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea and diarrhea.

Limitation

Open-label design.

Conclusion

In SURPASS-SWITCH, switching treatment to tirzepatide provided additional HbA 1c reduction and weight loss compared with escalating treatment with dulaglutide.

### Defining the role of basal and prandial insulin for optimal glycemic control [^b31dd19e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease characterized by early impairment of beta-cell function and ultimately loss of beta-cell mass. Hence, a single daily injection of a long-acting insulin is commonly initiated after intensification of oral antihyperglycemic therapy. Hemoglobin A1C should be measured every 3 months and therapy adjusted if the target is not met. As beta-cell function continues to decline, it is often necessary to add exogenous bolus insulin therapy, using short-acting insulin analogs or regular insulin. Alternatively, the use of pre-mixed insulin preparations, combining both long-acting and short-acting insulins, may be used.

Bodyweight

A total of 40 studies (26,490 patients) were included in the main analysis for change in BW. Pairwise meta-analysis results are presented in Supplementary Appendix S6.4, while network meta-analysis results are presented in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Appendix S22. All doses of tirzepatide, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and high-dose GLP-1RA significantly reduced BW compared to placebo, while the two GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC were neutral. Tirzepatide 15 mg ranked first in terms of BW lowering (6 studies, 1320 patients, MD −10.08 kg, 95% CI [−10.45; −9.72], high certainty) and was significantly more efficacious than all other treatment strategies (Supplementary Appendix S22). Tirzepatide 5 mg and GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination were equally efficacious (MD −0.02 kg, 95% CI [−0.71; 0.67], low certainty) and superior to high-dose GLP-1RA, which in turn were superior to either GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^4c53c021]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidence gaps and research needs—Most included studies had shorter-term follow-up. The evidence was very uncertain regarding predefined subgroups of interest, including demographic subgroups, treatment-naive patients, and patients with established CVD or CKD, and evidence was insufficient or had low certainty regarding cost-effectiveness analyses directly comparing newer type 2 diabetes medications or pharmacologic classes. For newer type 2 diabetes medications compared with usual care, evidence was not available on the effects of GLP-1 agonists for the progression of CKD and effects of tirzepatide on MI, stroke, hospitalizations for CHF, and progression of CKD. Evidence from RCTs was lacking for examined newer diabetes pharmacologic classes in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated, and the net benefit and cost-effectiveness of combined formulations or combined treatments with newer pharmacologic classes beyond glycemic control are currently unknown.

### Changes in basal and bolus insulin requirements with tirzepatide as an adjunctive therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes using tandem control-IQ [^f70fab27]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study was aimed at investigating changes in insulin requirements and glycemic outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using Control IQ (Tandem Diabetes) automated insulin delivery system (AID) over 8 months of tirzepatide treatment.

Methods

In this single-center, observational study, we collected demographic, A1c, weight, sensor glucose, and insulin dose data for adults with T1D who were using AID and initiated tirzepatide adjunct therapy for clinical indications (n = 11, median age 37, 64% female and mean body mass index of 39.6 kg/m 2). Data were compared from baseline and over 8 months.

Results

Within 2 months of tirzepatide treatment, there were significant reductions in total daily insulin [median (IQR) 73.9 (47.6–95.8) to 51.7 (46.7–66.8) units/day, p < 0.001], basal insulin [47 (28.2–51.8) to 32.4 (25.5–46.3) units/day, p < 0.001], and bolus insulin [31.4 (19.9–38.3) to 17.9 (14.9–22.2) units/day, p < 0.001] requirements. Insulin dose reduction from 2 to 8 months was modest. The frequency of user-initiated boluses did not differ throughout the study. Despite reductions in total insulin requirement, time in range (70–180 mg/dl) increased by 7%, A1c reduced by 0.5%, weight reduced by 9%, without increase in time below 70 mg/dl.

Conclusions

This pilot study provides clinical guidance on insulin titration for adults with T1D who may initiate tirzepatide therapy. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend reducing 25% of total daily insulin dose at tirzepatide initiation in adults with T1D using AID with baseline A1c of less than 7.5%. Higher doses of tirzepatide were associated with greater weight loss, however, the reduction in insulin requirement was minimal.

### Achievement of glycaemic targets with weight loss and without hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes with the once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS-1 to-5 studies [^271a925d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess composite endpoints combining glycaemic control (HbA1c <7.0%, ≤6.5% or <5.7%) with weight loss (≥5%, ≥10% or ≥15%) and without hypoglycaemia with tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

Data from the phase 3 SURPASS programme were evaluated post hoc by trial. Participants with T2D were randomized to tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), placebo (SURPASS-1,5), semaglutide 1mg (SURPASS-2) or titrated basal insulin (SURPASS-3,4). The proportions of participants achieving the composite endpoints were compared between tirzepatide and the respective comparator groups at week 40/52.

Results

The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 5% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia ranged from 43% to 82% with tirzepatide across the SURPASS-1 to -5 trials versus 4%-5% with placebo, 51% with semaglutide 1mg and 5% with basal insulin (P<.001 vs. all comparators). The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 10% or more, or 15% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia were significantly higher with all tirzepatide doses versus comparators across trials (P<.001 or P<.05). Similar results were observed for all other combinations of endpoints with an HbA1c value of 6.5% or less, or less than 5.7%, with more tirzepatide-treated participants achieving these endpoints versus those in the comparator groups, including semaglutide.

Conclusions

Across the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials, more tirzepatide-treated participants with T2D achieved clinically meaningful composite endpoints, which included reaching glycaemic targets with various degrees of weight loss and without hypoglycaemia, than those in the comparator groups.
