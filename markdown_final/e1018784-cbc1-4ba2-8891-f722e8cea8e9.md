## Question

what would be the best treatement a 4 cm HCC in a MELD score 6 cirrhotic male aged 60.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for a solitary 4 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 60-year-old cirrhotic male with MELD 6 and presumed absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct staging and whether this fits Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early stage. Then, I should verify operative candidacy for liver resection by assessing liver function, portal hypertension, and technical feasibility. Next, I will consider whether liver transplantation is indicated or prioritized in a MELD 6 patient within Milan criteria. After that, I need to evaluate the role, if any, for ablation in a 4 cm lesion. Finally, I will outline contingency pathways, bridging strategies if transplant is pursued, and surveillance. I will anchor this plan on contemporary EASL, ESMO, AASLD, and BSG guidance aligned to the BCLC framework [^113PTj3i] [^116shLXz] [^112Kxd8H] [^116b69cS].

> Let me first confirm the staging. With a single 4 cm tumor, preserved performance, and well-compensated cirrhosis (MELD 6), this fits BCLC stage A, provided there is no macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, or clinically significant portal hypertension. Wait, let me verify the framework I'm applying: both ESMO and BSG endorse BCLC for prognostication and treatment allocation, and AASLD recommends documenting tumor burden, liver function, and performance at initial evaluation, all of which support classifying this as early-stage disease here [^113PTj3i] [^111Nx9hj] [^116shLXz].

> Next, I should review curative-intent options with emphasis on resection in compensated cirrhosis without portal hypertension. ESMO explicitly recommends resection for a single tumor greater than 2 cm in the absence of portal hypertension in BCLC 0–A, and EASL emphasizes a multiparametric composite assessment to select for resection when liver function is preserved and an adequate future liver remnant can be maintained. Hold on, I should verify the society consensus: BSG similarly supports resection as first-line for solitary HCC in compensated cirrhosis when a sufficient remnant can be preserved. This converges on resection as the preferred option for a 4 cm solitary HCC in a well-compensated cirrhotic patient absent portal hypertension [^111VUtVm] [^112Kxd8H] [^1171bpi2] [^116b69cS].

> I need to ensure the operative risk is acceptably low with MELD 6. Let me check the MELD-based risk data: retrospective series demonstrate that MELD ≥ 11 predicts high risk of postoperative liver failure after hepatectomy, while patients with MELD < 9 had no postoperative liver failure and low morbidity; broader series also show higher mortality and liver-related complications with MELD over roughly 8–9. Hold on, I should double-check that MELD 6 sits in the safest stratum: yes, MELD 6 is associated with very low perioperative hepatic failure risk, supporting resection candidacy from a hepatic reserve standpoint [^115dDMS1] [^112cuVL4].

> Now, I will examine technical and perioperative considerations. I need to confirm absence of clinically significant portal hypertension via HVPG when available or clinical surrogates (platelets, splenomegaly, varices), ensure an adequate future liver remnant, and assess feasibility of an anatomic or limited nonanatomic resection based on tumor location. Let me verify best practice on approach: both EASL and ESMO favor minimally invasive resection when feasible in cirrhosis, and BSG underscores comprehensive preoperative assessment integrating liver function, portal hypertension, extent of hepatectomy, and performance status to keep perioperative mortality ≤ 3% and morbidity ≤ 20% in appropriate centers [^111JSy7P] [^1115wrfd] [^115ywtbJ] [^112Kxd8H].

> But wait, what if we consider transplantation upfront because the patient meets Milan criteria with a solitary lesion ≤ 5 cm. I should confirm indications and prioritization. ESMO recommends orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for patients within Milan with expected 5-year survival around 70%, and EASL reserves transplantation within Milan for those unsuitable for resection due to anatomical factors, marginal liver function, or other liver-related contraindications. AASLD specifically prioritizes transplant for early HCC with clinically significant portal hypertension and/or decompensated cirrhosis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in a MELD 6, well-compensated patient likely without portal hypertension, transplant priority and access are low, wait times can be prolonged, and intention-to-treat outcomes may be compromised; bridging locoregional therapy is advised if listing proceeds with anticipated delays [^114uLUV8] [^1144AAGt] [^117Wb6kM] [^113ebYxw] [^112gCHvB] [^114gzQ6G].

> Let me consider ablation. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ablation could be equivalent here, but I should verify the size threshold. EASL and BSG endorse thermal ablation as first-line for solitary lesions ≤ 2 cm, while ESMO allows RFA/MWA in 3–5 cm tumors only when patients are ineligible for resection or as a bridge to transplant due to higher local failure beyond 3 cm. So for a 4 cm tumor in a resection-eligible, well-compensated patient, ablation would be inferior for durable local control and is better reserved for those unfit for surgery or as bridging therapy [^116d7GZB] [^111KhQkm] [^1144AAGt] [^114F4r8w].

> Next, I should review contingency and bridging strategies if resection is not feasible because of tumor location, inadequate remnant, or unexpected portal hypertension. I will now examine locoregional options: TACE, TARE, or ablation can be used to control disease or bridge to OLT when listing is pursued and an extended wait is anticipated, with efficacy assessed by mRECIST. Hold on, I should verify guidance on bridging: both AASLD and EASL recommend locoregional therapy to reduce waitlist dropout when prolonged wait is expected, and ESMO supports multiple bridging modalities, while mRECIST is recommended to evaluate response to locoregional therapy [^113ebYxw] [^112gCHvB] [^114gzQ6G] [^115823Gj].

> I need to synthesize the recommendation. Given BCLC A staging, MELD 6, likely absence of significant portal hypertension, and solitary 4 cm tumor, the preferred curative approach is liver resection, ideally via minimally invasive technique if anatomy permits, with intraoperative ultrasound to secure negative margins and protect an adequate future liver remnant. Let me reconsider transplant positioning: transplantation remains an excellent salvage option if high-risk pathology emerges or recurrence occurs, but upfront OLT is generally not prioritized here due to low MELD and preserved function. This plan aligns with EASL's composite assessment for resection, ESMO's size-based resection recommendation without portal hypertension, and BSG's endorsement of resection in compensated cirrhosis with sufficient remnant, with consideration of transplant in resected patients at high risk of recurrence after an observation period [^112Kxd8H] [^111VUtVm] [^116b69cS] [^113X7Ldy] [^111JSy7P].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up strategy and quality safeguards. After curative-intent therapy, I need to ensure close surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter, with AFP monitoring where appropriate, coordinated in a multidisciplinary setting. Hold on, I should verify the surveillance backbone in cirrhosis: major societies endorse ongoing structured surveillance in cirrhosis when patients are candidates for curative-intent therapy, and EASL emphasizes multidisciplinary, personalized follow-up to navigate transitions across surgical and locoregional domains, which applies post-resection here as well [^notfound] [^notfound].

> Bottom line, after double-checking stage, liver reserve, and guideline concordance, I recommend primary liver resection for this solitary 4 cm HCC in a MELD 6, likely non–portal hypertensive cirrhotic patient, with transplant reserved for nonresectability, presence of clinically significant portal hypertension, decompensation, or as salvage if recurrence or high-risk pathology is demonstrated after an adequate observation interval, using bridging locoregional therapy only if transplant listing and prolonged waiting are pursued [^111VUtVm] [^112Kxd8H] [^117Wb6kM] [^113X7Ldy] [^112gCHvB].

For a 60-year-old male with a solitary 4 cm HCC and MELD 6 cirrhosis, the best treatment is **surgical resection** if there is no clinically significant portal hypertension, adequate future liver remnant, and good performance status [^112Kxd8H] [^111VUtVm]. If resection is not feasible due to portal hypertension or marginal liver function, **liver transplantation** is the next best option, as the patient is within **Milan criteria** [^114uLUV8] [^1144AAGt]. If neither resection nor transplantation is possible, consider TACE or SBRT as alternatives. Management should be individualized by a multidisciplinary team, with resection preferred when feasible and transplantation as second-line.

## Patient assessment and staging

Accurate staging and liver function assessment are critical in determining the optimal treatment strategy. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) **staging system** is widely recommended for prognostic assessment and treatment allocation [^113PTj3i] [^111Nx9hj]. A solitary 4 cm HCC in a patient with preserved liver function (MELD 6) is classified as **BCLC stage A** (early stage), which typically includes solitary tumors > 2 cm or up to three nodules ≤ 3 cm, with preserved liver function and good performance status.

---

## Treatment options

The main **curative treatment options** for early-stage HCC in patients with preserved liver function include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapies. Choice depends on tumor characteristics, liver function, portal hypertension, and comorbidities.

---

### Surgical resection

Surgical resection is considered the **preferred treatment** for solitary HCC in patients with preserved liver function and no clinically significant portal hypertension [^112Kxd8H] [^111VUtVm]. The MELD score is a useful predictor of postoperative outcomes, with lower MELD scores associated with lower morbidity and mortality [^112cuVL4] [^115dDMS1]. Specifically, patients with MELD scores ≤ 8 have significantly lower postoperative complications and mortality rates compared to those with higher MELD scores [^112cuVL4]. In this patient, with a solitary 4 cm HCC and MELD 6, surgical resection is **strongly recommended** if there is no clinically significant portal hypertension, an adequate future liver remnant, and good performance status [^112Kxd8H] [^111VUtVm]. When feasible, minimally invasive approaches — such as laparoscopic resection — are preferred due to lower morbidity and faster recovery [^111JSy7P] [^1115wrfd].

---

### Liver transplantation

Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with early-stage HCC within Milan criteria (single tumor ≤ 5 cm or up to three nodules ≤ 3 cm) who are unsuitable for resection due to portal hypertension, marginal liver function, or other contraindications [^114uLUV8] [^1144AAGt], with excellent long-term outcomes, including approximately 70% 5-year survival and recurrence rates below 10% [^114uLUV8]. However, in patients with preserved liver function (MELD 6) and no significant portal hypertension, transplantation is generally considered **second-line after resection** due to organ scarcity, waiting list dropout risk, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression [^1139hZhJ] [^1144AAGt].

---

### Local ablative therapies

Local ablative therapies, such as **radiofrequency ablation (RFA)** or **microwave ablation (MWA)**, are generally reserved for tumors ≤ 3 cm or patients unsuitable for surgery [^114F4r8w] [^111KhQkm]. For tumors 3–5 cm, ablation may be considered in selected patients ineligible for resection or as a bridge to transplantation [^114F4r8w]. However, surgical resection remains superior for solitary tumors > 2 cm in patients with preserved liver function [^112Kxd8H].

---

### Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic therapy

TACE is typically reserved for intermediate-stage HCC (BCLC B) and is **not recommended as first-line** therapy for solitary tumors in patients with preserved liver function [^113xRafx]. Systemic therapy is indicated for advanced-stage HCC or patients unsuitable for locoregional therapies [^117VvV8y].

---

## Recommended treatment strategy

Based on current guidelines and evidence, the **recommended treatment strategy** for a 60-year-old male with a solitary 4 cm HCC and MELD 6 cirrhosis is as follows:

| **Treatment option** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgical resection | - No clinically significant portal hypertension <br/> - Adequate future liver remnant <br/> - Good performance status | First-line treatment |
| Liver transplantation | - Significant portal hypertension <br/> - Marginal liver function <br/> - Other contraindications to resection | Second-line treatment |
| Local ablative therapy | Tumor location unsuitable for resection or patient comorbidities preclude surgery | Alternative treatment |
| TACE or systemic therapy | Advanced-stage HCC or patients unsuitable for curative therapies | Not recommended as first-line |

---

## Conclusion

The best treatment for a 60-year-old male with a solitary 4 cm HCC and MELD 6 cirrhosis is **surgical resection**, provided there is no clinically significant portal hypertension and an adequate future liver remnant. Liver transplantation is a second-line option for patients unsuitable for resection. Local ablative therapies may be considered in selected cases, but resection remains the preferred curative approach.

### Outcomes in elderly patients undergoing liver transplantation compared with liver-directed ablative therapy in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma [^116MC5b2]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the accepted treatment for patients with unresectable, early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the setting of cirrhosis. Due to increasing waitlist demand for OLT, determining optimal groups for transplant is critical. Elderly patients are known to have poorer postoperative outcomes. Considering the effectiveness of liver-directed therapies for HCC, we sought to determine whether elderly patients received a survival benefit from OLT over liver-directed therapy alone.

- **Study design**: The National Cancer Database participant use file was used to analyze data between 2004 and 2017. Only patients ≥ 70 years of age who received OLT or liver-directed therapy alone were included. Patients with alpha-fetoprotein > 500 ng/mL or missing alpha-fetoprotein values were excluded. Baseline demographic variables, model for end-stage liver disease score, and overall survival from time of diagnosis were collected. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival, Cox proportional hazards model, and propensity score matching were used.

- **Results**: A total of 2,377 patients received ablative therapy alone, and 214 patients received OLT. Multivariable analysis and Kaplan-Meier showed that OLT conferred a significant survival benefit compared to liver-directed therapy alone. Age was also associated with a yearly 3% increase in risk of mortality. Propensity-matched analysis also demonstrated a significant survival benefit for elderly patients receiving OLT compared to liver-directed therapy alone.

- **Conclusion**: Despite increased age and associated risks, OLT provided significant survival benefits for elderly patients compared to liver-directed therapy alone.

Liver transplantation offers excellent results in selected patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In suitable candidates, liver transplantation provides the optimal oncological resection, removes the cirrhotic liver, thus reducing the risk of recurrent or metachronous HCC, and restores liver function. However, liver transplantation is not a panacea. Its applicability is limited by organ shortages, which might also compromise intention-to-treat outcomes due to waiting list dropout. Other relevant issues include the morbidity and mortality associated with the operation itself and the need for long-term mandatory immunosuppressive therapy.

In the 1980s, many liver transplantation procedures were performed on patients with HCC, using broad selection criteria for eligibility. Outcomes were poor due to high recurrence rates of the tumor after transplant, with 32–54% recurrence at 5 years and a 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. These initial experiences helped identify candidates who might benefit most from liver transplantation. Subsequently, a number of groups reported good results in patients with limited tumor burden. In a seminal study, four-year post-transplant survival equivalent to non-cancer indications and low recurrence rates of HCC were reported for patients within the 'Milan criteria': a solitary HCC nodule ≤ 5 cm or up to three nodules ≤ 3 cm in the absence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic disease spread, with a four-year survival rate of 74% and HCC recurrence of 8%. The Milan criteria became the benchmark for defining suitable candidates for liver transplantation in terms of tumor morphology and were incorporated into many national allocation systems.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: Diagnosis and treatment [^114VpHn6]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary malignancy of the liver and appears to be rising in incidence in the United States and other developed Western countries. Imaging studies play a key role in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and more commonly, patients are being diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage. The use of triphasic computed tomography scanning and improved magnetic resonance imaging equipment and protocols has led to greater sensitivity and specificity for these techniques in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Accurate staging of hepatocellular carcinoma is important in determining prognosis and in helping decide the best treatment for each patient. No single staging system appears optimal, but important factors to consider are the size of the tumor, the severity of underlying liver disease, and the functional status of the patient. Liver transplantation has grown in importance as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma but may be limited by the availability of donor organs and long waiting times. This situation may be improved by greater use of living donor liver transplantation.

Hepatic resection remains an important treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in the absence of cirrhosis. Tumor ablation by alcohol injection or radiofrequency ablation is associated with favorable outcomes and may be considered a potentially curative treatment. Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains a key goal in improving the poor prognosis of this form of liver cancer. Identifying hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage is crucial.

### A review and update of treatment options and controversies in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114ttkoA]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To review the management and outline recent advances and address controversies in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The treatment of HCC is multidisciplinary, involving hepatologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, and other disciplines. Each of these disciplines brings its unique perspective and differing opinions that add to controversies in the management of HCC.

A focused literature review was performed to identify recent studies on HCC management and summarize relevant information on the various therapeutic modalities and controversies involved in the treatment of HCC.

- **Results**: The main treatment algorithms continue to rely on hepatic resection or transplantation, with controversies involving patients harboring early-stage disease and borderline hepatic function. The other treatment strategies include locoregional therapies, radiation, and systemic therapy used alone or combined with other treatment modalities. Recent advances in locoregional therapies, radiation, and systemic therapies have provided better therapeutic options, with curative intent potential for some locoregional therapies. Further refinements in combination therapies, such as algorithms consisting of locoregional therapies and systemic or radiation therapies, are likely to add additional options and improve survival.

The management of HCC has witnessed significant strides with advances in existing options and the introduction of several new ones.

### The model for end-stage liver disease based cancer staging systems are better prognostic models for hepatocellular carcinoma: A prospective sequential survey [^115M4EBe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is a major component in staging for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) is a better prognostic predictor for cirrhotic patients compared to the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) system, which is a parameter in Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and Japan Integrated Scoring (JIS) system.

- **Aim**: To investigate if the MELD-based models have a better prognostic ability.

- **Methods**: In the MELD-based model, the CTP class was replaced with the MELD score at cutoffs of 14. The modified systems were prospectively compared with the original counterpart in 430 consecutive HCC patients. Using 6-month mortality as the end point, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the original and modified system was compared sequentially on a 3-monthly basis.

- **Results**: At the final inspection, the modified CLIP and JIS system had a significantly higher AUC compared to the original system (0.92 vs 0.893 for CLIP, P < 0.018; 0.88 vs 0.842 for JIS, P = 0.002), but there was no significant difference for the BCLC system (0.848 vs 0.841, P = 0.561). Survival analysis showed modified CLIP and JIS, and to a lesser extent, the modified BCLC system, had a higher homogeneity likelihood ratio and discriminatory ability linear trend, and a lower Akaike information criterion in the Cox multivariate model, indicating a better discriminatory ability for different stage categories.

- **Conclusions**: The MELD-based CLIP and JIS staging systems have an improved predictive ability compared to the original versions.

### Decompensated cirrhosis but low MELD-should we wait or refer for liver transplantation [^112voG1h]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Cirrhosis constitutes a significant global health burden, with decompensation characterized by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. These decompensation features are independent predictors of mortality. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment for patients with cirrhosis. However, given that it is a limited resource, its allocation using the MELD score must be judicious despite decompensation features affecting the patient's quality of life.

Patients with grade 3 ascites or overt hepatic encephalopathy have significant mortality risks; therefore, in some instances, these decompensation features should be considered indications for liver transplantation despite low MELD scores. The majority of patients listed for liver transplantation have low MELD scores (≤ 15 points), and approximately half will die due to liver-related complications. Evidence demonstrates a mortality reduction of approximately 40% with liver transplantation in those patients with a low MELD score.

Furthermore, new scores have been developed, such as the MELD 3.0, which incorporates female sex, albumin, and all the MELD-Na components (bilirubin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and sodium), and the Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation, which includes bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and the Royal Free Hospital glomerular filtration rate. These models have demonstrated improved discrimination. Lastly, to address the limited resource issue, living donor liver transplantation has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients even at MELD-Na scores as low as 11, suggesting that life-year gain could be achieved in low MELD scenarios.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^112m3NjJ]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations for the radiological diagnosis of HCC**: Non-invasive radiological criteria for the diagnosis of HCC are only applicable in cirrhotic patients (evidence high; recommendation strong). Non-invasive criteria can only be applied to nodules in a cirrhotic liver measuring 1 cm or more in diameter. Radiological assessment of HCC should be conducted with either multiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI, or a contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan. A CT or MR scan should be used initially due to the capability for analyzing the whole liver and greater sensitivity compared with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (evidence high; recommendation strong).

The non-invasive diagnosis of HCC is based on the identification of the typical hallmarks of HCC on multiphase CT or MR imaging. For lesions greater than 1 cm in size, these include the combination of hypervascularity in the late arterial phase (arterial phase hyperenhancement) and washout on portal venous and/or delayed phases. Depending on the exact size of a nodule, other hallmarks include threshold growth and capsule appearance. If these criteria are not present but HCC (or other malignancy) is considered probable, then a liver biopsy should be considered for diagnosis (evidence high; recommendation strong).

The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System classification system may be used to standardize reporting of radiological findings and guide further management (evidence moderate; recommendation moderate).

Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma with 6-monthly ultrasound (US) scans and α-fetoprotein (AFP) measurements should be considered in people with cirrhosis and certain subgroups of patients with chronic HBV infection (evidence strong, recommendation strong). The absolute risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the potential harms of surveillance should be discussed individually before a person is enrolled in surveillance (evidence moderate; recommendation strong). Surveillance is not recommended in patients who are unfit for cancer-specific therapy. Examples include those with decompensated cirrhosis (Child B8 or worse) who would not be candidates for liver transplant if HCC was diagnosed, and those with very impaired performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) category 2 or worse) (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).

- **Diagnosis of HCC**: Non-invasive radiological criteria for the diagnosis of HCC are only applicable in cirrhotic patients (evidence high; recommendation strong). Non-invasive criteria can only be applied to nodules in a cirrhotic liver measuring 1 cm or more in diameter. Radiological assessment of HCC should be with either multiphase CT, multiphase MRI, or contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan. A CT or MR scan should be used initially due to imaging of the whole liver and greater sensitivity compared with contrast-enhanced US (evidence high; recommendation strong). The non-invasive diagnosis of HCC is based on the identification of the typical hallmarks of HCC on multiphase CT or MR imaging.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^114C4ewV]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Surgical resection is a critical aspect of potentially curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surgical resection and liver transplantation achieve the best results in appropriately selected candidates, with 5-year survival rates of 60% or higher. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver, accounting for approximately 5% of cases in Western nations and up to 40% in Asia. In non-cirrhotic patients, major liver resections can be performed with acceptable outcomes, showing 5-year survival rates of up to 50%.

Liver transplantation might play a role in highly selected patients, such as those experiencing recurrence after initial resection or with unresectable disease at presentation. Defining optimal candidates for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver involves a multiparametric assessment of liver function matched to the presence of portal hypertension, oncological staging of the tumor, extent of hepatectomy, future liver remnant after optimal resection, and the potential for a laparoscopic or minimally invasive approach. Additionally, the projected outcome must be evaluated against other treatment modalities. In principle, resection should be considered for all those with non-metastatic disease and compensated cirrhosis without clinically significant portal hypertension. However, in practice, only a minority of patients will achieve acceptable perioperative and postoperative outcomes with equivalence or superiority to other treatments.

Initially, among cirrhotic patients in Western countries, the best candidates were defined as those with: a satisfactory liver function, absence of portal hypertension, and other favorable factors.

### Can the dropout risk of candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma predict survival after liver transplantation [^115DDXpt]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

In the last US national conference on liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a continuous priority score that incorporates the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), alpha-fetoprotein, and tumor size was recommended to ensure more equitable liver allocation. However, prioritizing the highest alpha-fetoprotein levels or largest tumors may select lesions at a higher risk for recurrence. Similarly, patients with a higher degree of liver failure may have lower postoperative survival.

Data from 300 adult HCC recipients were reviewed, and the proposed HCC-MELD equation was applied to verify if it can predict post-transplantation survival. The 5-year survival and recurrence rates after transplantation were 72.8% and 13.5%, respectively. Cox regression analysis confirmed HCC-MELD as predictive of both postoperative survival and recurrence (p < 0.001).

The 5-year predicted survival and recurrence rates were plotted against the HCC-MELD-based dropout probability: the higher the dropout probability while on the waiting list, the lower the predicted survival after transplantation, which is worsened by hepatitis C positivity; similarly, the higher the predicted HCC recurrence rate after transplantation. The HCC priority score could predict postoperative survival of HCC recipients and could be useful in selecting patients with greater possibilities of survival, resulting in higher post-transplantation survival rates of HCC populations.

HCC is an important global cause of cancer-related death. In the majority of patients, there are well-characterised and potentially reversible risk factors for its development. If patients are diagnosed at an early stage, treatment options associated with substantial benefit are available. It is particularly frustrating, therefore, that the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, including in the UK where a significant proportion are diagnosed via the emergency medicine pathway. Regrettably, this reflects a neglect of liver disease and cancer surveillance at a national level. It is pleasing to see that this is being addressed in various forums, including the Lancet Commission and the work of charities such as the British Liver Trust.

The major recent therapeutic advances relate to systemic therapies. The treatment landscape has completely changed for those with advanced-stage disease.

The final message has to be that HCC remains a scourge and a tragedy. A scourge in that survival remains poor, despite the availability of radical treatment options. A tragedy in that the disease is preventable in the majority of cases, at least in principle. It is hoped that national policies will reflect the unacceptability of the situation.

### Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis improves outcome [^115adN5b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation has become an effective treatment for cirrhotic patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. We hypothesized that the quality of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma influences prognosis by affecting access to liver transplantation.

A total of 269 patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were retrospectively categorized into three groups according to quality of surveillance: standard-of-care (n = 172) (group 1); substandard surveillance (n = 48) (group 2); and absence of surveillance in patients not recognized to be cirrhotic (n = 59) (group 3).

Three-year survival in the 60 patients who underwent liver transplantation was 81% versus 12% for patients who did not undergo transplantation (p < 0.001). The percentages of patients who underwent transplantation according to tumor stage at diagnosis (T1, T2, T3, and T4) were 58%, 35%, 10%, and 1%, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 in 70% of patients in group 1, 37% of patients in group 2, and only 18% of patients in group 3 (p < 0.001). Liver transplantation was performed in 32% of patients in group 1, 13% of patients in group 2, and 7% of patients in group 3 (p < 0.001).

Three-year survival from cancer diagnosis in patients in group 3 (12%) was significantly worse than in patients in group 1 (39%) or group 2 (27%) (each p < 0.05). Eighty percent of patients in group 3 had subtle abnormalities of cirrhosis on routine laboratory tests.

The quality of surveillance has a direct impact on hepatocellular carcinoma stage at diagnosis.

### A critical evaluation of hepatic resection in cirrhosis: Optimizing patient selection and outcomes [^115pEs5D]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatic resection has long been the mainstay of treatment for primary liver cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the high incidence of cirrhosis in patients with HCC, the use of resection was initially limited by the ability of the cirrhotic liver to sustain the surgical insult and the mass reduction. Today, hepatectomy in cirrhosis is undergoing a remarkable evolution. Although surgical and anesthetic improvements have increased the safety of this option, the rapid development of alternative therapies has decreased the need for it. Local excision for small HCC is likely to be replaced by image-guided, percutaneous ablative techniques. Furthermore, total replacement of a cirrhotic liver may be a more effective long-term cure than resection. Unquestionably, resection remains the optimal approach for patients with large tumors and healthy underlying liver function. The role of rapidly evolving new approaches will remain the subject of intensive inquiry in the years to come. In this report, we have attempted to clarify practices with respect to the evaluation, selection, and technique of resection in cirrhosis, and identify areas of active inquiry.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^112Vk9hU]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver (evidence moderate; recommendation strong). The assessment for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver involves a multiparametric evaluation considering liver function linked to severity of portal hypertension, extent of hepatectomy, volume of future liver remnant, as well as the patient's comorbidity profile and performance status (evidence high; recommendation strong). Surgical resection is considered a first-line treatment for solitary HCC in a cirrhotic liver of any size when liver function is maintained and an adequate remnant liver volume can be preserved (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).

Laparoscopic resection of tumors should be recommended in suitable patients (evidence moderate; recommendation weak). Clinical scenarios where resection may be considered include multifocal disease in patients not suitable for liver transplant, tumors associated with vascular invasion (highly selected cases), and after rupture of HCC into the peritoneal cavity (evidence weak; recommendation weak). Adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab improves recurrence-free survival, but longer-term follow-up is required (evidence moderate; recommendation moderate).

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^115GY7Nu]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

The Milan criteria (MC) remain the benchmark, although some feel they are too restrictive in potentially excluding patients who might benefit from a transplant. Several groups have reported results from using extended criteria. In general, if purely morphologic criteria are applied, survival after liver transplant (LT) decreases with increasing tumor size and number. However, modest expansion can achieve post-LT survival comparable to that with the MC, as is the case with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) or up-to-seven criteria.

In order to identify those who will benefit most from a transplant, particularly those beyond MC, newer selection criteria commonly include surrogates of tumor biology in addition to morphology. High alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels have been consistently identified as a negative predictor of post-LT outcomes, independent of tumor morphology. Tumor progression through, or response to, locoregional treatment also reflects tumor biology. The most widely used and validated criteria incorporating surrogates of biology are the French AFP model and the Metroticket 2.0 model.

The UK criteria for transplant are essentially a modest expansion of MC, with incorporation of some aspects of tumor biology in the form of an absolute AFP cut-off point and response to locoregional therapy for larger solitary tumors (which would otherwise be excluded from transplant):

- **One lesion < 5 cm in diameter**
- **Up to five lesions, maximum lesion diameter 3 cm**
- **Single tumors 5–7 cm in diameter with no progression over 6 months**
- **AFP level < 1000 ng/mL**

Reported outcomes using these criteria are similar to those for other established models.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^111FnjUD]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

No randomised controlled trials have compared the outcome of treatments in patients eligible for both transplant and resection. Traditionally, liver transplant has been the preferred approach for patients with multifocal disease, as it is considered to provide optimal oncological resection, treat underlying cirrhosis, and offer excellent long-term outcomes, including overall and recurrence-free survival. However, the applicability of transplants may be limited by organ shortages.

In the past decade, a number of studies have focused on determining the best approach for these patients. Two meta-analyses have evaluated this question. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as short-term (1-year) overall survival (OS), were worse for those treated with a transplant. A comparison of pooled 5-year OS shows that transplant was associated with better outcomes (63% liver transplant [LT] vs. 58% liver resection [LR] and 61% LT vs. 49% LR, respectively, for each study). It should be noted that disease recurrence after resection is high, with 5-year recurrence rates ranging from 18% to 72%.

- **Considerations for optimal therapy**: For multifocal disease within criteria, a transplant probably offers superior survival compared to resection. Resection may be considered in patients not suitable for a transplant. For a solitary nodule greater than 2 cm in diameter, a transplant likely provides the best long-term outcome. However, resection is a competitive treatment in carefully selected patients, offering good short-term outcomes. An individualised approach was emphasized in a study where both treatment strategies were considered.

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: A major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^115xtcAP]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, the MELD score has been implemented since 2002 as a method to prioritize access to liver transplantation. Most countries in Europe have adopted the principle of the "sickest first" to prioritize such access, also based on the MELD score, despite variations between countries. This principle is one of justice and has successfully reduced mortality rates for those on the waiting list in most countries. However, there are several inherent issues that must be addressed.

First, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, creatinine, and international normalized ratio levels, is not the holy grail. Some patients with severe liver diseases are poorly represented by the MELD score. For example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who have a low MELD score until the very late stage due to normal international normalized ratio and creatinine levels; patients with refractory ascites and otherwise preserved liver function; patients with chronic encephalopathy due to portacaval shunts; and patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome. These patients should be offered MELD exception points to provide them with the opportunity to access liver transplantation.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the BSG 2024 guidelines recommend applying noninvasive radiological criteria for diagnosing HCC only in patients with liver cirrhosis. Noninvasive criteria should be applied only for nodules in a cirrhotic liver measuring at least 1 cm in diameter. Radiological assessment of HCC should be obtained with multiphase CT, multiphase MRI, or contrast-enhanced ultrasound. For the initial assessment, CT or MRI is preferable due to their ability to image the entire liver and higher sensitivity compared to contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

The balance of evidence supports surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in people with cirrhosis and certain subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Surveillance should involve 6-monthly ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurements. There is no rationale for surveillance if a patient is unfit for cancer-specific treatments, due to liver dysfunction, comorbidities, or poor performance status.

- **Recommendations**:
	- HCC surveillance with 6-monthly US scan and AFP measurement should be considered in people with cirrhosis and certain subgroups of patients with chronic HBV infection (evidence strong; recommendation strong).
	- The absolute risk of HCC and the potential harms of surveillance should be discussed individually before a person is enrolled in surveillance (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
	- Surveillance is not recommended for patients unfit for cancer-specific therapy. Examples include those with decompensated cirrhosis who would not be candidates for liver transplant if HCC was diagnosed (Child's B8 or worse) and those with very impaired performance status (ECOG category 2 or worse) (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).

- **Diagnosis of HCC**:
	- The clinical context in which HCC is diagnosed includes:
	- An abnormality on surveillance investigation, such as a focal abnormality on liver US scan and/or elevated AFP.
	- Investigation of abnormal liver function, including hepatic decompensation.
	- Incidental findings during the investigation of a seemingly unrelated clinical issue.
	- A patient presenting with symptoms, such as abdominal pain.

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounting for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers. Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic tools, along with improved understanding of their application, are transforming patient treatment. Integrating these innovations into clinical practice presents challenges and necessitates guidance. These clinical practice guidelines offer updated advice for managing patients with HCC and provide a comprehensive review of pertinent data.

Key updates from the 2018 EASL guidelines include personalized surveillance based on individual risk assessment and the use of new tools. Additionally, there is standardization of liver imaging procedures and diagnostic criteria, use of minimally invasive surgery in complex cases together with updates on the integrated role of liver transplantation, transitions between surgical, locoregional, and systemic therapies, the role of radiation therapies, and the use of combination immunotherapies at various stages of disease. Above all, there is an absolute need for a multiparametric assessment of individual risks and benefits, considering the patient's perspective, by a multidisciplinary team encompassing various specialties.

### Evidence-based diagnosis, staging, and treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [^113ouS1M]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is key to their optimal care. For individuals at risk for HCC, surveillance usually involves ultrasonography, though there is controversy over the use of biomarkers. A diagnosis of HCC is made based on findings from biopsy or imaging analyses. Molecular markers are not used in diagnosis or determination of prognosis and treatment for these patients. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer algorithm is the most widely used staging system.

- **Early-stage cancer**: Patients with single liver tumors or up to 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm are classified as having very early or early-stage cancer and benefit from resection, transplantation, or ablation.

- **Intermediate-stage cancer**: Those with a greater tumor burden, confined to the liver, and who are free of symptoms are considered to have intermediate-stage cancer. They can benefit from chemoembolization if they still have preserved liver function.

- **Advanced-stage cancer**: Patients with symptoms of HCC and/or vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic cancer are considered to have advanced-stage cancer and could benefit from treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib.

- **End-stage cancer**: Patients with end-stage HCC have advanced liver disease that is not suitable for transplantation and/or have intense symptoms.

Studies now aim to identify molecular markers and imaging techniques that can detect patients with HCC at earlier stages and better predict their survival time and response to treatment.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^111AtnQP]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The purposes of cancer staging are to accurately predict a patient's prognosis and to determine the appropriate therapeutic intervention(s). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a somewhat unique tumor as it usually affects patients with underlying chronic liver disease. Both tumor burden and liver function need to be carefully evaluated at the time of prognostic prediction and treatment recommendation. Underlying liver disease and dysfunction significantly impact the chosen treatment and may limit life expectancy more than the cancer. Therefore, an optimal staging system for HCC must incorporate tumor burden, liver function, as well as the overall functional status of the patient.

- **Stratification systems**: Several groups have developed different systems or scores for stratifying patients with HCC. Numerous comparisons have been made, but due to varying patient selection criteria and preferred treatments in these published studies, no final conclusion about the optimal system has been reached.

- **BCLC classification**: The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification is endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and is widely used in Europe and North America, but not in Asia. This classification divides patients with HCC into five stages (0, A, B, C, and D) according to pre-established prognostic variables, and allocates recommended therapies.

For the UK population, disease staging according to the BCLC fulfills an important role for prognostication, but the recommended treatment algorithm has been found to be incomplete.

### Predicting the probability of progression-free survival in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma [^112nDhLp]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Allocation of cadaveric livers to patients based on such objective medical urgency data as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score may not benefit patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). To ensure that these patients have a fair opportunity of receiving a cadaveric organ, the risk for death caused by HCC and tumor progression beyond 5 cm should be considered. Using a Markov model, two hypothetical cohorts of patients with small hepatomas were assumed to have either (1) Gompertzian tumor growth, in which initial exponential growth decreases as tumor size increases; or (2) rapid exponential growth. The model tracked the number of patients who either died or had tumor progression beyond 5 cm. These results were used to back-calculate an equivalent MELD score for patients with small HCCs. All probabilities in the model were varied simultaneously using a Monte Carlo simulation.

The Gompertzian growth model predicted that patients with a 1- and 4-cm tumor have 1-year progression-free survival rates of 70% (HCC-specific MELD score 6) and 66% (HCC-specific MELD score 8), respectively. When assuming rapid exponential growth, patients with a 1- and 4-cm tumor have progression-free survival rates of 69% (HCC-specific MELD score 6) and 12% (HCC-specific MELD score 24), respectively. Our model predicted that the risk for death caused by HCC or tumor progression beyond 5 cm should increase with larger initial tumor size in patients with small hepatomas. To ensure that these patients have a fair opportunity to receive a cadaveric organ, HCC-specific scores predict an appropriate assessment of urgency.

### Current management of hepatocellular cancer [^11759TP5]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver, ranking as the fifth most frequent cancer worldwide. It typically occurs in the context of chronic liver disease and carries a poor prognosis if left untreated. Following diagnosis, HCC necessitates a multidisciplinary management approach.

Orthotopic liver transplantation is theoretically the optimal treatment for early, unresectable HCC. However, the significant limitation is the extreme shortage of organs, which makes this treatment a feasible option only for selected patients. In this report, we describe recent advancements in the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of HCC that have emerged in the field.

### Increased long-term survival among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after implementation of model for end-stage liver disease score [^1153Eoow]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Assignment of Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception points to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who fall within Milan criteria, which began in 2003, increases their priority on liver transplantation waitlists. However, little is known about how this change affected survival of all patients with HCC (transplant eligible and ineligible). We compared long-term survival of HCC patients before and after this change.

- **Methods**: We performed a large population-based cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry to investigate survival times of patients with HCC before those who met the Milan criteria were given MELD exception points (1998–2003) and afterward (2004–2010) using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models evaluated independent predictors of survival.

- **Results**: During 2004–2010, a significantly higher percentage of patients with HCC survived for 5 years compared with 1998–2003 (21.9% vs. 13.0%, P < .001). This difference remained significant among all treatment groups (no therapy: 15.2% vs. 10.2%, P < .001; local tumor destruction: 37.6% vs. 22.1%, P < .001; resection: 55.5% vs. 39.2%, P < .001; transplantation: 77.2% vs. 73.1%, P = 0.12). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, inclusive of sex, age, ethnicity, Milan criteria, number and stage of tumor, and time period, showed increased survival of patients during 2004–2010 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.91; P < .001). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Asians (HR, 0.81; 95% CI…

### The sequential changes of the model for end-stage liver disease score correlate with the severity of liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing locoregional therapy [^116BUZix]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used to prioritize cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation. It is not clear whether MELD correlates with liver functional reserve that changes over time. This study investigated the correlation of sequential changes between MELD and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

- **Methods**: A total of 192 HCC patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization or percutaneous injection therapy were studied.

- **Results**: The MELD and CTP scores of study patients at pretreatment, early (median, 2 weeks), and late (median, 8 weeks) stage after treatment were 10.1 ± 3.5, 12.9 ± 3.2, and 11.7 ± 3.1, and 6.2 ± 1.1, 7.5 ± 1.1, and 6.9 ± 1.2, respectively. There was a significant correlation of the serial changes for the period between pretreatment and early stage (rho = 0.605, P < 0.001) and between pretreatment and late stage (rho = 0.554, P < 0.001). Larger tumor size > 5 cm (relative risk (RR) = 2.58, P < 0.001) and MELD score > 15 (RR = 2.17, P = 0.023) were independent poor prognostic predictors.

- **Conclusions**: Serial determinations of the MELD score well correlate with the changes of the CTP score. The MELD score may be useful in measuring liver functional reserve and outcome.

### Hepatectomy as treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma in elderly cirrhotic patients [^117DsYMX]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

In recent decades, liver resection has become a safe procedure; however, the outcome of hepatectomies in aged cirrhotic patients is often uncertain. To elucidate early and long-term outcomes of hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the elderly, we studied 241 cirrhotic patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between 1985 and 2003. According to their age at the time of surgery, patients were divided into two groups: those aged over 70 years (64 patients) and those aged 70 years or younger (177 patients).

Operative mortality was 3.1% in the elderly group and 9.6% in the younger group (p = 0.113). Postoperative morbidity and liver failure rates were higher in the younger group (42.4% versus 23.4%, p = 0.0073; 12.9% versus 1.6%, p = 0.0065). Five-year survival rates were 48.6% in the elderly group and 32.3% in the younger group (p = 0.081). Considering only radical resections in Child-Pugh A patients, survival remained similar in the two groups (p = 0.072). Disease-free survival was not different between the two groups. A survival analysis performed according to tumor diameter showed better survival for elderly Child-Pugh A patients with HCC larger than 5 cm that was radically resected (50.8% versus 16.1% 5-year survival, p = 0.034).

In univariate analysis, tumor size was not a prognostic factor in the elderly, whereas younger patients with large tumors had a worse outcome. Age by itself is not a contraindication for surgery, and selected cirrhotic patients with HCC who are 70 years of age or older could benefit from resection, even in the presence of large tumors. The long-term results of liver resections for HCC in the elderly demonstrate this potential benefit.

### Impact of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score on prognosis after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis [^115dDMS1]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to predict postoperative liver failure and morbidity after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhosis. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is currently accepted as a disease severity index of cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation; however, its impact on prognosis after resection of HCC on cirrhosis has never been investigated.

One hundred fifty-four cirrhotic patients resected in a tertiary care setting for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. For each patient, the MELD score was calculated and related to postoperative liver failure and complications (morbidity). Hospital stay and 1-year survival were also investigated. MELD accuracy in predicting postoperative liver failure and morbidity of cirrhotic patients was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Eleven patients (7.1%) experienced postoperative liver failure leading to death or transplantation. ROC analysis identified cirrhotic patients with a MELD score equal to or above 11 at high risk for postoperative liver failure (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87–0.96; sensitivity = 82%; specificity = 89%). Forty-six patients (29.9%) developed at least one postoperative complication. ROC analysis identified patients with a MELD score equal to or above 9 at major risk for postoperative complications (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78–0.89; sensitivity = 87%; specificity = 63%).

Cirrhotic patients with a MELD score below 9 had no postoperative liver failure and low morbidity (8.1%). In conclusion, the MELD score is an effective tool for predicting postoperative liver failure and complications in cirrhotic patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^1111Z4Fo]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

The role of biopsy for the diagnosis and management of HCC has changed over time. Recent guidelines reserve biopsy for focal lesions in cirrhotic liver that remain indeterminate by imaging and for focal lesions in non-cirrhotic liver, where the main differential diagnosis is metastatic cancer.

The increasing use of molecular pathology in HCC diagnosis and evidence that molecular markers may be used to stratify patients for targeted therapeutic trials, to more accurately determine prognosis and predict resistance to immunotherapy, have led to a reconsideration of the role of biopsy in HCC management and a proactive biopsy strategy in research settings. On the other hand, liver biopsy, despite its high sensitivity and specificity for HCC diagnosis, might have complications, although at a lower rate than previously shown. These include bleeding, which might be severe in 0.5% of cases, and tumor seeding in 2.7% of cases.

Nevertheless, in a retrospective study of 309 patients with transplantable HCC, preoperative tumor biopsy did not alter the oncological course of patients with HCC and, in 4% of cases, changed the diagnosis. Moreover, tumor seeding reportedly has no impact on the outcome for patients with HCC. Clinical guidelines leave the option of liver biopsy open for selected patients, center-based treatment programs, or recommend it for clinical trials based on national or institutional policy. In the UK, biopsy is used for confirming diagnosis in patients with advanced HCC eligible for treatment with systemic therapy, independent of tumor size or imaging findings.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114TagEg]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have witnessed major changes over the past decade. Until the early 1990s, HCC was a relatively rare malignancy, typically diagnosed at an advanced stage in a symptomatic patient, and there were no known effective palliative or therapeutic options. However, the rising incidence of HCC in several regions around the world, coupled with emerging evidence for the efficacy of screening in high-risk patients, liver transplantation as a curative option in select patients, the ability to make a definitive diagnosis using high-resolution imaging of the liver, less dependency on obtaining tissue diagnosis, and the proven efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib as palliative therapy have improved the outlook for HCC patients. In this article, we present a summary of the most recent information on screening, diagnosis, staging, and different treatment modalities of HCC, as well as our recommended management approach.

### Multidisciplinary management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^111m2Tek]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. Management algorithms are continually increasing in sophistication and involve the application of single and multimodality treatments, including liver transplantation, hepatic resection, ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, radioembolization, and systemic chemotherapy. These treatments have been shown to increase survival times. As many as 75% of patients with limited-stage disease who are given curative therapies survive 5 years, whereas less than 20% of untreated patients survive 1 year. Treatment can be optimized based on the patient's tumor stage, hepatic reserve, and functional status. However, because of the heterogeneity in presentation among patients, a multidisciplinary approach is required to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, involving hepatologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and oncologists. We present each specialist's viewpoint on controversies and advances in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Determination of the optimal model for end-stage liver disease score in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing loco-regional therapy [^1161CWnK]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been a prevailing system to prioritize cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation. An "exceptional" MELD score of 20 and 24 points is assigned for stage T1 and T2 patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. However, this strategy is based on scarce data, and the optimal score for these patients remains uncertain.

We investigated 238 patients with small HCC who were candidates for liver transplantation and underwent arterial chemoembolization or percutaneous injection therapy using acetic acid or ethanol. Tumor stage (P = 0.001) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class (P < .001) were independent risk factors predicting tumor progression or death in survival analysis. The risk of disease progression in HCC patients stratified by tumor stage was mapped and equated with the risk of mortality of 456 cirrhotic patients without HCC.

The 6- and 12-month rates of disease progression were 4% and 6%, respectively, for stage T1 HCC patients (n = 50; mean MELD: 9.5). These rates were close to and no higher than the mortality rate in MELD category 8–12 at the corresponding time period (7.1% and 11.3%, respectively; n = 141). For stage T2 patients (n = 188; mean MELD: 9.3), the corresponding rates were 5.3% and 13.8%, respectively, which were close to and no higher than the mortality rate in MELD category 10–14 (9.0% and 13.9%, respectively, n = 166).

In conclusion, the risk of disease progression is quite low for selected HCC patients undergoing loco-regional therapy. A lower MELD score may be suggested to be equivalent.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^116b69cS]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Staging systems for prognostication and treatment allocation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) need to incorporate tumor burden, underlying liver function, and performance status (evidence high, recommendation strong). The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system has been extensively validated and is the most widely used in Europe and the United States. It is recommended for staging and prognostication (evidence high, recommendation strong).

- **Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma**:

	- **Surgical resection**: Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver (evidence moderate; recommendation strong). The assessment for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver is a multiparametric evaluation considering liver function linked to the severity of portal hypertension, the extent of hepatectomy, the volume of future liver remnant, as well as the patient's comorbidity profile and performance status (evidence high; recommendation strong). Surgical resection is considered a first-line treatment for solitary HCC in a cirrhotic liver of any size when liver function is maintained, and an adequate remnant liver volume can be preserved (evidence moderate; recommendation strong). Laparoscopic resection of tumors should be recommended in suitable patients (evidence moderate; recommendation weak). Clinical scenarios where resection may be considered include multifocal disease in patients not suitable for liver transplant, tumors associated with vascular invasion (highly selected cases), and after the rupture of HCC into the peritoneal cavity.

### Management of Hcc [^1135Q2My]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent and lethal neoplasia, the management of which has significantly improved during the last few years. A better understanding of the natural history of the tumor and the development of staging systems that stratify patients according to the characteristics of the tumor, the liver disease, and the performance status, such as the BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) system, have led to better prediction of prognosis and more appropriate treatment approaches.

Today, curative therapies — such as resection, transplantation, and ablation — can improve survival in patients diagnosed at an early HCC stage and offer a potential long-term cure. Patients with intermediate-stage HCC benefit from chemoembolization, and those diagnosed at an advanced stage benefit from sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects. In this article, we review the management in HCC and the new advances in this field.

### Predicting morbidity and mortality after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: The role of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score [^112cuVL4]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is currently used as a disease severity index of cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation. This study evaluated the usefulness of the MELD score in predicting mortality and morbidity of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing hepatic resection.

- **Methods**: The study cohort consisted of 1,017 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC between 1991 and 2005. Patient variables were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses to identify risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Accuracy in predicting mortality was assessed with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.

- **Results**: The morbidity and mortality rates were 30.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Age, liver cirrhosis, operation time, and MELD score were risk factors for mortality, whereas indocyanine green retention rate at 15-minute value, operation time, blood loss, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score were risk factors for morbidity. Patients with a MELD score > 8 had higher mortality (4.0% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.004) and higher liver-related morbidities (16.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.015) compared to those with a MELD score < 6. The AUC for MELD score as a predictor of mortality was 0.718, indicating high clinical usefulness.

- **Conclusions**: The MELD score is associated with mortality and liver-related morbidities in HCC patients.

### Treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma [^113xRafx]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), closely associated with liver cirrhosis and the main cause of death in patients with such disease, is now recognized as one of the most prevalent and lethal neoplasms worldwide. Prognosis and allocation of the multiple available treatment options for patients with HCC are influenced not only by tumor stage but also by the degree of liver-function impairment. Therefore, accurate assessment and classification of disease is important for patient management.

According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm, intermediate-stage HCC is defined as extensive multifocal disease without vascular invasion in patients with preserved liver function and an absence of cancer-related symptoms. In this context, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered the standard treatment. The use of drug-eluting beads has enabled standardization of this procedure, resulting in higher reproducibility and tolerability of the treatment.

Nevertheless, not all patients with intermediate-stage HCC are good candidates for TACE. For such patients, in whom TACE is not appropriate or has failed, other treatments can be considered, including sorafenib. Radioembolization is a promising alternative that deserves further prospective studies.

Herein, we review the approaches used to accurately stratify patients with intermediate-stage HCC and subsequently allocate the most appropriate treatments. The key developments in therapeutic strategies are also discussed.

Regarding the medical management of hepatocellular carcinoma, specifically concerning the management of early disease through local ablation, the ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of microwave ablation or radiofrequency ablation. This is advised for solitary tumors 3–5 cm in diameter or for multifocal disease (≤ 3 tumors, each ≤ 3 cm) in patients who are at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A. Such management is applicable for patients ineligible for surgical resection or as a bridge to orthotopic liver transplantation.
