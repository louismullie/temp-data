## Question

What do the ACC/AHA Guidelines say about Beta Blockers for treatment of Hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ACC/AHA guidelines say about using beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current ACC/AHA guideline position on first-line therapy. Then, I should verify the rationale for restricting beta-blockers. Next, I will identify the compelling indications where beta-blockers are still recommended. After that, I need to check special populations and safety considerations. Finally, I will compare this stance with other societies and synthesize practical implications for practice, making sure I anchor each point to the highest-quality sources available.

> Let me first confirm the current ACC/AHA position. The 2025 ACC/AHA/AANP guideline explicitly recommends thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs as the four first-line classes for adults initiating pharmacologic therapy for primary hypertension, and it states that beta-blockers should be reserved for compelling indications rather than used as initial therapy, reflecting inferior stroke prevention and tolerability concerns identified in meta-analyses and RCTs [^77050566] [^64664da1].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale before moving on. The restriction stems from comparative effectiveness data showing beta-blockers are less effective than first-line classes at preventing stroke and have a less favorable side-effect profile, with much of the outcome data derived from traditional agents like atenolol; vasodilating beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol may have different hemodynamic profiles, but mortality and cardiovascular event data are lacking for these newer agents in uncomplicated hypertension, so they do not change the first-line recommendation at this time [^77050566] [^5354f39c] [^569a5fcd].

> I need to check the compelling indications where beta-blockers remain appropriate. In chronic coronary disease with hypertension, beta-blockers are first-line when there is a compelling indication such as recent myocardial infarction or angina, and they are also indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and for thoracic aortic disease including acute aortic syndromes and Marfan-related aortopathy, where beta-blockers reduce aortic wall stress and adverse events; in these settings, guideline-directed beta-blocker therapy is recommended alongside other foundational agents as needed [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3] [^0f80f8aa] [^b2a30a6b] [^453afc48].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and safety nuances. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, beta-blockers are generally not recommended for hypertension management because negative chronotropy may worsen exercise intolerance, though they may be used for specific comorbid indications like atrial fibrillation or ischemia; in peripheral artery disease, beta-blockers do not worsen claudication and can be used when otherwise indicated; in reactive airway disease, nonselective beta-blockers should be avoided, and if a beta-blocker is necessary, a cardioselective agent may be considered with caution; abrupt withdrawal of chronic beta-blocker therapy can precipitate rebound hypertension and ischemia, so continuation with careful perioperative management is advised when already on therapy [^872e9176] [^e966be58] [^48ff6b97] [^4f7b39db] [^c04f767e] [^fb525988].

> Let me consider resistant hypertension algorithms, because I initially thought beta-blockers might be a routine fourth-line option; wait, I should double-check that. The ACC/AHA pathway prioritizes confirming true resistance, optimizing the triple foundation of ACEi/ARB, CCB, and thiazide(-like) diuretic, and then adding spironolactone as preferred fourth-line; if spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, adding a beta-blocker is reasonable, but it is not the default fourth-line choice, which corrects my earlier assumption [^d26700d2] [^5b424ac7].

> Next, I should review how this compares with other guidelines to ensure I'm not overstating uniqueness. The 2023 ESH/ESC guideline includes beta-blockers among major drug classes and permits their use at any treatment step, particularly when there are compelling indications such as coronary disease, heart failure, or rate control needs; this contrasts with ACC/AHA's restriction of beta-blockers to compelling indications for initial therapy, illustrating a deliberate divergence in first-line positioning despite overlapping indications in comorbid disease [^f398b97d] [^32f73825] [^29937ba2].

> I will now examine practical prescribing implications so I don't miss anything actionable. For uncomplicated hypertension, start with one of the four first-line classes and titrate or combine to reach blood pressure targets, generally less than 130/80 mm Hg in higher-risk adults; reserve beta-blockers for patients with coronary disease, HFrEF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or thoracic aortic disease; if a beta-blocker is already on board and there is no compelling indication, consider de-prescribing when feasible; and when using beta-blockers, prefer agents with evidence in the relevant comorbidity, such as carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol for HFrEF, and avoid abrupt cessation [^77050566] [^a74f1acf] [^0f80f8aa].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. ACC/AHA guidelines do not recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy for primary hypertension due to inferior stroke prevention and tolerability, and they should be reserved for compelling cardiovascular indications; when used, they should be aligned with disease-specific evidence and safety considerations, and clinicians should be prepared to adjust therapy as comorbidities evolve and as newer outcome data emerge [^77050566] [^5354f39c].

Beta-blockers are **not first-line** for hypertension unless there is a compelling indication (heart failure, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmia) [^77050566] [^64664da1]. They are **less effective than other classes** at preventing stroke and cardiovascular events, and are more often discontinued due to side effects [^5354f39c] [^fc5164bd]. Use beta-blockers when indicated by comorbidity, and prefer vasodilating agents (e.g. carvedilol, nebivolol) when needed [^a74f1acf] [^a3f3cfb6]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal to prevent rebound hypertension [^c04f767e] [^fb525988].

---

## Current ACC/AHA recommendations

The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and its updates recommend **four first-line classes** for hypertension: thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs [^77050566] [^64664da1]. Beta-blockers are **not first-line** unless there is a compelling indication such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmia [^77050566] [^64664da1].

---

## Rationale for not using beta-blockers first-line

The ACC/AHA position is based on evidence that beta-blockers are **less effective than other classes** at preventing stroke and cardiovascular events, and are more often discontinued due to side effects [^5354f39c] [^fc5164bd]. Meta-analyses show beta-blockers reduce cardiovascular events versus placebo but are inferior to calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors for major outcomes [^5354f39c] [^fc5164bd].

---

## Compelling indications for beta-blocker use

Beta-blockers remain indicated for hypertension when **compelling comorbidities** are present:

- **Heart failure**: Especially HFrEF, where beta-blockers reduce mortality and hospitalizations [^0f80f8aa].
- **Coronary artery disease**: Post-MI or angina, where beta-blockers reduce ischemia and events [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].
- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial fibrillation or other tachyarrhythmias requiring rate control [^cc544bd4] [^f398b97d].
- **Aortic disease**: Thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection, where beta-blockers reduce aortic wall stress [^b2a30a6b] [^453afc48].

---

## Specific beta-blocker agents and considerations

When beta-blockers are used, **vasodilating agents** (e.g. carvedilol, nebivolol) are preferred due to better tolerability and metabolic profiles [^a74f1acf] [^a3f3cfb6]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal to prevent rebound hypertension [^c04f767e] [^fb525988].

---

## Comparison with other guidelines

The ACC/AHA stance contrasts with the 2023 ESH guidelines, which include beta-blockers among **first-line options** for hypertension, citing comparable blood pressure lowering and cardiovascular protection in many patients [^f398b97d] [^32f73825]. This discrepancy reflects differing interpretations of the evidence and guideline priorities [^29937ba2].

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

Clinicians should:

- **Reserve beta-blockers**: Use only for compelling indications or intolerance to first-line agents [^77050566] [^64664da1].
- **Prefer vasodilating beta-blockers**: Carvedilol or nebivolol when beta-blockers are indicated [^a74f1acf] [^a3f3cfb6].
- **Monitor for side effects**: Fatigue, bradycardia, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic effects [^27cb8791] [^569a5fcd].
- **Avoid abrupt withdrawal**: Taper gradually to prevent rebound hypertension [^c04f767e] [^fb525988].

---

Beta-blockers are **not first-line** for hypertension unless there is a compelling indication; they are less effective than other classes for stroke prevention and are more often discontinued. Use them when indicated by comorbidity, prefer vasodilating agents, and avoid abrupt withdrawal.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^c6e1cd72]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA and ESH guidelines recommend initial treatment with antihypertensive agents from at least 1 of 4 major classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The ESH guideline continues to recommend beta-blockers as an optional first-line therapy for several CV and many non-CV conditions, including atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while the American guideline only recommends them for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure.The ESH guideline points to several randomized control trials and meta-analyses that show beta-blockers significantly reduce major CVD events when compared to placebo.

Initiation of combination therapy with medications from different classes is also prominent in both guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends an initial two-drug regimen for patients with "stage 2 hypertension” and BP > 20/10 mm Hg above target, and for Black patients (COR I, LOE: C-EO), while ESH recommends initial therapy with a two-drug combination regimen for most patients with hypertension (COR I, LOE: A). ESH strongly advocates for single-pill combination therapy to improve medication adherence and achieve BP control, while the U.S. guideline recommends either single-pill combination or multi-pill combinations.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^80bf8bdd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guideline recommendations regarding β-blocker use for first-line treatment of high blood pressure (BP) have changed significantly over the past 3 decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials demonstrated their efficacy to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, leading to first-line endorsement alongside thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (hereafter, thiazides) in the Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC6 and JNC7, respectively).,, This changed in 2014 with the Eighth JNC Report (JNC8) recommending β-blockers as first-line only for patients with “compelling indications” supported by strong evidence of benefit.In the absence of such compelling indications, β-blockers were relegated to second-line therapy after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). This shift was based on trials and meta-analyses suggesting inferior stroke and mortality as well as higher discontinuation rates from adverse effects.,,,, Similar recommendations appeared in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) BP guidelines and were reinforced in the 2024 AHA/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke. In contrast, the 2018 and 2023 updates of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines supported first-line β-blocker use for uncomplicated hypertension, citing their efficacy compared with placebo in lowering BP and preventing CVD.

The quality of hypertension care for US veterans has been a major focus of the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated health care system in the US. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2004, 2014, and 2020 conformed with the recommendations outlined in the JNC7, JNC8, and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, in our recent analyses,we identified that β-blockers are prescribed as first-line hypertension treatment in approximately 20% of veterans who do not have a compelling indication, although this trend decreased over the 20-year study. To improve evidence-based prescribing of β-blockers for treatment of high BP, we sought to investigate the clinical factors associated with β-blocker use in a cohort of veterans initiating treatment for high BP over 23 years.

### Are beta blockers effective first-line treatments for... [^aebe444f]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 55-year-old woman presents with new-onset hypertension. Clinical Question Should beta blockers be used as first-line treatments for lowering blood pressure. Evidence-Based Answer Current evidence does not support the use of beta blockers as initial therapy for hypertension. In addition, these systematic reviews did not assess the tolerability of beta blockers relative to other antihypertensive medications. Thus, we undertook this review to reassess the place of beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension compared with other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. Objectives: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of beta blockers on morbidity and mortality end points in adults with hypertension. The risk of total cardiovascular disease was lower for first-line beta blockers compared with placebo inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for heart failure, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for diabetes.
1.

Lifetime risk of coronary heart disease and stroke is directly related to higher blood pressure 5; therefore, the primary reason for treating hypertension is to reduce morbidity and mortality from these conditions. Generic beta blockers are inexpensive and may seem appealing as initial antihypertensive therapy; however, this Cochrane review supports the JNC 7 recommendation to begin medical treatment of high blood pressure with thiazide diuretics. ALLHAT demonstrated that thiazide diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors for reducing cardiovascular risk. 6.

### ACC / AHA versus ESC / ESH on hypertension Guidelines: JACC guideline comparison [^a17ca802]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study compares the recommendations of the most recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) blood pressure guidelines. Both guidelines represent updates of previous guidelines and reinforce previous concepts of prevention regarding elevated blood pressure. Specifically, a low-sodium diet, exercise, body weight reduction, low to moderate alcohol intake, and adequate potassium intake are emphasized. Overall, both guidelines agree on the proper method of blood pressure measurement, the use of home blood pressure and ambulatory monitoring, and restricted use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy. The major disagreements are with the level of blood pressure defining hypertension, flexibility in identifying blood pressure targets for treatment, and the use of initial combination therapy. Although initial single-pill combination therapy is strongly recommended in both guidelines, the ESC/ESH guideline recommends it as initial therapy in patients at ≥140/90 mm Hg. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends its use in patients >20/10 mm Hg above blood pressure goal. Thus, the only real disagreement is that the ACC/AHA guidelines maintain that all people with blood pressure >130/80 mm Hg have hypertension, and blood pressure should be lowered to <130/80 mm Hg in all. In contrast, the ESC/ESH guidelines state that hypertension is defined as >140/90 mm Hg, with the goal being a level <140/90 mm Hg for all targeting to <130/80 mm Hg only in those at high cardiovascular risk, but always considering individual tolerability of the proposed goal.

Hypertension—beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity include acebutolol 200-800 with daily frequency 2, penbutolol 10-40 with daily frequency 1, and pindolol 10-60 with daily frequency 2; generally avoid, especially in patients with CHD or HF, and avoid abrupt cessation.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^c4051929]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A major difference between guidelines is the recommendation of renal denervation therapy for hypertension treatment by the 2023 ESH guideline (COR II, LOE: B), which is absent from the ACC/AHA guideline. Renal denervation therapy is a device-based treatment intended for patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension (after excluding secondary hypertension) as either an additional or alternative therapy to increasing medication burden.

The updated 2023 ESH BP guideline is a comprehensive resource for hypertension management. The changes highlighted in this review demonstrate that the recommendations of the U.S. and European guidelines continue to harmonize. Both emphasize proper BP measurement technique, advise use of ASCVD risk assessment tools for treatment decisions, and recommend similar classes of antihypertensive therapies. The guidelines continue to differ in BP classification, hypertension definition, BP targets for older adults, and beta-blocker and device-based treatment strategies. Overall, there is strong agreement that for most people, especially those at highest ASCVD risk, BP < 130/80 mm Hg should be encouraged.

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy—In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130-139 mm Hg and DBP 80-89 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control.

Perioperative hypertension management—beta blockers (BB) and clonidine: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, with continuation through hospitalization and at discharge unless contraindications arise. Abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and data are fewer on whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful. Special consideration is noted for patients taking clonidine or BB because stopping these medications acutely carries risk, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can cause rebound hypertension with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and without plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension—For adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and HTN (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

### Individualized beta-blocker treatment for high blood pressure dictated by medical comorbidities: indications beyond the 2018 European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^da498496]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Several hypertension guidelines have removed beta-blockers from their previous position as first-choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension. However, this downgrading may not be justified by available evidence because beta-blockers lower blood pressure as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs and have solid documentation in preventing cardiovascular complications. Suspected inconveniences of beta-blockers such as increased risk of depression or erectile dysfunction may have been overemphasized, while patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral artery disease, that is, conditions in which their use was previously restricted, will benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Besides, evidence that from early to late phases, hypertension is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system makes beta-blockers pathophysiologically an appropriate treatment in hypertension. Beta-blockers have favorable effects on a variety of clinical conditions that may coexist with hypertension, making their use either as specific treatment or as co-treatment potentially common in clinical practice. Guidelines typically limit recommendations on specific beta-blocker use to cardiac conditions including angina pectoris, postmyocardial infarction, or heart failure, with little or no mention of the additional cardiovascular or noncardiovascular conditions in which these drugs may be needed or preferred. In the present narrative review, we focus on multiple additional diseases and conditions that may occur and affect patients with hypertension, often more frequently than people without hypertension, and that may favor the choice of beta-blocker. Notwithstanding, beta-blockers represent an in-homogenous group of drugs and choosing beta-blockers with documented effect in prevention and treatment of disease is important for first choice in guidelines.

Table 26—labetalol (adrenergic blockers—combined alpha-1 and nonselective beta receptor antagonist) for hypertensive emergencies lists “Initial 0.3-1.0 mg/kg dose (maximum 20 mg) slow IV injection over 2 min or 0.4-1.0 mg/kg/h IV infusion up to 3 mg/kg/h. Adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 300 mg/24 h,” with cautions: “Contraindicated in reactive airway or obstructive pulmonary disease. Especially useful in hyperadrenergic syndromes. May worsen HF and should not be given in patients with second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia.”

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and hypertension—management emphasizes diuretics for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload; RAASi are indicated to attain an SBP of <130 mm Hg (especially with an MRA or ARNI, or an ARB when ARNI is not feasible); beta-blockers (BB) are not recommended for hypertension management and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions (eg, arrhythmia, ACS); and SGLT2i are frequently used to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality and may lower BP, warranting adjustment of other agents if hypotension occurs.

Resistant hypertension—core management recommendations state that, in adults with resistant hypertension, a more detailed evaluation for secondary causes, including careful review of all medications and removal of those with interfering effects on BP, is beneficial for lowering BP and simplifying treatment (class 1, level B-NR). In adults with uncontrolled resistant hypertension who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to MRA, adding one of the following agents or classes—amiloride, BBs, alpha-blockers, central sympathetic drugs, dual endothelin receptor antagonists, or direct vasodilators—is reasonable to control BP (class 2a, level B-R).

Hypertension treatment thresholds and use of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk—In all adults with hypertension, initiation of medications to lower blood pressure (BP) is recommended when average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, and initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average DBP is ≥ 90 mm Hg. In adults with hypertension and clinical CVD, initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average SBP is ≥ 130 mm Hg, and when average DBP is ≥ 80 mm Hg, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk related to blood pressure in adults—Once BP is above normal (SBP ≥120 mm Hg or DBP ≥80 mm Hg), there may be irreversible vascular damage and residual risk, even if antihypertensive treatment is started. Among middle-aged and older adults, the prevalence and risks associated with higher SBP are greater than those associated with higher DBP, and relative risks for CVD associated with BP attenuate somewhat, but absolute CVD rates are substantially higher at older compared with younger ages. Individuals with a diagnosis of hypertension who have treated SBP/DBP levels <120/80 mm Hg have twice the risk for CVD of adults without hypertension who have untreated SBP/DBP levels <120/80 mm Hg.

Chronic coronary disease—blood pressure management recommendations: For adults with chronic coronary disease (CCD) and elevated blood pressure, nonpharmacologic strategies are a Class 1, Level A recommendation as first-line therapy for elevated BP defined as 120-129/<80 mm Hg. For adults with CCD who have hypertension, a Class 1, Level B-R recommendation targets <130/<80 mm Hg to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause death. For adults with CCD and hypertension, defined as systolic BP ≥130 and/or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg, in addition to nonpharmacological strategies, guideline-directed ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta blockers are recommended as first-line therapy for compelling indications such as recent MI or angina, with add-on agents including dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as needed to optimize BP control.

Hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)—Treat as per the current ACC/AHA guidelines for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults and target systolic BP <130 mm Hg. In participants with hypertension without HF, a more intensive intervention targeting systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg significantly reduced the incidence of HF by 38%. Most individuals with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive agents, and an investigation of secondary causes of hypertension may be indicated in some individuals with refractory hypertension despite 4 agents, including a diuretic agent; beta-blockers should generally be avoided given the negative chronotropic effects that may reduce tolerability in HFpEF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Hypertension—prevention of heart failure (HF) is emphasized: optimal blood pressure control decreases the risk of new HF by approximately 50%, and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension in the United States exceeds 75%. In the Framingham Heart Study, hypertension accounted for 39% of HF cases in men and 59% in women, and among patients who have had a prior MI, benefits include an 81% reduction in the incidence of HF. Healthcare providers should lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in accordance with published guidelines, and target levels of blood pressure are lower in patients with associated major cardiovascular risk factors, especially those with diabetes mellitus. Diuretic-based antihypertensive therapy has repeatedly been shown to prevent HF; ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers are also effective in the prevention of HF, whereas calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing HF syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) losartan and irbesartan significantly reduced the incidence of HF.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to treat adults with stable ischemic heart disease and HTN (BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg) with medications for compelling indications (such as β-blockers, ACEis, or ARBs for previous myocardial infarction or stable angina) as first-line therapy, with the addition of other drugs (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to further control HTN.

### Beta-blockers for primary prevention in hypertension: era bygone? [^959e3ab0]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are used commonly worldwide in clinical practice for lowering blood pressure. Most of the agents in this class are efficacious in reducing blood pressure, although they vary widely in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This variability may confer significant differences in clinical benefits associated with use of specific agents. Although commonly used in managing hypertension, the role of beta-blockers for primary prevention in uncomplicated hypertension has been controversial. Evidence from recent trials suggest relatively poor efficacy toward primary prevention and worse outcomes for certain end points, when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents, Recently updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for England and Wales reflect this concern and have changed the indication for beta-blockers for blood pressure control from primary agents to use as an add-on agent in patients requiring multiple therapy. In this review, considering the extended debate on this topic, we discuss the general properties of beta-blockers and evidence from clinical trials supporting or refuting their use in various clinical scenarios. Newer beta-blockers have additional properties which may be beneficial. Although, whether these additional benefits will help in primary prevention is not clear.

Sexual dysfunction in hypertension—synopsis states that sexual dysfunction frequently occurs in individuals with hypertension and has been more commonly reported by women than men, and it is defined as a person’s inability to participate in sexual relationships as they would wish with assessment using sex-specific validated tools covering domains including thoughts and desires, arousal, frequency of sexual activity, pleasure and orgasm, and problems affecting sexual function. The association between hypertension and sexual dysfunction may be due to shared mechanistic pathways of impaired vascular function and atherosclerosis in addition to common risk factors such as increasing age, hormonal shifts, diabetes, and depression, and antihypertensive medications may also contribute because treated patients with hypertension are more likely to report sexual dysfunction than untreated ones. Discussing sexual function with patients is essential as concerns about antihypertensive medications’ negative impact on sexual function can lead to decreased adherence, and drug-class observations include that diuretics and beta-blockers (BBs), except nebivolol, are most commonly associated with erectile dysfunction in men, BBs are associated with a worsening of sexual function in women, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have the most favorable profile in men and women.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP >20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^173d94f4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable.There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014,and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines).Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations.This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries.Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom.To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations.Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension—first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Resistant hypertension—medication contributors and foundational regimen—Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

The 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/American Society of Hypertension Scientific Statement "Treatment of Hypertension in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease" is summarized in the context of a clinical case. The Statement deals with target blood pressures, and the optimal agents for the treatment of hypertension in patients with stable angina, in acute coronary syndromes, and in patients with ischemic heart failure. In all cases, the recommended blood pressure target is <140/90 mm Hg, but <130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate, especially in those with a history of a previous myocardial infarction or stroke, or at high risk for developing either. These numbers may need to be revised after the publication of the SPRINT data. Appropriate management should include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and in the case of heart failure, aldosterone antagonists. Thiazide or thiazide-like (chlorthalidone) diuretics and calcium channel blockers can be used for the management of hypertension, but the evidence for improved outcomes compared with other agents in hypertension with coronary artery disease is meager. Loop diuretics should be reserved for patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure or with a glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min.

Changes in Trends After Guidelines

After publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first‐line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first‐line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre‐JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4A). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving thiazide diuretics did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%−5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B).

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)—beta blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) show varying effects, largely from Marfan syndrome cohorts. In a small randomized trial, prophylactic propranolol (mean dose, 212±68 mg/d) slowed aortic root growth and reduced aortic complications, and in 155 children <12 years of age, beta blockers decreased aortic root growth by 0.16 mm/y; additionally, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline states beta-blocker therapy is recommended first-line antihypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension and TAD. A meta-analysis of 1510 randomized patients with Marfan syndrome–associated TAA showed slower aortic root growth with ARBs versus placebo, no difference versus beta-blocker therapy, and slower growth with beta blocker plus ARB than beta blocker alone, but the Jikei Heart Study supporting ARBs was retracted and the LOE for use of ARBs has been downgraded to C from B.

### AHA / ACC / ASH release guideline on the treatment of hypertension (...) [^c2393aa3]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • A blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in most patients with CAD and hypertension. • A target of 130/80 mm Hg is reasonable in selected patients with CAD, including those with previous MI, stroke, or CAD risk equivalents. • Recommended medications for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. • Medications with evidence that they reduce risks in patients with ACS include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and possibly aldosterone antagonists. From the AFP Editors The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Society of Hypertension have released a guideline on the management of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. It updates a previous AHA guideline to reflect newer data.

There is a strong association between hypertension and CAD. This guideline uses the best available evidence to make recommendations about blood pressure reduction and the management of CAD and its varying manifestations. If there are no contraindications to beta blockers, the initial therapy for hypertension in patients with ACS should be an oral short-acting beta. Beta-blocker therapy should be delayed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have decompensated heart failure. A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be substituted for the beta blocker in patients with ongoing ischemia and no left ventricular dysfunction, and a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can be added if hypertension and angina are not controlled with initial treatment. An ACE inhibitor or ARB should be added if the patient has an anterior MI or diabetes, hypertension persists, or there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure.

An ACE inhibitor is first-line therapy for lower-risk patients. Aldosterone antagonists are indicated in patients already taking a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor after an MI, and have left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure or diabetes. Serum potassium levels should be monitored, and the medications should be avoided in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels.

Prevention of cardiovascular events—acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^83ee619e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta‐blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re‐assessed the place of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.

Pharmacological treatment for hypertension—other outcomes and beta blocker considerations: The Work Group did not make a formal recommendation for other outcomes such as stroke or heart failure reduction alone, but notable findings were that thiazide-type diuretics were superior to other drug classes for preventing CHF outcomes, CCBs were superior for reducing all-cause mortality, and CCBs were inferior for preventing CHF outcomes; ACEIs and ARBs are not used concomitantly due to recognized safety risks. Although the evidence was not supportive of a recommendation, providers can consider beta blockers as an alternative for patients with compelling indications (e.g., underlying coronary artery disease, following myocardial infarction, or in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), and patients intolerant to the four main classes may also consider a beta blocker; the systematic review found beta blockers were equivalent to ARBs for composite cardiovascular outcomes with no significant difference versus CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics and no critical outcomes versus ACEIs, but some important outcomes showed beta blockers were inferior, particularly for stroke reduction; beta blockers are not recommended as initial antihypertensive therapy.

### High blood pressure: ACC / AHA releases updated guideline-AAFP (...) [^659422f9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Patients whose systolic and diastolic BPs are in different categories should be assigned to the higher category. PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS The use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with clinical CVD and an average BP of 130 mm Hg or greater systolic or 80 mm Hg or greater diastolic. Medication is recommended for primary prevention in adults with an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD of 10% of more and an average BP of 130 mm Hg or greater systolic or 80 mm Hg or greater diastolic. . First-line agents include thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

Initiation of BP-lowering therapy with two first-line agents of different classes is recommended for adults with stage 2 hypertension and an average BP more than 20/10 mm Hg above their target. Therapy with a single agent is reasonable in adults with stage 1 hypertension and target BP less than 130/80 mm Hg. The dosage should be titrated and additional agents added sequentially to achieve the BP target. Simultaneous use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and/or renin inhibitor is not recommended. Treatment Goals A target BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended for adults with confirmed hypertension and CVD or a 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk of 10% or more. A target of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable for adults with confirmed hypertension but no additional markers of increased CVD risk. Target BPs for adults with hypertension and comorbid conditions are shown in.

Adults with stage 2 hypertension should be evaluated by or referred to a primary care physician within one month, receive a combination of nonpharmacologic interventions and BP-lowering medications, and undergo repeat evaluation in one month. Adults with very high BPs should be evaluated quickly and provided drug therapy.

### For debate: the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines-cause for concern [^13a754d0]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Sadly, all the guideline committees (from the USA, the UK and Europe) largely comprise hospital-based specialists. In contrast, most patients with hypertension are managed exclusively in primary care settings because they are less likely to have cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Hospital-based hypertension specialists are more likely to encounter more complex cases many of whom may have suffered the vascular complications of hypertension. The re-endorsement of the beta-blockers for uncomplicated hypertension might not have happened if more primary care physicians had had greater input into the preparation of the guidelines.

To some extent, arguments about first-line drugs are of only limited use as, in most patients, double or triple therapy is necessary to bring the BP under control. But even then, the beta-blockers are only required if there is concomitant heart disease. In primary healthcare, such patients are in the minority. Hence, the return of beta-blockers as a first-line option for the management of uncomplicated hypertension by the ESH is a cause for concern and should be reconsidered.

### Beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension? [^37a1da9e]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

They conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials using a beta blocker as first-line therapy for primary hypertension. Eligibility was restricted to trials in which beta blockers were used in at least one half of all patients in the treatment group, and the outcomes measured included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, or both. Studies were identified from electronic databases of systematic reviews and published reports. The analysis separated studies comparing beta blockers with placebo from those comparing beta blockers with other drugs. The outcome measures considered were stroke, myocar-dial infarction, and death. Heart failure was not included as an outcome because it was not reported in several trials. In the seven studies comparing beta blockers with placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19 percent with beta blockers.

The greatest reduction in stroke risk occurred in the two studies that used beta blockers in combination with other drugs, usually diuretics. Combination therapy was associated with a 45 percent reduction in stroke risk and a 43 percent reduction in mortality risk. In the 13 eligible studies comparing beta blockers with other antihypertensive drugs, the relative risk of stroke was 16 percent higher with beta blockers than with alternative drugs. The groups did not differ in the risk of myocardial infarction, and there was a 3 percent increase in the relative risk of overall mortality in the beta-blocker group. Subgroup analysis showed the most significant increased risk of stroke in patients treated with atenolol. Too few events occurred in patients treated with non-atenolol beta blockers to draw valid conclusions.

The authors conclude that the reduction in stroke risk associated with beta-blocker therapy is about 19 percent, or about one half of the effect commonly quoted in the medical literature. They speculate that the effectiveness of beta blockers has been overestimated because these agents are commonly prescribed in combination with thiazide diuretics. Because all antihy-pertensive drugs lower blood pressure by comparable amounts, the authors discuss mechanisms that might explain the superior effect of non-beta blockers in stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Possible explanations include effects on lipid and glucose metabolism or a differential effect on brachial and central blood pressure. They conclude that beta-blocker therapy is suboptimal and may prove more expensive than alternative therapies if the costs of the excess adverse events are taken into consideration.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension in noncardiac surgery—beta-blocker (BB) and clonidine management: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for GDMT indications, with clinical judgment used in titrating BB during the perioperative period and focusing on continuing the medication through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and when there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Beta blockers—synopsis for CCD notes mechanisms, populations, and indications: Beta blockers exhibit their clinical effects by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, improving ischemic threshold, and impeding maladaptive LV remodeling. Patients with CCD comprise patients with or without previous MI, LV systolic dysfunction, or both, and these distinctions should be considered in determining indications for beta‑blocker therapy. The strongest data for the benefit of beta‑blockers in CCD is for patients with LV systolic dysfunction, but benefit is less clear without LV dysfunction. Several ongoing RCTs aim to elucidate the need for and duration of beta‑blocker therapy for MACE reduction among post‑MI patients with preserved LV systolic function. Other primary indications may include angina, uncontrolled hypertension, or arrhythmias, and comprehensive screening is recommended because therapy may still be indicated for antianginal, antihypertensive, or negative chronotropic effects among patients with rhythm disturbance disorders.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^ba9e3bfe]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

PERSPECTIVES

The multiple important data in favor of BBs that have been discussed in this article justify their inclusion among the major drugs to be used for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, ACEIs, CCBs, and ARBs. This also carries the advantage of increasing the number of options available to the physician to effectively lower an elevated BP by mono or combination therapy, achieving cardiovascular protection in a greater number of patients. Although they should be appropriately taken into account, the inconveniences of BBs (treatment discontinuation, lesser protection against subclinical organ damage, dysmetabolic effects) should not be used as an exclusion criterion to avoid the double standard of judgment that has never regarded the same inconveniences a problem for the use of diuretics. The same is true for the lesser protective effect of BBs against stroke that cannot ignore that different protective effects against cause-specific events characterize all major drugs and, in the case of BBs, do not prevent an effective overall cardiovascular protection.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and concomitant hypertension—defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%—should have at least a systolic blood pressure (SBP) target of <130 mm Hg, with diuretics added for volume overload; dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) may be used if blood pressure (BP) remains elevated after guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization, whereas nondihydropyridine CCB are not recommended due to potential harm.

### Cardiovascular protection using β-blockers: a critical review of the evidence [^00d5d8cd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

For more than 3 decades, beta-blockers have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and are still recommended as first-line agents by national and international guidelines. Recent meta-analyses indicate that, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, compared with other antihypertensive agents, first-line therapy with beta-blockers was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in the elderly cohort with no benefit for the end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. In this review, we critically analyze the evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and evaluate evidence for its role in other indications. The review of the currently available literature shows that in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is a paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first-line agents. Given the increased risk of stroke, their "pseudo-antihypertensive" efficacy (failure to lower central aortic pressure), lack of effect on regression of target end organ effects like left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, and numerous adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication. However, beta-blockers remain very efficacious agents for the treatment of heart failure, certain types of arrhythmia, hypertropic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)—hypertension management emphasizes diuretics, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), with limited beta-blocker (BB) use. Hypertension “is a major risk factor for developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and an important target for HF management to reduce hospitalization, CVD events, and mortality.” Diuretics are pivotal and “should be used for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload.” “RAASi are indicated for management of HFpEF to attain an SBP of <130 mm Hg, especially with an MRA or ARNI, or ARB when ARNI is not feasible.” Conversely, “BB are not recommended for hypertension management with HFpEF … and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions.” “SGLT2i are used frequently … to reduce the risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality,” and because “SGLT2i may lower BP,” dose “adjustment in other antihypertensive medications may be indicated if signs or symptoms of hypotension are present.”

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS)—initial medical management is achieved with anti-impulse therapy using a combination of intravenous beta blockers and vasodilators to reduce both heart rate and blood pressure (BP) to decrease aortic wall stress, with small studies emphasizing reduction of heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and systolic BP (SBP) to <120 mm Hg. Intravenous beta blockers have been the mainstay of acute medical treatment, with reports emphasizing the importance of continuing this therapy at the time of hospital discharge to improve clinical outcomes; caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia), and for intolerance to beta blockers, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia. Pain related to AAS can trigger a rise in heart rate and BP, so treating pain can help control the patient’s BP and heart rate; intravenous opiates are particularly efficacious, whereas intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac may not be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension as well as adverse renal effects.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management—continuation and class-specific considerations are as follows: ongoing treatment of chronic hypertension is recommended in the perioperative period, and if hypertensive patients are unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications to control BP. The decision whether to hold or continue antihypertensive medications may be specific to drug class, because certain medications (eg, beta blockers, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly, whereas others have been associated with increased risk of intraoperative hypotension when continued (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs]).

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^7146033b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications, and they have been traditionally considered "cardioprotective." Their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. On the other hand, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^569a5fcd]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

Beta-blockers are no longer considered as a preferred initial therapy for essential hypertension. The changing approach and therapeutic options are further clarified in the most recent guidelines. However, many patients still receive beta-blockers or continue therapy from historical prescriptions. Our analysis confirms that beta-blockers are inferior to other agents (most notably CCB and RAS antagonists), particularly in preventing strokes. This may be partly explained by differences in achieved BP, including central systolic BP between different drug treatments, to which cerebrovascular events may be particularly sensitive. In addition, beta-blockers are somewhat less effective than RAS antagonists and CCB in preventing target organ damage.

Importantly, beta-blockers are a heterogeneous class. Whilst vasodilating beta-blockers, such as nebivolol, have demonstrated favourable effects on central BP and cardiovascular surrogates, RCTs with these newer beta-blockers in hypertensive patients are currently lacking. It is possible that there are important differences between beta-blockers in efficacy and safety; however, there are insufficient data to be certain as atenolol was utilised in ~ 75% of trials (our sensitivity analysis could only group together ‘non-atenolol’ studies). Although there remains a place for beta-blockers in resistant hypertension or those with cardiovascular comorbidities, our data would suggest that physicians should be more aggressive in switching to alternative classes of anti-hypertensive medication.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^8b933424]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

We address the reasons why, unlike other guidelines, in the 2023 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension β-blockers (BBs) have been regarded as major drugs for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. We argue that BBs, (1) reduce blood pressure (the main factor responsible for treatment-related protection) not less than other drugs, (2) reduce pooled cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in placebo-controlled trials, in which there has also been a sizeable reduction of all major cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes, (3) have been associated with a lower global cardiovascular protection in 2 but not in several other comparison trials, in which the protective effect of BBs versus the other major drugs has been similar or even greater, with a slightly smaller or no difference of global benefit in large trial meta-analyses and a similar protective effect when comparisons extend to BBs in combination versus other drug combinations. We mention the large number of cardiac and other comorbidities for which BBs are elective drugs, and we express criticism against the exclusion of BBs because of their lower protective effect against stroke in comparison trials, because, for still uncertain reasons, differences in protection against cause-specific events (stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease) have been reported for other major drugs. These partial data cannot replace global benefits as the main deciding factor for drug choice, also because in the general hypertensive population whether and which type of event might occur is unknown.

### Β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension [^5354f39c]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events when used as initial treatment in individuals with hypertension compared with placebo, no treatment, or other drugs?

Bottom Line

Initial therapy of hypertension with β-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than β-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional β-blockers (eg, atenolol and propranolol), because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating β-blockers (eg, carvedilol and nebivolol).

Chronic coronary disease—antihypertensive pharmacotherapy selection emphasizes comparative outcomes and first-line agents. In the Verapamil SR(Trandolapril Study) trial, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta‑blocker/thiazide diuretic therapy had similar cardiovascular morbidity and death outcomes. In patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD), ACE inhibitor therapy produced a 20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular death (CVD death), myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac arrest compared with placebo. Because of these benefits, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) “are recommended as a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension in such individuals,” and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) beta blockers include carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Outcomes with atenolol appear inferior to other antihypertensive drugs, and when beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARB therapies do not sufficiently control blood pressure, additional GDMT therapies can be added, including thiazide diuretics, CCB, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Β-blockers in hypertension-the emperor has no clothes: an open letter to present and prospective drafters of new guidelines for the treatment of hypertension [^a9d69f04]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, national and international guidelines have proposed beta-blockers to be used on an equal footing with diuretics for initial therapy of hypertension. This preferred status was supposedly based on evidence documenting a reduction in morbidity and mortality with beta-blocker therapy in hypertension. We systematically analyzed all available outcome studies and found no evidence that beta-blocker based therapy, despite lowering blood pressure, reduced the risk of heart attacks or strokes. Despite the inefficacy of beta-blockers, the incidence of adverse effects is substantial. In the MRC study, for every heart attack or stroke prevented, three patients withdrew from atenolol because of impotence, and another seven withdrew because of fatigue. Thus the risk/benefit ratio of beta-blockers is characterized by lack of efficacy and multiple adverse effects. Given that many thorough, prospective, randomized trials attest to efficacy and safety of diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor inhibitors, the time has come to admit that beta-blockers should no longer be considered appropriate for first-line therapy in uncomplicated hypertension.

### Should beta blockers remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension? A meta-analysis [^fc5164bd]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta blockers have been used widely in the treatment of hypertension and are recommended as first-line drugs in hypertension guidelines. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that atenolol is not very effective in hypertension. We aim to substantially enlarge the data on atenolol and analyse the effect of different beta blockers.

Methods

The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for beta blocker treatment in patients with primary hypertension. Data were then entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager package and were summarised in meta-analyses. 13 randomised controlled trials (n=105 951) were included in a meta-analysis comparing treatment with beta blockers with other antihypertensive drugs. Seven studies (n=27 433) were included in a comparison of beta blockers and placebo or no treatment.

Findings

The relative risk of stroke was 16% higher for beta blockers (95% CI 4-30%) than for other drugs. There was no difference for myocardial infarction. When the effect of beta blockers was compared with that of placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19% for all beta blockers (7-29%), about half that expected from previous hypertension trials. There was no difference for myocardial infarction or mortality.

Interpretation

In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of beta blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that beta blockers should not remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomised controlled trials of hypertension.

Selection of antihypertensive agents in resistant hypertension

According to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2017, International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020 and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 Guidelines, the preferred antihypertensive drug treatment of resistant hypertension should at least include the following antihypertensive classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist (=calcium channel blocker), and thiazide diuretics.The steps recommended to apply if triple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic) fails to achieve optimal BP are the following (Figure 1):

Figure 1. 
Assessment of apparent and true resistant hypertension. Abbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HT, hypertension; T/TL, thiazide/thiazide-like.

- To optimize and tailor the current treatment regimen based on individual risk factors including health behavior changes.
- Use of thiazide-like rather than thiazide diuretics, and initiation of loop diuretics for estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or clinical volume overload.
- Add a low dose of spironolactone as the 4th line agent in patients whose serum potassium is <4.5 mmol/l and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate is >45 ml/min/1.73m 2 to achieve BP targets.
- If spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, amiloride, beta-blocker, clonidine, doxazosin, and eplerenone are alternatives, or any available antihypertensive class not already in use.

### One size does not fit all: the role of vasodilating β-blockers in controlling hypertension as a means of reducing cardiovascular and stroke risk [^d6a2383e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers have played a key role in the management of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease for decades, and continue to be recommended as a mainstay of therapy in national guidelines statements. Recent data have shown less optimal reductions in total mortality, CVD mortality, and CVD events with beta-blockers compared with renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers. The beta-blocker class, however, spans a wide range of agents, and the growing concern about the risk-benefit profile of beta-blockers should not be generalized to later-generation vasodilating beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol. A growing database from hypertension studies confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of vasodilating beta-blockers, and outcome studies indicate that these agents can play an important role in global CVD reduction in patients with hypertensive or ischemic heart failure.
