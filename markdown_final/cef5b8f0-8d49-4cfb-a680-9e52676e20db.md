## Question

Can a vitamin D deficiency lead to hypocalcemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin D deficiency can lead to hypocalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about vitamin D physiology and its role in calcium homeostasis. Then, I should confirm the laboratory definitions of vitamin D deficiency and when hypocalcemia becomes likely. Next, I will examine the compensatory parathyroid response and why it fails in severe deficiency. After that, I should review clinical evidence from pediatric, neonatal, and surgical cohorts. Finally, I will consider special risk populations, clinical manifestations, and evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies, cross-checking guideline recommendations along the way [^114tvLJq] [^114xwr92].

> Let me first confirm the physiologic basis: active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcitriol) increases intestinal calcium absorption by upregulating calcium transport proteins; without adequate 25-hydroxyvitamin D substrate, calcitriol generation and gut calcium uptake fall, predisposing to negative calcium balance and potential hypocalcemia, especially when demands are high or intake is low [^115UefzF] [^1165kh6X]. Hold on, I should verify the tissue target that matters most; elegant animal data indicate the intestine is the primary site mediating vitamin D's effects on skeletal calcium balance, so impaired intestinal transport is central to this mechanism [^115UefzF].

> I should confirm the definitional thresholds next. The Endocrine Society 2011 guideline defines vitamin D deficiency as 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20–29 ng/mL, and acknowledges some debate about "optimal" targets, with many bodies aiming for 20–30 ng/mL; this frames the levels at which calcium abnormalities may emerge, typically more often when values are very low [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] [^114xwr92]. Wait, let me verify how low levels translate to biochemical consequences; consensus statements note that overt hypocalcemia tends to appear when 25-hydroxyvitamin D drops below about 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL), though milder deficiency often triggers compensatory changes without frank hypocalcemia [^1165kh6X].

> Now, I will examine the compensatory physiology, because I need to ensure I am not jumping to conclusions. In mild to moderate deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism increases renal calcium reabsorption, bone resorption, and renal 1α-hydroxylase activity to maintain serum calcium near normal; however, when 25-hydroxyvitamin D is severely depressed, PTH-driven calcitriol synthesis is substrate limited and the system can no longer hold calcium in the normal range, leading to hypocalcemia despite high PTH [^1165kh6X] [^113Mnisu] [^1127XE1Y]. Let me double-check that this is consistent with clinical descriptions; yes, guidelines and reviews consistently describe secondary hyperparathyroidism as a hallmark of deficiency that can mask hypocalcemia until deficiency is severe or prolonged [^114tvLJq] [^1165kh6X].

> Next, I should review real-world clinical data to validate the mechanism. A pediatric inpatient series defined severe deficiency as 25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 10 ng/mL and included children with corrected calcium below 8 mg/dL; the report lists a mean calcium "6.0 mmol/L", but wait, that unit cannot be right for human serum calcium and appears to be a unit misprint, so I should correct my interpretation to mg/dL, which aligns with symptomatic hypocalcemia and the reported ionized calcium means; neurologic signs and ECG abnormalities were common in that cohort, supporting the link between severe deficiency and clinically significant hypocalcemia [^114RV8B2]. Let me corroborate in neonates; a meta-analysis found approximately 2.9-fold higher odds of neonatal hypocalcemia with neonatal vitamin D deficiency and nearly 7.8-fold higher odds with maternal deficiency, strengthening the causal inference in early life where dependency on maternal and dietary supply is high [^114Zqtw3].

> Hold on, I should verify whether surgical settings unmask this physiology. Multiple thyroidectomy cohorts show that preoperative vitamin D deficiency, particularly when severe, independently predicts higher rates of postoperative hypocalcemia, consistent with a system that cannot maintain calcium when the parathyroids are stunned or transiently impaired; severe preoperative deficiency conferred roughly sevenfold higher odds of postoperative hypocalcemia in one series, and other studies report similar associations, with professional society guidance recommending perioperative vitamin D and calcium optimization to mitigate risk [^116my3yR] [^1131EVpL] [^111tGt9M] [^114ekRpp] [^111H4sYr].

> Let me consider who is most vulnerable, because risk stratification matters clinically. Infants and children have high skeletal demands and, when unsupplemented or with low calcium intake, can present with rickets and symptomatic hypocalcemia; maternal deficiency compounds neonatal risk via low fetal stores and milk content, a pattern repeatedly observed in resurgence settings and reflected in contemporary series [^115jERpW] [^112MGewS]. I should also review CKD, where low 25-hydroxyvitamin D and impaired 1α-hydroxylation, along with elevated FGF-23, predispose to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism; hypocalcemia clusters with vitamin D deficiency in CKD cohorts and is associated with worse outcomes, so deficiency here further destabilizes calcium balance [^113uyojE] [^113goT4d].

> I will now examine clinical manifestations to ensure alignment with the pathophysiology. Hypocalcemia from vitamin D deficiency presents with neuromuscular excitability (paresthesias, tetany, seizures), and in severe cases cardiovascular involvement such as prolonged QT and reversible heart failure; these features are repeatedly documented in hypocalcemia overviews and critical care contexts where deficiency is prevalent and correction of vitamin D may be necessary to normalize calcium [^1127XE1Y] [^113QTgD8]. But wait, I should not overlook the skeletal manifestations; persistent deficiency produces osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children, reflecting impaired mineralization secondary to decreased calcium and phosphate availability [^1165kh6X] [^1173WYpp].

> Next, I should outline prevention and management, while double-checking guideline consistency. For deficiency states, repletion with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol restores 25-hydroxyvitamin D and thereby intestinal calcium absorption; Endocrine Society guidance suggests at least 600 IU/day in most adults, with many requiring 1,500–2,000 IU/day to keep 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL, and at least 400 IU/day in infants and 600 IU/day in children, adjusting upward when needed for sufficiency [^114tvLJq] [^114Hfpqn] [^111mfiHt]. Let me verify dosing strategies for faster correction; modeling and clinical data support safe loading to reach targets, and routine monitoring of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium is reasonable in high-risk states or when high doses are used, rather than measuring 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D which is generally not indicated for deficiency assessment [^112X1b5H] [^111vVZHD] [^113YzgpM]. Hold on, I should ensure safety signals are covered; active vitamin D analogs like calcitriol are reserved for specific conditions and carry a hypercalcemia risk, so their use should be judicious and not confused with nutritional repletion, whereas correcting concomitant hypomagnesemia is often necessary when hypocalcemia is refractory due to impaired PTH secretion and action [^11475KCH] [^112Nbuvs].

> Stepping back, I should confirm that the overall conclusion reflects both physiology and clinical evidence. Vitamin D deficiency decreases intestinal calcium absorption, triggers secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in severe or prolonged cases overcomes compensatory mechanisms to produce true hypocalcemia; this is supported by mechanistic reviews, pediatric and neonatal data, and perioperative literature, and it is addressed by guideline-endorsed strategies to replete vitamin D and ensure adequate calcium intake while monitoring for safety [^115UefzF] [^1165kh6X] [^114RV8B2] [^114Zqtw3] [^116my3yR] [^114tvLJq].

---

In brief, vitamin D deficiency can cause hypocalcemia by **reducing intestinal calcium absorption** [^114tvLJq] and triggering **secondary hyperparathyroidism** [^113goT4d], which increases bone resorption [^115UefzF] and renal calcium loss. Hypocalcemia typically occurs when 25(OH)D **falls below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL)**, with risk rising as levels decline [^1165kh6X] [^116xm7rw]. Clinical features include neuromuscular irritability, tetany, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias [^1127XE1Y], and **correction of vitamin D deficiency is essential to restore calcium homeostasis** [^114tvLJq] [^114RV8B2].

---

## Physiological role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis

Vitamin D **maintains calcium homeostasis** through three mechanisms:

- **Intestinal absorption**: Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption, maintaining serum calcium levels [^115UefzF].

- **Bone resorption**: Vitamin D stimulates osteoclasts to release calcium from bone when needed [^113goT4d].

- **Renal reabsorption**: Vitamin D promotes renal calcium reabsorption, reducing urinary calcium loss [^114tvLJq].

---

## Mechanism of hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency

Vitamin D deficiency **reduces intestinal calcium absorption** [^115UefzF], lowering serum calcium and triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113goT4d]. Elevated PTH increases bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption; with prolonged deficiency, bone calcium stores become depleted, leading to **persistent hypocalcemia** [^114tvLJq] [^1127XE1Y].

---

## Clinical evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to hypocalcemia

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm that **vitamin D deficiency causes hypocalcemia** [^1127XE1Y]. The Endocrine Society recognizes vitamin D deficiency as a cause of hypocalcemia [^114tvLJq]. Severe deficiency can cause life-threatening pediatric hypocalcemia with seizures and cardiac arrhythmias [^114RV8B2], and deficiency is a significant cause of neonatal hypocalcemia [^114Zqtw3] [^112MGewS].

---

## Threshold levels of vitamin D associated with hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia risk increases as 25(OH)D declines, with a **critical threshold around 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL)** [^1165kh6X]:

| **Vitamin d status** | **25(OH)d level** | **Hypocalcemia risk** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe deficiency | < 25 nmol/L (< 10 ng/mL) | High [^1165kh6X] |
| Moderate deficiency | 25–50 nmol/L (10–20 ng/mL) | Moderate [^114xwr92] |
| Sufficiency | > 50 nmol/L (> 20 ng/mL) | Low [^114tvLJq] |

---

## Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia due to vitamin D deficiency

Hypocalcemia from vitamin D deficiency presents with:

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Tetany, muscle cramps, paresthesia, seizures [^1127XE1Y].

- **Cardiac symptoms**: Arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval [^114RV8B2] [^113QTgD8].

- **Skeletal symptoms**: Bone pain, osteomalacia, rickets [^1173WYpp] [^114tvLJq].

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain groups are at **higher risk** of hypocalcemia from vitamin D deficiency:

- **Infants and children**: Rapid growth increases calcium needs [^114RV8B2] [^115jERpW].

- **Elderly individuals**: Reduced skin synthesis and dietary intake [^1144Ymwq].

- **Individuals with limited sun exposure**: Dark skin, cultural clothing, indoor lifestyle [^114xwr92].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Impaired vitamin D activation [^113goT4d].

---

## Correction of vitamin D deficiency and calcium homeostasis

Correcting vitamin D deficiency **restores calcium homeostasis** by increasing intestinal absorption, reducing secondary hyperparathyroidism, and normalizing serum calcium [^114tvLJq]. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium is **effective in preventing and treating hypocalcemia** [^112taDcv] [^111pZT4t].

---

## Clinical guidelines for management

Clinical guidelines **recommend correcting vitamin D deficiency** to restore calcium homeostasis [^114tvLJq] and using calcium supplementation with vitamin D to prevent hypocalcemia [^112taDcv] [^111pZT4t]. They also advise **regular monitoring** of serum calcium and vitamin D levels during treatment [^112X1b5H].

---

Vitamin D deficiency is a well-established cause of **hypocalcemia**, primarily by reducing intestinal calcium absorption and inducing secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1127XE1Y] [^1165kh6X]. Hypocalcemia risk rises as 25(OH)D falls below 25 nmol/L, and correcting deficiency with vitamin D and calcium supplementation effectively restores calcium homeostasis [^1165kh6X] [^112taDcv].

Maintaining normal calcium and phosphate homeostasis is essential for optimal cellular, metabolic, and organ function. Parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis via multiple interlinked feedback loops, receptors, ion channels, and transporters. Following an initial overview of the stimuli and effects of the different hormonal regulators, this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology reviews the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate disorders through the lens of a series of illustrative cases.

The cases span clinical conundrums commonly encountered by nephrologists in their daily clinical practice and other less common disorders. Some of the cases present in the outpatient clinic setting and others in the inpatient hospital setting. Patients with normal kidney function, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and acute kidney injury are all represented. Some of the disorders are iatrogenic, and some are due to native disease. All demonstrate key aspects of pathophysiology that are essential knowledge for nephrology clinicians of all career stages.

### Characteristics of vitamin D deficiency hypocalcemia inpatient admissions at a single tertiary center [^114RV8B2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Severe 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency can result in life-threatening presentations due to hypocalcemia, leading to seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of hypocalcemia and rickets in children; however, there are no recent studies on the burden of inpatient admissions in the United States. Our study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors of inpatient admissions due to severe hypocalcemia and 25(OH)D deficiency at a freestanding academic children's hospital.

- **Methods**: A descriptive retrospective chart review was completed on all inpatient admissions from 2016 to 2021 for children aged 0–18 years with corrected calcium < 8 mg/dL and 25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL during admission.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (74% Black/African American). Neurological signs were described in 49%, bone abnormalities in 17%, and EKG abnormalities in 42% of the patients. The mean calcium serum level was 6.0 mmol/L (range 5.0–7.9 mmol/L), and the mean iCa was 0.77 mmol/L (range 0.54–0.99 mmol/L). The mean level of 25(OH)D was 5.5 ng/mL (range 2.1–9.7 ng/mL). The median length of stay was 4.5 days (range 1–59 days).

- **Conclusions**: In this retrospective observational study, risk factors identified include Black/African American race, age less than two years, lack of supplementation of vitamin D, and dietary restrictions. Inpatient admissions are preventable through the implementation of education at the community and healthcare levels.

The disease of vitamin D deficiency can be associated with a variety of conditions and factors. These include malabsorption, increased serum PTH, undergoing bariatric surgery, and corticosteroid use. Symptoms may manifest as bone pain, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rickets, osteopenia, myalgia, and a history of fractures. Other physical signs include bowed legs, muscle weakness, decreased serum calcium, hip pain, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, and osteoporosis. Furthermore, there may be decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, chronic kidney disease (CKD) involvement, the use of anticonvulsants, limited sun exposure, and dark skin color.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1165kh6X]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D, thus increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites.

More severe prolonged vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake.

### Effects of cholecalciferol vs calcifediol on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^112diNkt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects nonwhite individuals. Controversy persists over how to best restore low 25D levels and how to best define vitamin D status, whether by total (protein-bound plus free) versus free 25D.

The objective was to assess the effects of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, or D3) versus 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol, or 25D3) on total and free 25D in a multiethnic cohort of adults, and to determine if the change in parathyroid hormone (PTH) is more strongly associated with total versus free 25D.

The study was a sixteen-week randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic medical center. Participants included thirty-five adults, aged 18 years or older, with 25D levels below 20 ng/mL. The intervention involved administering 60 micrograms (2400 IU) per day of D3 or 20 micrograms per day of 25D3.

- **Main outcome measures**: Total and free 25D, and PTH.

- **Results**: Baseline total (16.2 ± 3.7 vs. 17.0 ± 2.5 ng/mL; P = 0.4) and free (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 4.7 ± 1.0 pg/mL; P = 0.2) 25D were similar between the D3 and 25D3 groups, respectively. However, 25D3 resulted in a greater increase in total (+25.5 vs. +13.8 ng/mL; P = 0.001) and free (+6.6 vs. +3.5 pg/mL; P = 0.03) 25D compared to D3. By four weeks, 87.5% of 25D3 participants had total 25D levels ≥ 30 ng/mL compared to 23.1% of D3 participants (P = 0.001). Change in PTH was associated with both total (P = 0.01) and free 25D (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: 25D3 increased total and free 25D levels more rapidly than D3, regardless of race/ethnicity. Free and total 25D were similarly associated with changes in PTH.

### Vitamin D receptors and parathyroid glands [^113Mnisu]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe the function and metabolism of the vitamin D hormone and the role of the vitamin D receptor and the calcium-sensing receptor in the secretion of parathyroid hormone.

- **Methods**: A literature review was performed on the function and metabolism of vitamin D, the role of the vitamin D receptor and calcium-sensing receptor in the secretion of parathyroid hormone, and contemporary research on the interaction of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in patients with vitamin D deficiency, primary hyperparathyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

- **Results**: In recent years, significant interest has emerged regarding the interaction of vitamin D with the parathyroid glands, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and bone concerning calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and parathyroid hormone metabolism. Additionally, the vitamin D axis is involved in the development of both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The precise mechanism by which vitamin D interacts with the parathyroid gland to produce observed effects remains not fully understood.

- **Conclusion**: Future studies examining the relationship among the vitamin D receptor, calcium-sensing receptor, and parathyroid glands are necessary to enhance our understanding of vitamin D deficiency and both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

At the time of writing, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

- **Figure 2**: Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows the metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor.

### Low serum calcium is associated with poor renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease stages 3–4 patients [^113uyojE]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Several potential mechanisms could explain our study observations. First, hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D deficiency could be associated with increased circulating FGF-23 levels and renal functional deterioration. Studies have shown an inverse association between renal function and FGF-23 levels in CKD. Isakova et al. evaluated a large prospective cohort of patients with CKD stages 2–4 and identified that elevated FGF-23 is an independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nakano et al. further reported that increased FGF-23 was significantly associated with a higher risk of ESRD, irrespective of CKD stage, and that serum calcium was associated with renal events after adjusting for FGF-23.

In an advanced CKD population, suboptimal levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 are frequently observed. Experimental and epidemiologic data have emphasized the contribution of vitamin D deficiency toward impaired kidney function. Low plasma 1,25(OH)2D increases the likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis in patients with advanced CKD. De Boer et al. observed a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25(OH)D) and rapid reduction in GFR in older adults with normal baseline kidney function. Therefore, hypocalcemia might indicate the severity of vitamin D deficiency and emphasize its pathophysiological role in renal functional decline.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^115jERpW]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Severe vitamin D deficiency (30 nmol/L) in infants or children can cause rickets. The vitamin D endocrine system plays a limited role in prenatal life but becomes active shortly after birth. Because fetal serum 25OHD reflects that of the mother, maternal vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of nutritional rickets and hypocalcemia in the first months of life. The vitamin D content of mother's milk or non-fortified cow milk is low, and exposure of infants or small children to direct sunlight may be dangerous.

The incidence of rickets in Western populations is low due to the widespread vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/d in most Western countries for many decades. When supplementation is not conducted, for example, due to a macrobiotic diet or among children of non-Western immigrants, the incidence of rickets increases sharply. Low adherence rates to vitamin D supplementation in the very young in the United Kingdom have led to a resurgence of rickets and even casualties due to cardiomyopathy. Part of this resurgence is attributed to an increase in the nonwhite population, rising from 5.9% in 1991 to 14% in 2011. Systematic daily supply of 400 IU of vitamin D can prevent nutritional rickets, as was clearly demonstrated in Turkey where the incidence of rickets was reduced from 6% to 0.1%.

However, rickets can still develop independent of vitamin D status with an intake of calcium of less than 250/300 mg daily (up to 12 months and after 12 months of age, respectively). Nutritional rickets is a risk factor for fractures in children and adolescents, and it can also have major consequences.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112KAZmH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, calcitriol is not suitable for supplementation or nutritional fortification, and none of the many excellent reviews, guidelines, and policy papers consider the use of calcitriol in the nutritional context (supplementation and fortification). However, guidelines suggest that vitamin D supplementation is advised in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney failure, and low vitamin D status in addition to receiving therapeutic doses of calcitriol. Such a recommendation is motivated by the activity of extrarenal 1-α-hydroxylase, which is compromised by reduced renal function (i.e. not regulated by PTH) and is not regulated by feedback mechanisms.

- **Vitamin D safety and monitoring**: Vitamin D supplementation is generally a safe treatment with minimal adverse events and no need for strict monitoring. However, side effects of vitamin D treatment exist and can result in vitamin D toxicity (VDT).

- **Vitamin D toxicity**: VDT is a clinical condition characterized by excess vitamin D (hypervitaminosis D), resulting in severe hypercalcemia that may persist for a prolonged period of time, leading to serious health consequences. Signs and symptoms of VDT are related primarily to hypercalcemia, with complications encompassing adverse events in the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. VDT prevalence is unknown, but it is rare due to the wide therapeutic index of vitamin D. Evidence from systematic studies of VDT in humans is missing for ethical reasons, and data mostly stem from studies of VDT in animals and anecdotal reports.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Phosphate is not only an essential component of the mineralized skeleton but also plays a critical role in various physiological and cellular functions. Several mineral-regulating hormones, including 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23, primarily modulate serum phosphate levels at the bone, kidney, and intestine levels. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms, and since these levels are not routinely measured in laboratory analyses, disorders of hypophosphatemia are often overlooked during patient evaluations.

In the past few decades, there has been significant progress in identifying the genetic causes of and novel therapies for hypophosphatemic disorders. This review discusses the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, clinical presentation, work-up, disorders, and treatment of hypophosphatemia.

### Preoperative vitamin D level as predictor of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia in patients sustaining transient parathyroid injury [^111tGt9M]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies have sought to identify predictors of postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy; however, there have been conflicting results regarding the impact of preoperative vitamin D deficiency.

- **Methods**: The medical records of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy were retrospectively reviewed. The number of parathyroid glands identified or reimplanted at the time of surgery was used as a marker of transient parathyroid gland damage.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. Vitamin D deficiency was a significant predictor of hypocalcemia in patients in whom ≥ 3 parathyroid glands were identified, but not in patients in whom 0–2 parathyroid glands were identified intraoperatively (odds ratio [OR] 5.8; p = 0.036).

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin D deficiency is a significant predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia in patients in whom ≥ 3 parathyroid glands are identified intraoperatively, but not in patients who sustain minimal transient damage to the parathyroid glands.

In specific circumstances concerning vitamin D deficiency, particularly for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend considering the initiation of vitamin D as needed. This is particularly essential in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. It is also advised to monitor serum calcium levels closely.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^113sKttb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Treatment and monitoring of hypoparathyroidism during pregnancy: Active vitamin D treatment and calcium supplements are the main treatment modalities during pregnancy. The goal is to aim for an albumin-adjusted and/or ionized calcium level in the lower end of the normal range. Native vitamin D supplements are recommended to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations in the normal range. Magnesium supplements should also be used in case of a deficiency. In the event of severe (life-threatening) acute hypocalcemia with tetany and/or cardiac arrhythmias, we suggest as an emergency treatment the intravenous infusion of 1 to 2 g of calcium gluconate over 10 minutes.

It is critical to avoid hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia in the mother during pregnancy. Maternal hypercalcemia leads to hypercalcemia of the fetus, which may suppress PTH levels and thus cause hypoparathyroidism, increasing the risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia in the newborn after birth. Conversely, maternal hypocalcemia may not lead to fetal hypocalcemia until maternal serum calcium is severely reduced, as calcium is transferred by the placenta to the fetus at the expense of the maternal skeleton. Severe and longstanding maternal hypocalcemia can, however, cause fetal hypocalcemia during pregnancy. This may lead to fetal hyperparathyroidism, demineralization of the fetal skeleton, and an increased risk of intrauterine fractures, low birth weight, and fetal death.

While earlier case reports and case series suggested a relatively high risk of pregnancy complications for women with hypoparathyroidism, recent larger national registry studies document this risk.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111mfiHt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The ES 2011 guidelines emphasize specific circumstances regarding vitamin D deficiency, particularly focusing on pediatric patients and their daily requirements. It is recommended to ensure a vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day for infants aged 0–1 year, and at least 600 IU/day for children aged ≥ 1 year, to optimize bone health. There is insufficient evidence to determine if 400 IU/day and 600 IU/day for children aged 0–1 year and 1–18 years, respectively, are sufficient to provide all potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. For raising serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently above 30 ng/mL, it is recognized that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be necessary.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^1173WYpp]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The etiology of endemic rickets was discovered a century ago. Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient elderly subjects.

VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects. These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties. From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D supplementation can effectively reduce the incidence of these diseases.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112X1b5H]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementation, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of the cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al. calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight.

Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing is associated with more variability), and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens, including patients receiving 10,000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded.

With regard to recent megatrial results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4,000 to 10,000 IU per day in the Calgary study.

### Relationship between vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone in Cape Town [^116xm7rw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with abnormal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Methods**: Vitamin D requests at a tertiary hospital in South Africa over 2 years were retrospectively analyzed along with calcium and PTH levels.

- **Results**: Only when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level dropped below 25 nmol/l was there a significant rise in PTH. A subnormal 25(OH)D level was also not always related to hypocalcemia, as more than half of patients with their 25(OH)D level below 25 nmol/l had calcium levels in the reference range. However, all patients with calcium levels below 1.8 mmol/l were shown to have vitamin D insufficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Hypovitaminosis D may coexist with a blunted PTH response. Therefore, assumptions about vitamin D status should not be made based on PTH and calcium values. 25(OH)D measurements should be requested when vitamin D deficiency is clinically suspected, irrespective of biochemical results.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^1179Eu9X]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in understanding the role of vitamin D and its metabolites on calcium and bone homeostasis over the past decades, many important questions remain unanswered. There is still at least one missing component in our understanding of the vitamin D system's role and mechanism of action in transepithelial calcium transport in the intestine. The precise function of the vitamin D endocrine system in other calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing systems, such as the kidney, placenta, breast, and parathyroid glands, remains unclear. Additionally, the role of 1,25(OH)₂D production in calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing tissues, along with its autocrine/paracrine effects, warrants further exploration.

A comprehensive understanding of the vitamin D system's contribution to overall phosphate homeostasis is lacking. Furthermore, it is essential to identify risk factors for developing nutritional rickets beyond vitamin D deficiency, such as dietary calcium intake, iron deficiency, and genetic factors. A clearer understanding of how vitamin D status affects skeletal development during fetal life, childhood, and adolescence is needed. While most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have used daily doses of vitamin D between 400 and 1200 IU, the effects of higher doses remain largely unknown. The impact of vitamin D metabolites or analogs on bone structure, turnover, and fracture incidence is also not sufficiently understood. Notably, most trials did not select participants with low serum 25OHD levels, indicating a need for future trials to focus on this demographic. Additionally, individual participant data meta-analyses should be conducted to further elucidate these questions.

### Vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism [^117NCNWB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Temporally associated with the improvement in vitamin D nutrition in many Western countries in the mid-20th century, there was a change in many characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis fibrosa cystica became a rare manifestation of what is now frequently an asymptomatic disease. At the same time, in patients with the disease, levels of PTH and parathyroid adenoma weights have fallen dramatically. An association between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of primary hyperparathyroidism has been proposed in view of these observations and others. Data support an association on two distinct levels.

- **Clinical severity**: Regardless of the clinical severity of primary hyperparathyroidism, the disease seems to be more severe in those with concomitant vitamin D deficiency.

- **Prevalence**: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency seem to be more prevalent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism than in geographically matched populations.

The association between vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism has clear implications. Co-existing vitamin D deficiency may cause the serum calcium level to fall into the normal range, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. With regard to management, preliminary data on vitamin D repletion in patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism suggest that, in some cases, correction of vitamin D deficiency may be accomplished without worsening the underlying hypercalcemia. Vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing parathyroidectomy are also at increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and "hungry bone syndrome", which underscores the importance of addressing vitamin D levels prior to surgery.

### Does pre-operative vitamin D deficiency predict postoperative hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy [^115NvcC7]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative hypocalcemia is frequent after total thyroidectomy. The role of pre-operative vitamin D levels in the pathogenesis of this condition has not been studied under the most recent guidelines for evaluation of the role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis. It is hypothesized that patients who are vitamin D deficient (VDD) pre-operatively are more likely to suffer from postoperative hypocalcemia, thereby requiring prolonged hospitalization.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy at the University of New Mexico Hospital between 2005 and 2014 was performed. Patients who underwent intentional parathyroidectomy were excluded. The study included 30 patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels obtained within 12 months before surgery.

- **Results**: Twelve patients who were VDD (25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 20 ng/mL) were compared to 18 patients who did not have VDD (non-VDD; 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 20 ng/mL). The mean nadir postoperative ionized calcium concentration was lower in the VDD group (0.99 ± 0.10 vs. 1.06 ± 0.06 mmol/L, P = 0.04) [reference range = 1.15–1.27 mmol/L], as was the postoperative concentration of phosphorus (3.48 ± 0.60 vs. 4.17 ± 0.84 mg/dL, P = 0.03). VDD patients had a longer length of stay (4.3 ± 4.4 vs. 1.7 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Three patients in the VDD group required intravenous calcium for treatment of symptomatic hypocalcemia, but none of the non-VDD patients required this intervention (P = 0.054).

- **Conclusion**: Pre-operative vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia.

### Vitamin D in primary hyperparathyroidism: Effects on clinical, biochemical, and densitometric presentation [^114AWxhq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]) deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL) are common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but data regarding their skeletal effects in PHPT are limited. The objective was to evaluate the association between 25OHD levels and PHPT severity.

This is a cross-sectional analysis of 100 PHPT patients with and without 25OHD insufficiency and deficiency from a university hospital setting. We measured calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry.

Lower 25OHD was associated with some indicators of PHPT severity (PTH: r = -0.42; P < .0001; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D: r = -0.27; p = 0.008; serum PO4: r = 0.31; p = 0.002) but not all (serum/urine calcium). Lower 25OHD was also associated with younger age, higher body mass index, male gender, better renal function, and lower vitamin D intake.

Comparison of those with deficient (< 20 ng/mL; 19%) vs. insufficient (20–29 ng/mL; 35%) vs. replete (≥ 30 ng/mL; 46%) 25OHD demonstrated more severe PHPT as reflected by higher PTH (mean ± SEM, 126 ± 10 vs. 81 ± 7 vs. 72 ± 7 pg/mL; P < .0001) but no difference in nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures, serum or urinary calcium, bone turnover markers, or BMD after adjustment for age and weight. In women, T-scores at the 1/3 radius were lower in those with 25OHD of 20–29 ng/mL, compared to those who were vitamin D replete (P = 0.048).

In multiple regression modeling, 25OHD (but not PTH) was an independent predictor of certain outcomes.

### Should vitamin D deficiency be corrected before parathyroidectomy [^1161Nehi]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with hyperparathyroidism, but the importance of replacement before surgery is controversial. We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the extent of resection and the risk of postoperative hypocalcemia for patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism.

- **Methods**: We identified patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery between 2000 and 2015 using a prospectively maintained database. Patients with normal (≥ 30 ng/mL) vitamin D were compared to those with levels less than 30 ng/mL.

- **Results**: There were 1015 (54%) patients with normal vitamin D and 872 (46%) patients with vitamin D deficiency undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone levels (median 90 versus 77 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and calcium levels (median 10.5 versus 10.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001) compared with normal vitamin D. To achieve similar cure rates, patients with vitamin D deficiency were less likely to require the removal of more than one gland (20% versus 30%, P < 0.001) than patients with normal vitamin D. Patients with vitamin D deficiency had similar rates of persistent (1.5% versus 2.0%, P = 0.43) and recurrent (1.7% versus 2.6%, P = 0.21) hyperparathyroidism. Postoperatively, both groups had equivalent rates of transient (2.3% versus 2.3%, P = 0.97) and permanent (0.2% versus 0.4%, P = 0.52) hypocalcemia.

- **Conclusions**: Restoring vitamin D in deficient patients should not delay the appropriate surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically concerning vitamin D level monitoring, the 2011 ES guidelines recommend considering serial monitoring of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels during vitamin D treatment. This is to prevent hypercalcemia in patients with extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^115UefzF]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

In conditions with defective systemic vitamin D signaling, the effects of vitamin D on bone are largely indirect and caused by a negative calcium balance resulting from reduced vitamin D action in the intestinal mucosa. This conclusion is based on several observations. First, the osteomalacia of mice with systemic inactivation of Vdr signaling can be rescued by a diet containing high calcium and lactose, similar to the restoration of the growth plate phenotype. More precisely, the rescue in Vdr-null mice was complete, but not in Cyp27b1 mice, and an explanation for this different response may be found in ligand-independent effects of the Vdr or differences in genetic or housing protocols. Second, mice with global Vdr inactivation and selective reintroduction of the Vdr in either the whole intestine or only the distal part of the intestine do not develop a skeletal phenotype. Finally, selective deletion of the Vdr in the intestine generates severe osteomalacia and decreased bone mass.

These data clearly indicate that the intestine is the primary target tissue for vitamin D action in calcium homeostasis and show that intestinal vitamin D signaling is necessary for adequate active transcellular and possible paracellular calcium transport.

During a negative calcium balance, but with a normal active vitamin D system in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, vitamin D signaling in bone cells has a role in maintaining serum calcium homeostasis by increasing bone resorption and impairing bone mineralization. These findings demonstrate that under these conditions, vitamin D plays a crucial role.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D for adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 IU/day is adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

What is NATPARA? Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). Natpara is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations or in those who get sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Natpara should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

### Calcitriol [^112Nbuvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Administration of calcitriol in excess of daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. As calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are identical to those of vitamin D overdose. High intake of calcium and phosphate in conjunction with calcitriol can lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not exceed 70 mg^2/dL^2. Elevated calcium levels in the dialysate bath may further contribute to hypercalcemia.

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**: The general treatment of hypercalcemia — defined as a serum calcium level greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal — includes the immediate cessation of calcitriol therapy, implementation of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia is achieved, commonly resolving within 2 to 7 days. Once serum calcium levels return to normal, calcitriol therapy may be resumed at a dose reduced by 0.25 mcg/day from previous levels. It is crucial to check serum calcium levels at least twice weekly after any dosage changes and during subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or significantly elevated serum calcium levels can be corrected through dialysis using a calcium-free dialysate.

### The many etiologies of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures [^115pUhJy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Seizures during the neonatal period have a broad differential diagnosis. Unlike in developing countries where hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia constitute a major cause of infantile seizures, the number of neonatal seizures attributed to hypocalcemia in developed countries has decreased dramatically due to the improvement of infant formulas and vitamin D supplementation. In these countries, most infants that present with hypocalcemic seizures have underlying endocrinological etiologies rather than dietary insufficiencies.

Here, we describe three cases of neonatal seizures due to hypocalcemia. Although the symptoms and calcium concentrations at presentation were similar in all three cases, the course of the disease and the final diagnosis for each were distinct. The cases are presented along with a brief review of the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal hypocalcemia.

### Relationship of vitamin D deficiency and intraoperative parathyroid hormone elevation in completion and total thyroidectomy [^111qRund]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify how frequently intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels increase during thyroid surgery and to explore a possible relationship between secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency and elevation in intraoperative parathyroid hormone.

The study design was a case series with chart review, set in a tertiary academic center. A total of 428 consecutive patients undergoing completion and total thyroidectomy by the senior author over a 7-year period were included for analysis. All patients had baseline and post-excision intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels, as well as vitamin D levels from the same laboratory. The Institute of Medicine criteria were employed for vitamin D stratification (> 30 ng/mL considered normal; 20–29.9 ng/mL insufficient; < 20 ng/mL deficient). Other data analyzed included sex, age, neck dissection status, and parathyroid autotransplantation.

The results showed that a total of 118 patients (27.6%) had an intraoperative parathyroid hormone elevation above baseline. Patients with vitamin D deficiency were significantly more likely to experience hormone elevation (P = 0.04). When parathyroid hormone levels rose, they increased by a mean of 32.1 pg/mL. Patients with vitamin D deficiency demonstrated significantly larger hormone increases (P = 0.03).

In conclusion, elevation in intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels above baseline occurs in over one-fourth of cases after completion and total thyroidectomy and is significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. This study is the first to report this observation. We hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency in these patients…

### Severe vitamin D deficiency: a significant predictor of early hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy [^116my3yR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the role of preoperative serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D as a predictor of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in a university teaching hospital. All total and completion thyroidectomies performed from February 2007 to December 2013 were reviewed using hospital databases and patient charts. The study evaluated the relationship between post-thyroidectomy laboratory hypocalcemia (serum calcium ≤ 2 mmol/L), clinical hypocalcemia, and preoperative serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels.

Two hundred thirteen patients were analyzed. The incidence of postoperative laboratory and clinical hypocalcemia was 19.7% and 17.8%, respectively. Among patients with varying serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels, the incidences of laboratory hypocalcemia versus clinical hypocalcemia were as follows: severely deficient (< 25 nmol/L) at 54% versus 33.9%, deficient (< 50 nmol/L) at 10% versus 18%, insufficient (< 75 nmol/L) at 2.9% versus 11.6%, and sufficient (≥ 75 nmol/L) at 3.1% versus 0%. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified preoperative severe vitamin D deficiency as a significant independent predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia (odds ratio [OR], 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–22.9; p = 0.001). Additionally, parathyroid hormone level was also found to be an independent predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8; p = 0.002).

Postoperative clinical and laboratory hypocalcemia is significantly associated with low levels of serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D. Our findings identify severe vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/L) as a significant risk factor for developing postoperative hypocalcemia.

### Preoperative vitamin D deficiency predicts postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy [^1131EVpL]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Transient post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia occurs in up to 30% of patients. We evaluated the effect of vitamin D deficiency on post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

- **Methods**: Data were collected prospectively between January 2006 and March 2009. A total of 166 consecutive total thyroidectomies were analyzed regarding the relation between preoperative vitamin D3 levels and postoperative corrected calcium levels. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the preoperative vitamin D3 level:
	- **Group 1**: 50 nmol/l (conversion factor of 2.5× between nanomoles per liter and nanograms per milliliter). Hypocalcemia was defined as a postoperative calcium level of < 2.00 mmol/l.

- **Results**: Vitamin D3 deficiency was significantly associated with postoperative hypocalcemia. Patients with a preoperative vitamin D3 level of < 25 nmol/l (< 10 ng/ml) had a higher incidence of hypocalcemia compared to those with levels of > 50 nmol/l (> 20 ng/ml) (P = 0.025). Vitamin D3 deficiency was also associated with a longer hospital stay (median stay 2 days vs. 1 day, P < 0.05). When comparing high-risk and low-risk patients based on vitamin D3 levels, those with deficiency had a significantly higher risk of hypocalcemia and prolonged hospitalization.

Vitamin D deficiency contributes to delayed discharge due to a higher likelihood of hypocalcemia.

Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism, such as vitamin D deficiency, should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with Fosamax. Presumably due to the effects of Fosamax on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. This is especially true in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased. Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in these patients.

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes Fosamax (alendronate). Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping; however, a subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

### Correction of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients - VITdAL@ICU study protocol of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial [^113QTgD8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Calcium homeostasis and bone turnover

In critically ill patients, hypocalcemia is frequently present and has been related to increased morbidity and mortality. The reasons for hypocalcemia are not well understood, but elevated levels of IL-6 and vitamin D deficiency may play a decisive role. Without correction of vitamin D deficiency, calcium levels may be impossible to normalize. To maintain serum calcium levels, parathyroid hormone levels rise and induce accelerated bone resorption, which is aggravated by prolonged immobilization, ultimately resulting in significant bone loss. Interestingly, even relatively low doses of intravenous vitamin D (500 IU daily) might be able to attenuate this detrimental physiological response.

- **Cardiovascular system**: The heart is an important target organ for vitamin D, both on a genomic and nongenomic level. Cardiomyocytes express the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Severe hypocalcemia may cause life-threatening, reversible heart failure. Vitamin D appears to inhibit activation of the renin-angiotensin system as well as the expression of genes involved in the development of myocardial hypertrophy. There is accumulating evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be an important factor in the development of congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In chronic hemodialysis patients, calcitriol supplementation is associated with a reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and a reduction of QT dispersion, the latter being considered a major risk factor for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.

Our group found a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with NT-pro-BNP levels and NYHA classification.

### Nutritional vitamin D deficiency presenting as hemichorea [^1129mTao]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The authors describe a pediatric patient with repaired hypoplastic left heart syndrome who developed protein-losing enteropathy, hypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, and hemichorea. After correcting the nutritional vitamin D deficiency with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the chorea resolved. Hypoalbuminemia also improved after the correction of vitamin D deficiency, without requiring albumin infusions. This report additionally raises the possible role of calcium or vitamin D in the intestinal loss of albumin in protein-losing enteropathy.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend following the IOM nutritional guidelines for calcium intake. This includes 800 mg/day for women under 50 years and men under 70 years and 1,000 mg/day for women 50 years or older and men 70 years or older.

### Prolia [^115ZQPwk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prolia can cause severe hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. It is critical to correct pre-existing hypocalcemia before initiating therapy with Prolia. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Patients without advanced chronic kidney disease**:
	- In individuals predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. those with a history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of the small intestine, or treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), it is important to assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to 14 days following a Prolia injection. Some postmarketing cases have shown that hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months, requiring frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

- **Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease**:
	- Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (i.e. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), including those who are dialysis-dependent, are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following Prolia administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events, and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia, and the use of calcimimetic drugs concomitantly may also worsen the risk.

To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, appropriate interventions and close monitoring are necessary.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: A narrative review [^116qwvag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

There are several unanswered questions, and further studies are necessary. For example, hypocalcemia has been reported in patients with viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Ebola-virus. However, the mechanism and the natural course of this hypocalcemia have not been well characterized.

The mechanism underlying the profound increase in bone mass in hypoparathyroidism is not clearly understood. PTH treatment improves several symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with hypoparathyroidism; however, it is not completely understood whether this improvement is caused by direct actions of PTH on various tissues or by better control of serum calcium (s-Ca) levels. It is not clear what the optimal s-Ca levels are for a given patient, as some patients complain of symptoms even when s-Ca is normal. It is possible that the lack of PTH accounts for such problems.

Many etiologies for hypoparathyroidism have been identified, but the pathogenesis is unexplained in a large number of patients. The term idiopathic or primary hypoparathyroidism is still used in the literature because it is difficult to determine the etiologies in all cases of hypoparathyroidism. Future research should address as-yet unknown causes of this disease. The value of emerging technologies and intraoperative assessment of parathyroid viability on the functionality of the parathyroid glands after surgical manipulation merits further assessment.

### Vitamin D3 deficiency is associated with late-onset hypocalcemia after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in a vitamin D borderline area [^116p1BxD]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D3 deficiency is common in primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). We aimed to examine the clinicopathologic features and short-term outcomes of vitamin D3-deficient patients after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP).

- **Methods**: Over a 2-year period, 80 consecutive MIP patients had preoperative fasting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) measured. Forty-five patients had a 25OHD3 level < 20 ng/ml and 35 patients had a 25OHD3 level ≥ 20 ng/ml. Postoperatively, patients were monitored for late-onset hypocalcemia (LOH), defined as calcium levels < 8.5 mg/dl occurring 24 hours after surgery.

- **Results**: Late-onset hypocalcemia occurred in 15 of 45 vitamin D3-deficient patients compared to 0 of 35 patients with adequate vitamin D3 levels (p = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D3 deficiency was associated with a higher preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and a greater risk of LOH after MIP.

### Screening of vitamin D and calcium concentrations in neonates of mothers at high risk of vitamin D deficiency [^112MGewS]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD)) deficiency is a global health problem and, together with poor calcium intake, is responsible for nutritional rickets and osteomalacia. When severe, it leads to fractures and skeletal deformities in growing infants and children, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic hypocalcemia in the form of cardiomyopathy, tetany, and seizures. Although vitamin D is primarily required to maintain serum calcium homeostasis, there is increasing evidence that it may play a role in many other metabolic and physiological processes beyond maintaining bone health.

Vitamin D deficiency is especially prevalent during pregnancy in women with dark skin pigmentation and/or reduced ultraviolet radiation exposure due to ethno-cultural factors such as modest/concealed clothing, application of sunscreen, or less outdoor activity due to chronic illness and obesity. The re-emergence of nutritional rickets in countries like Australia is not surprising due to increased immigration and diversity of ethnic groups, resulting in a high proportion of the population being at high risk of vitamin D and calcium deficiency.

- **Risk factors**: The risk of nutritional rickets is greatest when vitamin D deficiency and dietary calcium deficiency are combined. If a child is deficient in only vitamin D or calcium, adequate bone mineralization can still be sustained. An exception to this is neonates and infants, who are growing rapidly and need both adequate vitamin D and calcium intake for bone mineralization.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^116ZsM5f]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Infantile hypercalcemia, type 1, caused by defects in CYP24A1 affects individuals throughout life, despite the name of the disease. It usually causes nephrolithiasis and is especially problematic in pregnant females due to the placental production of 1,25(OH)2D3, which cannot be efficiently metabolized. The utility of measuring 24-hydroxylated forms, particularly the 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)2D ratio, has been established as a useful screening tool by groups worldwide. Ratios are elevated from 5 to 25 in normal individuals to more than 80 in those affected by infantile hypercalcemia. It is important to recognize that this same enzymatic defect can be identified in adults with unexplained 1,25(OH)2D-dependent hypercalcemia. These individuals present with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones, and suppressed levels of PTH.

- **Other hypercalcemias**: Many causes of hypercalcemia can be distinguished by their distinctive pattern of vitamin D metabolites. Kaufmann et al. identified several patient groups by studying the vitamin D metabolome, including patients with Williams syndrome exhibiting an elevated level of 25(OH)D-26,23-lactone, a stable metabolite with high affinity for DBP. Patients with hypervitaminosis D taking toxic doses of vitamin D exhibit very high 25(OH)D but suppressed 1,25(OH)2D, with several other vitamin D metabolites potentially contributing.

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Many studies have documented a fall in serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D with a decline in renal function.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: Present and future [^112mCDFU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused on maintaining serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences, including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D, along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handling of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness, help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

### Controversies in vitamin D: Summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed:

- **Vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D**
- **Skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D**
- **Therapeutics of vitamin D**:

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference. Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge can continue to expand.

### Vitamin D-binding protein modifies the vitamin D-bone mineral density relationship [^1115CLtR]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with decreased calcium absorption and elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which may lead to excessive bone resorption. In some observational studies, higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have been linked to increased bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased risk of fracture. Additionally, several randomized, controlled trials suggest that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of fracture and increases BMD. However, not all observational studies have confirmed the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and BMD, especially in younger populations or racial minorities. Moreover, in several randomized trials, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD or fracture risk has been modest, absent, or reversed.

The free hormone hypothesis postulates that only hormones liberated from binding proteins enter cells and produce biologic action. 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] circulate bound to vitamin D-binding protein (85% to 90%) and albumin (10% to 15%), with less than 1% of circulating hormone in its free form. In mice, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) prolongs the serum half-life of 25(OH)D and protects against vitamin D deficiency by serving as a vitamin D reservoir. However, DBP also limits the biologic activity of injected 1,25(OH)2D3 in mice and inhibits the action of vitamin D on monocytes and keratinocytes in vitro. The significance of circulating DBP levels with regard to vitamin D's biologic action in humans is unclear.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: A rare but important cause of hypocalcaemia [^113aZHxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We present a 46-year-old Caucasian lady with symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Investigations revealed markedly raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with vitamin D deficiency. A number of conditions causing secondary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out from her medical history and initial investigations. The main differential diagnoses were vitamin D deficiency and PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). With high-normal serum phosphate and normal alkaline phosphatase, and a lack of symptoms associated with osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency alone was unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcaemia. Given a normal physical appearance, genetic testing was arranged and confirmed the diagnosis of PHP type Ib. She is currently taking activated vitamin D to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP, a rare complex genetic disorder, which can be easily missed, resulting in potentially serious consequences.

### Calcitriol [^1165jeuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Since calcitriol is the most potent metabolite of vitamin D available, prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld or used with caution during treatment to avoid the risk of hypercalcemia.

A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound should be used to control serum phosphorous levels in patients undergoing dialysis. Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous. Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis, and other soft tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg^2/dL^2. Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.

### A challenging case of hypocalcemia supporting the concept that 25-hydroxyvitamin D status is important for intestinal calcium absorption [^111Usgeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Intestinal mucosa seems to be responsive not only to circulating calcitriol but also to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.

- **Objective**: We report a complex patient with chronic kidney disease who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia (ionized calcium, 0.77 mmol/liter) despite regular calcitriol and calcium supplementation.

- **Methods**: Case history, laboratory evaluation, and bone biopsies are discussed.

- **Results**: Only vigorous treatment with intramuscular cholecalciferol led to a significant improvement in serum calcium, a decrease in PTH levels, and histological improvement of osteomalacic bone disease. However, oral anticoagulation became necessary for advanced peripheral artery disease, which precluded further intramuscular injections. Therefore, UVB phototherapy was initiated to treat vitamin D deficiency.

- **Conclusion**: This case is clinically relevant because it demonstrates that efficient calcium absorption is markedly reduced in profound vitamin D deficiency, even with normal active vitamin D levels. An important consequence is to stay aware of vitamin D deficiency in patients with compromised kidney function irrespective of regular calcitriol replacement. Second, when both parenteral and oral vitamin D administration are contraindicated, ineffective, or unavailable, UVB phototherapy is an effective option to treat vitamin D deficiency. Third, this case underlines the importance of obtaining regular 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in complex clinical cases when prediction of individual response is unreliable.

### Vitamin D and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^113vE7rs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the chronic kidney disease population. Vitamin D is often administered to patients to mitigate detrimental effects on bone health and mineral metabolism, though this treatment may be limited by elevations in serum calcium and phosphorus. This article reviews the basic physiology of vitamin D, the survival data in patients receiving vitamin D, and the quandary of whether vitamin D administration is beneficial in chronic kidney disease.

Despite potential increases in serum calcium and phosphorus due to activation of vitamin D receptors in the gut, vitamin D administration has been associated with a survival benefit in recent studies. While the mechanism for this possible benefit is unknown, vitamin D administration may have effects beyond its traditional role in mineral metabolism, mediated through the activation of vitamin D receptors distributed in a variety of tissues.

Data currently suggest that the administration of vitamin D confers a survival benefit to patients on dialysis. There is no clear mechanism, however, to explain this association. Further research is needed to clarify the expanding role of vitamin D receptor activation, particularly in vascular calcification, and the effects of the different forms of vitamin D.

### Stage I vitamin D-deficiency rickets mimicking pseudohypoparathyroidism type II [^114zbc3G]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation and biochemical features of stage I vitamin D-deficiency rickets (VDR) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type II are quite similar. These two entities have therefore often been mistaken for one another. We report our experience with two cases of stage I VDR that were originally diagnosed as PHP type II. This report provides insight into the pathophysiology of VDR and PHP, allowing for better differentiation between the two disease entities. It has become essential for pediatricians to recognize VDR due to its resurgence in developed countries.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Unsurprisingly, the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with or at risk of developing bone disease in the UK has led to controversy and confusion. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. This guideline has been designed to assist clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians, and other practicing health professionals, by providing key recommendations on the following:

- **Best way of estimating vitamin D status**: Recommendations for vitamin D testing; threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency.

- **Treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency**: Guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency; guidance on maintenance therapy; guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem with a plethora of conflicting guidance and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will contribute to better care and management of patients.

- **Key points**:
	- The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high worldwide, particularly in the elderly.
	- 25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD level of less than 30 nmol/L.
	- The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations; it has also been associated with many other conditions.
	- Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112taDcv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients.

Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified several risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels. It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed, and supplementation is initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer.

Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; the use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found similar results.

### Relationship between vitamin D deficiency and neonatal hypocalcemia: a meta-analysis [^114Zqtw3]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

We aimed to explore the associations of neonatal hypocalcemia with neonatal vitamin D deficiency and maternal vitamin D deficiency. A comprehensive systematic literature search using PubMed and Web of Science was performed for relevant articles from inception to February 17th, 2023. We used odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect sizes for our meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot, Begg's test, and Egger regression test. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0.

A total of 11 studies were included and analyzed, including 452 newborns with hypocalcemia and 2,599 newborns with normal serum calcium levels. Our research results revealed that vitamin D deficiency in newborns may be related to the higher prevalence of hypocalcemia (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.17–7.04). In addition, maternal vitamin D deficiency might also be a risk factor for neonatal hypocalcemia (OR: 7.83, 95% CI: 3.62–16.92). There was a significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and neonatal hypocalcemia. This meta-analysis indicates that newborns with vitamin D deficiency have a higher risk of hypocalcemia, and maternal vitamin D levels play a crucial role in this association. Vitamin D supplementation may have a positive effect in reducing the prevalence of neonatal hypocalcemia.
