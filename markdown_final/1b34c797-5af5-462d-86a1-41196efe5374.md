## Question

Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy, biopsy with sclerotic granuloma. Differentials

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a biopsy showing sclerotic granuloma, and to build a prioritized differential with next steps in evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sclerotic granuloma" implies histologically and how it constrains the differential. Then, I should verify the core diagnostic framework for sarcoidosis and the mandatory exclusions, especially infection. Next, I will prioritize the differential by likelihood and clinical impact, followed by a targeted diagnostic workup including stains, cultures, serologies, imaging, and the optimal biopsy strategy. Finally, I will outline initial management pathways contingent on the leading diagnosis and highlight pitfalls such as sarcoidosis–lymphoma syndrome and drug-induced granulomatous reactions, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the histologic anchor: "sclerotic granuloma" in a mediastinal node typically reflects a chronic granulomatous process with fibrosis, which immediately brings sarcoidosis, chronic infectious granulomatous disease (notably tuberculosis and histoplasmosis), fibrosing mediastinitis, and less commonly IgG4-related disease or other fibroinflammatory entities into play; I should double-check that necrosis status and organism stains were assessed because that will pivot the entire differential, as noncaseating granulomas favor sarcoidosis while caseating granulomas point to infection, and fibrosing mediastinitis often follows calcified granulomatous infection with dense collagen deposition and mediastinal structure encasement [^1146jqHR] [^115J2Ew6] [^114uqHqG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure the diagnostic framework is explicit. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires three elements: a compatible clinical-radiologic presentation, histologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and exclusion of alternative causes, especially infections and malignancy; I should confirm that the pathology report explicitly states noncaseating granulomas and that adequate special stains and cultures for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were performed, because even a single necrotic focus or positive stain would redirect me toward infection rather than sarcoidosis [^117Nt52a] [^112Libv5].

> Next, I should review the most likely diagnosis: sarcoidosis. Typical features include bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, noncaseating granulomas, and multisystem involvement; let me verify whether the imaging shows symmetric hilar adenopathy and whether there are any extrapulmonary clues such as skin, ocular, or hepatic disease, because these would strengthen the case and reduce the need for additional invasive sampling once infection is excluded; I should also remember that rare variants can show necrosis, so I must not overcall necrosis as incompatible with sarcoidosis without organism stains and cultures being negative [^117Buki6] [^116cjby2] [^115xV4xe].

> But wait, what if the granulomas are caseating or the patient is from a high TB-burden setting; tuberculosis must be actively excluded. I need to check AFB stains, mycobacterial culture, and consider IGRA or TST in the right epidemiologic context; I should confirm that the pathology team performed these stains and that cultures were requested, because missing TB would be a critical error and would change therapy entirely from immunosuppression to anti-tuberculous treatment [^117Buki6] [^1128H5Vv] [^113hcPQ7].

> I will now examine histoplasmosis and fibrosing mediastinitis as a key alternative, especially in endemic regions or when there is dense mediastinal fibrosis with calcifications and vascular or airway compromise. Let me verify whether the CT shows infiltrative soft tissue with calcification and compression of mediastinal structures, and whether there is a history of prior granulomatous infection; FDG-PET can be variably avid in active fibrosing mediastinitis, and the disease often reflects a granulomatous, sclerosing response to Histoplasma rather than ongoing infection, which has implications for avoiding unnecessary antifungals and focusing on structural management if symptomatic [^1146jqHR] [^115J2Ew6] [^112TNWxU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "sclerotic granuloma" might directly imply IgG4-related disease, but I should double-check that assumption; IgG4-related lymphadenopathy typically shows a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with storiform fibrosis and an elevated IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio, so I need to request IgG4 immunostaining and serum IgG4 if clinical and imaging features suggest it, recognizing that pattern 5 nodal change in IgG4-RD can mimic sclerosing disease and that multiorgan involvement should be sought [^114uqHqG] [^115Lcsf6].

> I need to ensure malignancy is not overlooked, particularly lymphoma, because it can coexist or mimic sarcoidosis. Let me review the imaging distribution and PET avidity; symmetric bilateral hilar and mediastinal uptake with a lower SUVmax may favor sarcoidosis, but there is no SUV threshold that reliably distinguishes lymphoma, so if there are atypical features, discordant nodes, B symptoms, or extranodal disease, I should pursue additional tissue with architecture-preserving biopsy and consider flow cytometry; I should also keep sarcoidosis–lymphoma syndrome in mind, where patients with sarcoidosis have an increased risk of lymphoma and may require repeated or deeper sampling if the course is atypical [^1167ggxJ] [^116EARgD] [^notfound].

> Let me consider other granulomatous infections and entities I must exclude before labeling sarcoidosis: coccidioidomycosis in the right geography, atypical mycobacteria, and drug-induced granulomatous reactions including immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated sarcoid-like disease; I should confirm exposure risks, medication history, and timing of new therapies, and if a sarcoid-like reaction is suspected in an oncology patient, I should avoid prematurely escalating cancer therapy until tissue confirms granulomas without malignancy [^112s3sNT] [^115yXyXU].

> Next, I should review the optimal diagnostic strategy for tissue confirmation and exclusion of alternatives. EBUS-guided nodal sampling is preferred initially for mediastinal nodes because it achieves high diagnostic yield for sarcoidosis and can obtain material for stains and cultures; if EBUS is nondiagnostic or lymphoma remains strongly suspected, mediastinoscopy offers higher yield and better architecture for subtyping, and emerging bronchoscopic forceps or cryobiopsy techniques may improve benign disease yield, though evidence is still evolving; I should confirm that the pathology request explicitly includes AFB and fungal stains and that appropriate cultures were sent [^114UoqtB] [^113GP4hG] [^111xXwj9].

> I should double-check adjunctive tests that refine pretest probabilities: serum ACE can support sarcoidosis but is nonspecific, calcium should be measured given hypercalcemia risk, and PET/CT helps assess activity and extrathoracic disease; however, I must not rely on PET features alone to distinguish sarcoidosis from lymphoma or infection, and I should integrate distribution, clinical context, and histology before concluding [^117Buki6] [^1167ggxJ].

> Now, I will outline management contingencies while I await confirmatory data. If sarcoidosis is confirmed with noncaseating granulomas and negative infection workup, many patients with isolated nodal disease do not require treatment, but I should screen for ocular, cardiac, and renal involvement and treat if there is significant symptoms, progressive disease, or risk organ involvement; if TB is diagnosed, I must initiate standard anti-tuberculous therapy and avoid steroids initially; if fibrosing mediastinitis is identified, management is primarily supportive and interventional for compression rather than anti-fungal therapy unless there is active histoplasmosis; if lymphoma is found, I should proceed with hematologic staging and oncologic management rather than immunosuppression [^117Buki6] [^1146jqHR] [^1114x662].

> Hold on, I should verify key pitfalls to avoid misdiagnosis: assuming necrosis excludes sarcoidosis (rare necrosis can occur, so stains/cultures are decisive), relying on PET SUV to separate lymphoma from sarcoidosis (overlap is substantial), and failing to consider coexisting lymphoma in patients with atypical evolution or splenomegaly; maintaining a low threshold to re-biopsy or pursue deeper sampling when the clinical course deviates from expectations is prudent [^115xV4xe] [^1167ggxJ] [^116EARgD].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis if granulomas are noncaseating and infection studies are negative, but I must actively exclude tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, consider IgG4-related disease if sclerosing features and appropriate immunostaining are present, and remain vigilant for lymphoma or drug-induced sarcoid-like reactions; a structured, reference-aligned workup with EBUS sampling, targeted stains and cultures, and judicious use of imaging and ancillary tests will minimize error and guide appropriate therapy [^117Buki6] [^1146jqHR] [^114UoqtB].

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with sclerotic granuloma on biopsy most often reflects **sarcoidosis** [^117Buki6] or **fibrosing mediastinitis** from prior histoplasmosis or tuberculosis [^1146jqHR] [^115J2Ew6], but the differential is broad and requires exclusion of infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease [^111Lj1sM] [^112tYnhY]. Key next steps include **special stains and cultures** for AFB/fungi [^1128H5Vv], **PET/CT** to assess activity and guide further sampling [^1167ggxJ], and **clinical correlation** to identify systemic features or exposures [^116EJVzK]. Management is diagnosis-specific: sarcoidosis may need steroids or observation [^111Lj1sM] [^117Buki6]; fibrosing mediastinitis may require intervention for compression [^115J2Ew6]; infections need targeted therapy [^116EJVzK] [^1114x662]; lymphoma requires oncologic treatment.

Pathophysiology

Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM), also known as sclerosing mediastinitis, is a condition related to an abnormal immunologic reaction that results in the proliferation of fibro-inflammatory tissue in the mediastinum and/or hila. It leads to a variable constriction of systemic veins, pulmonary arteries and veins, the airways and/or the esophagus, with a morbidity related to location and extent of fibrosis. The pleura, pericardium, and coronary arteries may also be involved.

Table 1
Fibrosing mediastinitis and differential diagnoses

Granulomatous subtype

The most common form is the focal or granulomatous subtype of fibrosing mediastinitis, mainly due to histoplasmosis (less frequently tuberculosis), and other fungal or inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis. This form usually manifests as a localized, calcified mass in the paratracheal or subcarinal regions of the mediastinum or in the pulmonary hila, commonly responsible for a superior vena cava syndrome. Diagnosis can be made based on imaging findings, preventing the need for tissue sampling.

Conclusion

In conclusion, non-malignant diffuse mediastinal disease presents with various characteristics, depending on the mechanism involved. The differential diagnosis calls for a systematic approach that includes the patient's history and habits, excludes a tracheobronchial or esophageal injury in acute conditions, and requires a careful and precise histological examination in diffuse mediastinal tissue infiltration.

Diagnostic Testing

Question 1: Should Lymph Node Sampling Be Performed in a Patient Presenting with Asymptomatic Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy?

Rationale for question

Isolated involvement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a common presentation of sarcoidosis, and is readily detected by a routine chest X-ray. Many such patients are asymptomatic, and sarcoidosis is only suspected on the basis of radiographic testing for an unrelated reason. Patients with sarcoidosis with asymptomatic lymph node involvement generally have self-limited disease, and do not require treatment. However, the finding of enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes during radiographic testing is often alarming to healthcare providers and patients alike, primarily out of concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as occult malignancy or latent infection. Previous studies have reported that asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is almost always caused by sarcoidosis, and, given the benign nature of this phenotype, there is clinical equipoise for pursuing diagnostic sampling in such patients.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 2,106 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 75 was reviewed. One study reported enrolling patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so the panel decided to separately consider 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis. The study that enrolled patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy confirmed sarcoidosis in 72% (95% confidence interval, 61–81%), but found lymphoma in 10% (95% CI, 5.3–19%) and other diagnoses (i.e. nonlymphomatous malignancy, silicosis, fibrosis, and amyloidosis) in 7.7% (95% CI, 3.6–15.8%). The 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis collectively included 556 patients who underwent at least 1 sampling procedure. Sarcoidosis was confirmed in 85% (95% CI, 82–88%) of patients, an alternative diagnosis was made in 1.9% (95% CI, 1–3.7%) of patients, and sampling was nondiagnostic in 11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of patients. Among the alternative diagnoses, 38% (95% CI, 14–69%) were TB and 25% (95% CI, 7.1–59%) were lymphoma. The only complication reported was a case of mediastinitis that occurred after an esophageal endoscopic ultrasound procedure.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### The diagnosis of sarcoidosis [^113TpXT3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the diagnostic approach to sarcoidosis. There is no gold standard diagnostic test, procedure or algorithm for sarcoidosis. The diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical presentation, histologic findings of granulomatous inflammation, exclusion of alternative diseases, and evidence of systemic involvement. Occasionally, there may be exceptions to several of these requirements.

Recent Findings

The diagnostic specificity of several specific clinical features are discussed. Typical histologic findings of sarcoidosis are described. Several diseases that may mimic sarcoidosis are reviewed.

Summary

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis usually involves weighing the clinical evidence for and against the diagnosis, coupled in most cases with histologic evidence of granulomatous inflammation. This approach requires knowledge of the varied presentations of the disease and other alternative conditions as well as histologic examination of an affected tissue in most instances.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^113hcPQ7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mediastinal masses are routinely encountered in clinical practice and a wide range of differential diagnoses must be considered. A less common cause is tuberculosis, a disease recognized for its atypical presentations attributed to its ability to affect almost any organ system. Tuberculosis has an incidence of 126 per 100,000 according to the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO). Mycobacterium tuberculosis undergoes lympho-heamatogenous dissemination after entering the respiratory tract. Typically the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are the first lymphatic tissues M. tuberculosis will encounter and it may then spread to other organ systems. Thirty percent of patients present with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, an example of which is illustrated by this case.

### Sarcoidosis from head to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^116cjby2]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder characterized by development of noncaseating granulomas in various organs. Although the etiology of this condition is unclear, environmental and genetic factors may be substantial in its pathogenesis. Clinical features are often nonspecific, and imaging is essential to diagnosis. Abnormalities may be seen on chest radiographs in more than 90% of patients with thoracic sarcoidosis. Symmetric hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and pulmonary micronodules in a perilymphatic distribution are characteristic features of sarcoidosis. Irreversible pulmonary fibrosis may be seen in 25% of patients with the disease. Although sarcoidosis commonly involves the lungs, it can affect virtually any organ in the body. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/CT are useful in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, but imaging features may overlap with those of other conditions. Familiarity with the spectrum of multimodality imaging findings of sarcoidosis can help to suggest the diagnosis and guide appropriate management. © RSNA, 2018.

OBJECTIVE. This article will review the typical and atypical imaging features of sarcoidosis, identify entities that may be mistaken for sarcoidosis, and discuss patterns and clinical scenarios that suggest an alternative diagnosis. CONCLUSION. Radiologists must be familiar with the characteristic findings in sarcoidosis and be attentive to situations that suggest alternative diagnoses. The radiologist plays a major role in prompt diagnosis and one that may help reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

Question 2: Should Patients with Suspected Sarcoidosis and Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymphadenopathy, for Whom It Has Been Determined That Tissue Sampling Is Necessary, Undergo EBUS-guided Lymph Node Sampling or Mediastinoscopy as the Initial Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymph Node Sampling Procedure?

Rationale for question

Tissue sampling is often helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected sarcoidosis. It begins with the least-risky and least-invasive method, such as sampling skin or peripheral lymph node (e.g. axillary lymph node) abnormalities suggestive of sarcoidosis. However, most new sarcoidosis cases lack skin and peripheral lymph node findings, and invasive testing is pursued from the start. Superiority of EBUS-guided lymph node sampling over transbronchial lung biopsy in pulmonary sarcoidosis has already been established. The committee asked whether EBUS-guided lymph node sampling or mediastinoscopy is preferable.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 703 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 64 was reviewed and 29 were selected. There were no studies comparing EBUS-guided sampling to mediastinoscopy; all studies were nonrandomized studies that reported the diagnostic yield and other outcomes of either EBUS-guided lymph node sampling (,–) or mediastinoscopy (,–) in patients with suspected sarcoidosis.

EBUS-guided lymph node sampling had a diagnostic yield of 87% (95% CI, 94–91%). Among the diagnostic samples, 98% confirmed sarcoidosis and 2% found an alternative diagnosis, including lymphoma, TB, and lung cancer. There were no reported major complications of EBUS, and only one case of post-procedure stridor, yielding a reported complication rate of < 0.1%. Only one mediastinoscopy study (published in 2006) reported outcomes in the same fashion as the EBUS studies; it found that mediastinoscopy had a diagnostic yield of 98% (95% CI, 90–100%). Among the diagnostic samples, 91% confirmed sarcoidosis and 9% found reactive lymphadenopathy. The other mediastinoscopy studies (all published before 1970) reported that 96% (95% CI, 94–97%) of procedures confirmed sarcoidosis, and the remaining 4% (95% CI, 3–6%) found an alternative diagnosis or were nondiagnostic.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^1167ggxJ]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary disease can occur with or without concomitant lymphadenopathy and is classically characterized by bilateral micronodules clustered in a perilymphatic distribution with an upper to middle lobe predominance (Fig. 4d). These nodules demonstrate moderate FDG uptake on PET/CT. Severity of pulmonary involvement on CT and as assessed by PFTs correlates well with FDG activity. With long-standing disease, irreversible pulmonary fibrosis occurs in up to 25% of cases.

Osseous involvement occurs in 1–13% of cases and is seen in those with a more prolonged course. The lesions may be lytic or sclerotic and are FDG-avid (Fig. 4b and c). Cardiac involvement occurs in 25% of patients, most commonly affecting the left ventricular myocardium. Active cardiac sarcoidosis can be evaluated by FDG-PET/CT in patients who adhere to a high fat, high protein, and low carbohydrate diet prior to scanning. Patchy focal and occasionally diffuse FDG uptake is compatible with cardiac sarcoidosis (Fig. 4e). This imaging modality is crucial in the diagnosis and follow-up in patients with pacemakers/AICD, as many are precluded from undergoing MRI examination. It additionally is important in evaluating treatment response in sarcoidosis patients (Fig. 4e, f).

Lymphoma is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis, particularly given the increased incidence of lymphoproliferative diseases in sarcoidosis patients. FDG-PET/CT is unable to distinguish between lymphoma and sarcoidosis based on SUV max alone. An additional challenge in image interpretation is the occurrence of sarcoid-like reactions in a minority of patients who have known malignancies and/or receive immune checkpoint inhibitors. These patients can develop FDG-avid mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and/or pulmonary disease that simulate sarcoidosis. There are no statistically significant differences in imaging findings for sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like reactions. This reaction is important to consider, as it can easily be mistaken for worsening metastatic disease. In differentiating the two entities, SUV max alone is not useful. However, a pattern of symmetric, bilateral mediastinal, and hilar nodal uptake on PET/CT can suggest sarcoid-like reaction over malignancy. Furthermore, sarcoid-like reaction lymph nodes are typically larger, demonstrate an overall lower nodal volume, and are more likely to occur in younger females compared with malignancy.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Nt52a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability. Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality. Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.

### Fibrosing mediastinitis: an unusual cause of pulmonary symptoms [^11177A9R]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM), also known as granulomatous or sclerosing mediastinitis, is an uncommon but serious cause of chest symptoms. Due to an infectious or inflammatory challenge, production of collagen occurs in the confined space of the mediastinum. Collagen formation leads to compression of vital structures, resulting in cough, chest pain and dyspnea. The majority of cases of FM occur as a result of prior exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum. The following is a case of a previously healthy young woman who presented with a 3-month history of cough, chest pain and trouble breathing, and was subsequently found to have fibrosing mediastinitis. Fibrosing mediastinitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough, chest pain and dyspnea, primarily when findings such as increased venous pressure are present on physical exam and hilar abnormalities are seen on chest radiograph. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of fibrosing mediastinitis are discussed.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^112KSpRG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is a common challenge in clinical practice, with a wide range of differential diagnosis to be considered. One of the rarer causes is tuberculosis. Atypical presentations of tuberculosis are well documented in immunocompromised patients, but should also be considered in the immunocompetent.

Case presentation

This case outlines a previously healthy 22 year-old immunocompetent male presenting with worsening chest pain, positional dyspnea, dry cough and dysphagia. Chest x-ray showed evidence of an isolated anterior mediastinal mass, which was confirmed on computed tomography. A mediastinoscopy was diagnostic as histology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and the presence of acid-fast bacilli, indicating mediastinal tuberculosis.

Conclusion

Typically the underlying presentation of mediastinal tuberculosis is mediastinal lymphadenitis. This case was unusual in that we detected an isolated large anterior mediastinal mass accompanied by a relatively small burden of mediastinal lymphadenitis. Cases similar to this have been documented in immunosuppressed patients however in our case no evidence of immunosuppression was found. This case report emphasizes the importance that a detailed and logical pathway of investigation is pursued when encountering a mediastinal mass.

### Sarcoidosis: challenging diagnostic aspects of an old disease [^115KUpSS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis. Conversely, the etiology of the disease remains obscure for a number of reasons, including heterogeneity of clinical manifestations, often overlapping with other disorders, and insensitive and nonspecific diagnostic tests. While no cause has been definitely confirmed, there is increasing evidence that one or more infectious agents may cause the disease, although the organism may no longer be viable. Here we present 2 cases, in which sarcoidosis preceded tuberculosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Development of new lesions in a patient with chronic/remitting sarcoidosis should be looked at with suspicion and promptly investigated in order to rule out an alternative/concomitant diagnosis. In such cases, tissue confirmation from the most accessible site, and bone marrow biopsy-if lymphoma is in the differential diagnosis-should be performed. In conclusion, we strongly advise that physicians be ready to reconsider the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in the presence of atypical manifestations or persistent/progressive disease despite conventional therapy.

### Neurosarcoidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115xV4xe]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Biopsy

Diagnostic confidence of NS is greatest when there is biopsy confirmation of sarcoidosis in the nervous system (what is termed definite neurosarcoidosis in the 2018 consensus diagnostic criteria); however, in some cases, the neuroanatomic localization may preclude biopsy due to concerns about morbidity or opportunity to secure a diagnosis by less invasive means. In such cases, it may be preferable to establish the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis in the context of a neurologic syndrome consistent with NS (probable neurosarcoidosis). When there is evidence of concurrent pulmonary sarcoidosis, a tissue sample can usually be acquired by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsy of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy with a high diagnostic yield; mediastinoscopy may be required in some cases depending on the affected anatomy. Comprehensive skin and eye examination should be pursued as either may reveal systemic evidence of sarcoidosis via relatively noninvasive biopsy. There should be caution when relying on skin biopsy as the only pathologic foundation to support the sarcoidosis diagnosis given the broad differential diagnosis of cutaneous granulomas and granulomatous dermatitis, as well as caution relying solely on superficial lymph node biopsy. In cases in which body imaging is unrevealing, biopsy of a neurologic target may be necessary to exclude malignancy or other etiologies.

Although sarcoidosis granulomas are generally non-necrotizing and any necrotizing granulomas or poorly formed granulomas should raise caution about sarcoidosis as the final diagnosis, in bona fide sarcoidosis, there can sometimes be rare areas of necrosis on biopsy, particularly in larger samples. Sarcoidosis granulomas are not histologically distinct from other granulomatous conditions, and special staining for acid-fast bacilli, fungi, and cultures is important for excluding infectious etiologies.

### Mediastinal widening and miliary chest radiograph pattern in a middle aged man: could it be sarcoidosis? [^1164qCLS]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on suggestive radiographic pattern, presence of non-caseating granulomas and negative fungal and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures. Sarcoidosis usually presents with hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and distinct parenchymal radiographic patterns, such as fine nodular, reticulonodular or acinar opacities and rarely focal nodules or masses. A diffuse miliary pattern occurs in less than 1% of cases and can be identical to patterns seen in tuberculosis, fungal infections, histiocytosis and miliary metastases. Here the authors report the case of a 48-year-old man who presented with mediastinal widening and miliary pattern on chest radiograph, initially erroneously treated for tuberculosis. Transbronchial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serological tests were compatible with sarcoidosis, while BAL cultures were negative for fungi and AFB growth. The patient finally demonstrated clinical and radiological remission under corticosteroids. Clinicians should consider sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis when bilateral miliary-type lesions are revealed on chest X-ray.

### Pathology of sarcoidosis [^112tYnhY]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Pathologists are frequently involved in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis on conventional biopsies or examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and assisting bronchoscopists when performing bronchial or transbronchial biopsies or transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA)/endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsies of enlarged lymph nodes. Histology generally does not pose difficult tasks in the correct clinical and imaging scenario, but atypical forms of sarcoidosis exist, and in these cases, the diagnosis may become difficult. When faced with granulomas in the lung, the evaluation of their qualitative features, anatomic distribution, and accompanying findings usually allows the pathologist to narrow considerably the differential diagnosis. The final diagnosis always requires the careful integration of the histology with the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. How robust is the histologic component of the diagnosis varies from case to case, and the pathologist should always clearly discuss this point with the clinician; in general, the weaker the histology is, the stronger should be the clinical-radiologic findings, and vice versa. The differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis includes granulomatous infections, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, several collagen vascular diseases (particularly Sjögren), drug reactions, chronic aspiration, and even diffuse fibrosing diseases. In this review, conventional and unusual histologic findings of pulmonary sarcoidosis are presented, highlighting the role of the pathologist and discussing the main differential diagnoses.

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^117R15UG]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The patient is a middle-aged woman with acute-onset polyarthritis and tenosynovitis, acute anterior uveitis, hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple liver hypodensities with underlying granulomatous inflammation and lytic-sclerotic vertebral body lesions.

While there are many ways of approaching the clinical problem, we chose to evaluate the patient based on the differential diagnoses of systemic conditions that may result in widespread granulomatous inflammation. Box 1 illustrates how wide the range of possible differential diagnoses for liver granulomata can be.

Differential diagnosis for disseminated granulomatous inflammation

In our discussion for the relevant differential diagnoses in this clinical case, we have omitted discussions on drugs and reaction to foreign bodies as the patient had not been exposed to any of the drugs or elements in the past.

### IgG4-related lung disease as a differential diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disease: atypical presentation of an atypical disease [^112z2ZV5]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Initially, a malignant lymphoproliferative process with lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lung was considered as the most probable diagnosis. Given the extensive adenopathies, Castleman disease was also considered, although the lack of lymph node enhancement and the lung interstitial and mass-like involvement made it less likely.

A primary lung malignancy also seemed likely; in an older, heavy smoker patient with cough and weight loss, the suspicion of primary lung cancer should be high.

Lastly, although probably lower than lymphoproliferative diseases and lung cancer, sarcoidosis should be considered. It can typically cause lymphadenopathy (hilar, mediastinal and less typically extrapulmonary), interstitial changes and less often mass-like opacities.

### Transbronchial lymph node forceps biopsy as a novel tool in diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy: a pilot study [^111xXwj9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Differential diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is an issue of debate. Lymph nodes may be enlarged due to a variety of inflammatory, infectious, or malignant reasons. Therefore, obtaining samples from the affected nodes is crucial for the diagnosis. Usually, these patients are subjected to TBNA (EBUS or conventional) or mediastinoscopy if TBNA is not conclusive. This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of this new technique of transbronchial forceps biopsy for the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Methods

The study included 18 patients with confirmed mediastinal lymphadenopathy who were admitted in Chest Department, Cairo University in the period from December 2019 to December 2020. All patients were subjected to flexible bronchoscopy with conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (C-TBNA) and transbronchial forceps biopsy (LN-TBFB) from the enlarged mediastinal lymph node in the same procedure.

Results

we found the technique of LN-TBFB safe with no serious complications. We were able to reach a diagnosis in 7/7 (100%) cases of sarcoidosis, 6/7 (85.7%) cases of malignant lymph nodes. We had three cases where the histopathology showed hyperactive follicular hyperplasia, and a single case of tuberculous lymphadenitis. C-TBNA was diagnostic in 71.4% of sarcoidosis cases, 42.9% of malignant cases, but failed to diagnose the one patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis.

Conclusion

Lymph node transbronchial forceps biopsy (LN-TBFB) was found to be safe and effective in the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We strongly advocate the use of this minimally invasive technique for diagnosing pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, as a last step before mediastinoscopy.

### Mediastinal FDG-positive lymph nodes simulating melanoma progression: drug-induced sarcoidosis like / lymphadenopathy related to ipilimumab [^112s3sNT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reactions (DISRs) are systemic granulomatous diseases that develop in the context of a new drug onset. Ipilimumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma which has been associated with DISR. Differential diagnosis between tumour progression and DISR by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients treated with an ICI can be a challenge. A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with a stage IIIB melanoma in her back. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was initiated. After 1 month of finishing the treatment a routine, PET/CT showed multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes FDG-positive. A transbronchial biopsy showed sarcoid-like granulomatous infiltration which favoured the diagnosis of DISR related to ipilimumab. The patient remained asymptomatic and lymphadenopathy regressed progressively after 11 months. Our work highlights the importance of differentiating DISR from tumour progression, before unnecessary changes in therapeutic strategies. PET/CT is a useful diagnostic tool for its follow-up.

### Transbronchial lymph node forceps biopsy as a novel tool in diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy: a pilot study [^111eFnDu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The differential diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is an issue of debate. Lymph nodes may be enlarged due to variety of inflammatory, infectious, or malignant reasons. The diagnosis in cases of mediastinal and /or hilar lymphadenopathy with no lung parenchymal involvement is often difficult and requires obtaining specimen from the enlarged lymph nodes.

Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (C-TBNA) provides an opportunity to diagnose mediastinal lesions and to stage bronchogenic carcinoma in a minimally invasive fashion. The sensitivity of C-TBNA ranges from 69 to 90% but the sensitivity ranges from 37–89%. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is considered the investigation of choice for sampling mediastinal nodes. A major drawback of EBUS-TBNA is its lower diagnostic yield for lymphoma and benign diseases as well as its high cost especially in low income countries.

Lymph node transbronchial forceps biopsy (LN-TBFB) is a novel bronchoscopic sampling technique to improve the capability of obtaining tissue for histological examination from mediastinal lesions. LN-TBFB is safe and provides adequate histological specimens of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. LN-TBFB increases the diagnostic yield in benign conditions and may add value in molecular analysis of non-small cell lung cancer.

This pilot study was carried out to investigate the safety and feasibility of lymph node transbronchial forceps biopsy (LN-TBFB) as a new tool for diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the different etiologies.

### Cryptogenic organising pneumonia presenting with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^115uE4o1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cryptogenic organising pneumonia is not considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We submitted a patient presenting with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We suspected diagnosis of sarcoidosis, but the patient was diagnosed as cryptogenic organising pneumonia with the histological result. This is the second case report of cryptogenic organising pneumonia presenting with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

### Diagnosis and management of sarcoidosis [^111Lj1sM]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in any organ, most commonly the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis should be suspected in any young or middle-aged adult presenting with unexplained cough, shortness of breath, or constitutional symptoms, especially among blacks or Scandinavians. Diagnosis relies on three criteria: (1) a compatible clinical and radiologic presentation, (2) pathologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and (3) exclusion of other diseases with similar findings, such as infections or malignancy. An early and accurate diagnosis of sarcoidosis remains challenging, because initial presentations may vary, many patients are asymptomatic, and there is no single reliable diagnostic test. Prognosis is variable and depends on epidemiologic factors, mode of onset, initial clinical course, and specific organ involvement. The optimal treatment for sarcoidosis remains unclear, but corticosteroid therapy has been the mainstay of therapy for those with significantly symptomatic or progressive pulmonary disease or serious extrapulmonary disease. Refractory or complex cases may require immunosuppressive therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, some patients may develop life-threatening pulmonary, cardiac, or neurologic complications from severe, progressive disease. End-stage disease may ultimately require lung or heart transplantation for eligible patients.

### Imaging of sarcoidosis: a contemporary review [^115JrHif]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder with a variety of clinical presentations and radiological appearances. Although it primarily affects the lungs and lymphatics, sarcoidosis potentially involves essentially every organ system. On imaging, sarcoidosis can mimic different disease entities, including primary and metastatic neoplasms, vasculitis, and other granulomatous infections. Definitive diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical, radiological, and histologic information. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and evaluating response to therapy. This review covers imaging findings in sarcoidosis within each organ system, with an emphasis on the use of imaging in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

### Postradiation-associated sclerosing mediastinitis diagnosed in fine needle aspiration specimen: a cytological-pathological correlation [^112H5Yng]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Sclerosing mediastinitis (SM) is an aggressive fibroproliferative process in the mediastinum that may lead to encasement of mediastinal structures within a dense fibrotic mass. This disease may cause significant clinical complications, morbidity, and even mortality. The etiology and pathogenesis of SM is unclear and in more than one third of cases remains idiopathic. Among the known causes of SM, granulomatous infection is the commonest. Association of SM with radiation therapy has been rarely reported. Herein, we are reporting a case of postradiation sclerosing mediastinitis diagnosed in fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of postradiation sclerosing mediastinitis with unusual striking intracytoplasmic glycogen accumulation. Having high index of suspicion and awareness of the fact that this entity may be also associated with radiation therapy, will be helpful in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls in FNA specimens and guiding proper clinical management.

### An update on the minimally invasive diagnosis of lymphoma for the chest physicians [^1114x662]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy has a broad differential diagnosis which includes lymphoma. The current preferred biopsy technique for mediastinal lymph nodes is transbronchial needle aspiration which has mixed results in terms of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic yields; there are also limitations with subtyping lymphomas with needle aspiration alone which can be a barrier to determine management strategies. Invasive mediastinal lymph node sampling such was with mediastinoscopy provides higher yields and preserved lymph node architecture for both diagnosis and subtyping of lymphoma but carries a higher risk of morbidity and complications. Novel techniques that may increase the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of lymphoma are core biopsy needles, intranodal forcep biopsy, and intranodal cryobiopsy. The evidence is limited due to a relatively small number of cases, so further research is needed to standardize best practices for the bronchoscopic diagnosis of lymphoma. Pleural effusions in lymphoma can be present in up to 30% of cases with the majority being non-Hodgkins's lymphoma. The presence of exudative effusion in the setting of an existing or prior diagnosis of lymphoma should raise clinical suspicions. Other less common subtypes of lymphoma presenting as primary pleural effusions are explored as well.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111BfqA5]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact on mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

### Sclerosing thymoma [^112nwAkE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sclerosing thymoma is an extremely rare entity described mostly in the recent past and, to our knowledge, described in only 14 cases, including one we recently diagnosed at our institution. The pathogenesis and biologic behavior of this relatively unknown entity is still largely uncertain. However, there are several consistent findings among the cases described so far. It is mostly asymptomatic or patients may present with shortness of breath or chest pain due to a large, well-circumscribed mass in the anterior mediastinum. It has a characteristic homogeneously white-tan, solid cut surface without any necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic change. Microscopically, it is characterized by extensive sclerosis, hyalinization, and calcification. Only scant evidence of residual thymoma may be present to characterize this entity. Complete surgical resection has, so far, been curative. Knowledge of this rare entity in the general practice of surgical pathologists is important when considering the differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal lesions.

### Thoracic lymphadenopathies in diffuse systemic sclerosis: an observational study on 48 patients using computed tomography [^112ax7WL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other explorations

PET was performed in 15 patients (31.3%). Indications were the search for underlying neoplasia in 12 patients (80.0%), characterization of thoracic LAP for 2 patients (13.3%), and evaluation before heart transplant for 1 patient (6.7%). Lymph node hypermetabolism was found in 11/15 patients (73.3%), even in the absence of LAP for 4/15 patients (26.7%). SUVmax in overall PET was 4 ± 1.3 with a maximum at 6.

Four mediastinal lymph node biopsies and 1 aspiration cytology have been performed, always in case of neoplasia suspicion. Histological analysis never described granuloma nor tumoral cells. One biopsy revealed primary lymphoid follicles including small-sized lymphocytes with mature chromatin and discrete sinusal histiocytic aspect, one other revealed nonspecific small and medium-sized lymphocytes, and the two last were not contributive because of a lack of lymph node material. The aspiration cytology showed regular, small-sized, mature lymphocytes and anthracosis histiocytes.

### Granulomatous mediastinal adenopathy: can endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration differentiate between tuberculosis and sarcoidosis? [^11289RR7]. Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy may indicate diseases such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, and it is often difficult to establish a diagnosis when standard medical work-up is inconclusive. In this study we investigated the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the differentiation between tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.

Patients and Methods

In this prospective study, 72 consecutive patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, negative endoscopic investigations including bronchoscopic procedures, and no radiological evidence of lung cancer or other malignancies on computed tomography were enrolled. EUS-FNA and subsequent cytology, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli, and culture were performed. At least 12 months' follow-up including further investigations was included to exclude tuberculosis.

Results

Adequate samples were obtained from 71/72 patients (36 male; mean age 50.2 years). No complications occurred. The final diagnosis included 30 cases of sarcoidosis, 28 of tuberculosis, four malignancies, one abscess, and nine benign lymphadenopathies. The size of lymph nodes on EUS varied from 0.5 cm to 4.2 cm. Tuberculosis nodes were significantly smaller than those in sarcoidosis. Unrelated nodes were significantly smaller than in either tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of EUS-FNA for tuberculosis were 86%, 100%, 100%, and 91%, respectively; those for sarcoidosis were 100%, 93%, 91%, and 100%, respectively. For culture of tuberculosis, they were 71%, 100%, 100%, and 84%, respectively. EUS-FNA led to a definite diagnosis in 64/72 cases (89%) that had not been previously diagnosed by routine methods.

Conclusion

EUS-FNA offers a high diagnostic yield for the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis and sarcoidosis that have not been diagnosed by conventional methods.

### Imaging of granulomatous fibrosing mediastinitis [^112iYiEG]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review and illustrate the pathogenesis, natural history, imaging features, and treatment of granulomatous fibrosing mediastinitis.

Conclusion

Granulomatous fibrosing mediastinitis is an infiltrative disorder characterized by encasement of the mediastinal viscera; in most cases in the United States, it represents an idiosyncratic immune response to histoplasma. Familiarity with the various imaging features of fibrosing mediastinitis is important for prompt and accurate diagnosis as well as for planning and guiding surgical and less-invasive treatments.

### Role of EUS for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy [^114EwUry]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis with mediastinal adenopathy — scope of EUS/EBUS and sampling caveats. Because nodal tissue does not provide a specific diagnosis for sarcoidosis, the role of EUS and EBUS in diagnosing sarcoidosis is not defined. In many cases, EUS-FNA and EBUS-FNA are performed to exclude malignancy, but noncaseating granulomas are difficult to identify from FNA cytopathology; multiple passes for cell block may be helpful, and EUS with a large-bore needle to obtain histology has been described.

### Transcriptional profiling of endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node samples aids diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^115dBXQF]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsy is the mainstay for investigation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy for laboratory diagnosis of malignancy, sarcoidosis, or TB. However, improved methods for discriminating between TB and sarcoidosis and excluding malignancy are still needed. We sought to evaluate the role of genomewide transcriptional profiling to aid diagnostic processes in this setting.

Methods

Mediastinal lymph node samples from 88 individuals were obtained by EBUS-guided aspiration for investigation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and subjected to transcriptional profiling in addition to conventional laboratory assessments. Computational strategies were used to evaluate the potential for using the transcriptome to distinguish between diagnostic categories.

Results

Molecular signatures associated with granulomas or neoplastic and metastatic processes were clearly discernible in granulomatous and malignant lymph node samples, respectively. Support vector machine (SVM) learning using differentially expressed genes showed excellent sensitivity and specificity profiles in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with area under curve values > 0.9 for discriminating between granulomatous and nongranulomatous disease, TB and sarcoidosis, and between cancer and reactive lymphadenopathy. A two-step decision tree using SVM to distinguish granulomatous and nongranulomatous disease, then between TB and sarcoidosis in granulomatous cases, and between cancer and reactive lymphadenopathy in nongranulomatous cases, achieved > 90% specificity for each diagnosis and afforded greater sensitivity than existing tests to detect TB and cancer. In some diagnostically ambiguous cases, computational classification predicted granulomatous disease or cancer before pathologic abnormalities were evident.

Conclusions

Machine learning analysis of transcriptional profiling in mediastinal lymphadenopathy may significantly improve the clinical utility of EBUS-guided biopsies.

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^1118fjMb]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a rare chronic systemic inflammatory disorder, which is characterised by the formation of non-caseating granulomata. It has a highly variable clinical presentation and disease course, depending on the organ involvement.

Arriving at a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not a straightforward process. It is important that compatible clinical features are associated with histopathological findings of non-caseating granulomata in affected organs, and that other granulomatous disorders are excluded.

A wide range of differentials would need to be considered, again depending on patient population and clinical presentation. A rare case of multisystemic sarcoidosis, initially diagnosed as metastatic malignancy of unknown origin, is described here.

### Clinicoradiological course of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis with histology findings [^116P1hxc]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

For the differential diagnosis for multiple non-segmental GGOs and consolidation, drug-induced pneumonitis, radiation-induced pneumonitis, connective tissue disease-associated interstitial disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, infection, and sarcoidosis were considered.

The patient was treated for insomnia and seasonal allergic rhinitis with flunitrazepam and antihistamine for several years. Abemaciclib had been administered most recently. We could not identify any cause for hypersensitive pneumonitis based on her medical history and living environment. Her laboratory data, analysis of BAL and histology from lung biopsy were unlikely for eosinophilic pneumonia or infection. Her physical findings and autoantibodies for collagen vascular diseases did not suggest complication of collagen vascular diseases. Her chest CT did not reveal mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and no granuloma was seen in lung biopsy. Although the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test was negative, it was performed during the treatment with prednisolone and under the effect of prednisolone on lymphocytes; therefore, the result could have been false negative.

### Imaging features and differential diagnoses of non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases [^114V6hU8]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute or chronic non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases have multiple causes, degrees of severity, and a wide range of management. Some situations require emergency care while others do not need specific treatment. Although the diagnosis may be suspected on chest X-ray, it is mainly based on CT. A delayed recognition is not uncommonly observed. Some findings may prompt the radiologist to look for specific associated injuries or lesions.

This pictorial review will successively describe the various non-neoplastic causes of diffuse mediastinal diseases with their typical findings and major differentials.

First, pneumomediastinum that can be provoked by extra- or intra-thoracic triggers requires the knowledge of patient's history or recent occurrences. Absence of any usual etiological factor should raise suspicion of cocaine inhalation in young individuals.

Next, acute mediastinitis may be related to post-operative complications, esophageal perforation, or contiguous spread of odontogenic or retropharyngeal infections. The former diagnosis is not an easy task in the early stage, owing to the similarities of imaging findings with those of normal post-operative appearance during the first 2–3 weeks.

Finally, fibrosing mediastinitis that is linked to an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum with variable compromise of mediastinal structures, in particular vascular and airway ones. Differential diagnosis includes tumoral and inflammatory infiltrations of the mediastinum.

### Sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma [^116EARgD]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Learning points

Hilar and mediastianal lymphadenopathy are common in sarcoidosis and lymphoma, and there are rare patients in whom both of these diseases coexist, particularly when splenomegaly becomes a dominant feature.
Unexplained recurrent peripheral lymphadenopathy and worsening splenomegaly in patient with sarcoidosis must raise suspicion of concurrent lymphoproliferative disease.
In such patients splenectomy may be necessary to establish a diagnosis.
Precise diagnosis, including repeated lymph node biopsies, is essential in such case to avoid inappropriate treatment (eg, prednisone).

Committee conclusions

The committee weighed the observations that mediastinoscopy has a higher diagnostic yield than EBUS-guided lymph node biopsy (98% and 87%, respectively), but EBUS-guided lymph node biopsy is less invasive than mediastinoscopy. The committee recognized probable underestimation of the risk of mediastinoscopy given the bias toward reporting only severe complications, implying that less severe complications, like vocal cord damage and their associated costs and inconveniences, were not counted. In lieu of rigorous data directly comparing complication rates of mediastinoscopy to EBUS specifically among patients with suspected sarcoidosis, the committee considered a recent systemic review of 9 studies (960 cases) comparing complications of mediastinoscopy and EBUS among patients undergoing mediastinal staging of lung cancer. The systemic review found a statistically higher complication rate for mediastinoscopy. The committee also agreed that costs are typically lower for procedures such as EBUS that are performed in an endoscopy room compared with an operating room for mediastinoscopy, and that EBUS is better tolerated than mediastinoscopy because general anesthesia may be avoided, although the committee acknowledged that dissenting opinions exist. Finally, the committee noted the ease of adding transbronchial biopsy when lymphadenopathy is accompanied by radiographic findings of parenchymal disease, or endobronchial biopsy when mucosal abnormalities are noted during endoscopy, which further increase the yield of bronchoscopy with EBUS. The committee concluded that the advantages of EBUS-guided lymph node sampling for the 87% of patients in whom it is diagnostic outweigh the additional risks and burdens to the 13% of patients who require an additional sampling procedure.

The role of conventional blind transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was not specifically investigated. Prior studies directly comparing blind TBNA to EBUS-guided TBNA show the performance of the latter to be significantly better with much higher negative predictive value. Nonetheless, the committee believed that conventional TBNA is a low-risk procedure that is widely available and, therefore, is a reasonable alternative to EBUS when the latter is unavailable.

Recommendation

1 For patients with suspected sarcoidosis and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy for whom it has been determined that tissue sampling is necessary, we suggest EBUS-guided lymph node sampling, rather than mediastinoscopy, as the initial mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node sampling procedure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Research needs

The committee concluded that there is a need for research to determine whether the addition of CT or chest radiographic manifestations, or genomic or biochemical profiling, increases diagnostic yield beyond histologic assessment for tissue samples obtained via EBUS-guided sampling.

### Clinical implications of granulomatous inflammation detected by endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration in patients with suspected cancer recurrence in the mediastinum [^116a6n6j]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with a history of cancer, the onset of mediastinal adenopathy often heralds a recurrence of their malignancy. However, not all mediastinal adenopathy is due to cancer recurrence and lymph node sampling is warranted. Endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) allows real time assessment and biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes and therefore often obviates the need for mediastinoscopy. The utility of EBUS-TBNA in the mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer has been defined. More recently, the ability of EBUS-TBNA to identify granuloma in the work-up of patients with mediastinal adenopathy secondary to suspected sarcoidosis has been reported. Since the beginning of the last century, "local sarcoid reactions" and "sarcoid like lymphadenopathy" with pulmonary and mediastinal involvement have been described in patients with cancer. In this report, we describe a group of patients in whom EBUS-TBNA detected granulomatous inflammation in suspected cancer recurrence and examine the clinical implications of such a finding.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^1127REw2]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
Lymph node enlargement is common in rheumatological and autoimmune diseases, frequently associated with disease activity.
Lymphadenopathy observed in the rheumatology practice should always consider malignancy and infection as the primary causes.
Rare diseases such as IgG4-related disease and Castleman disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Multifocal nodular episcleritis and scleritis with undiagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111huxcw]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the case of a patient with undiagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented with coexistent unilateral nodular episcleritis and scleritis.

Design

Interventional case report and literature review

Methods

Review of clinical history, laboratory findings, histology of episcleral and cervical lymph node biopsies, and follow-up.

Results

A 20-year-old female presented with a 5-month history of redness and pain in her left eye, with associated symptoms of dyspnea, malaise, and fever. The patient was found to have multifocal nodular episcleritis and scleritis that was not responsive to topical steroids or systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment. Laboratory tests subsequently revealed evidence of systemic inflammation, and radiologic studies showed extensive mediastinal and cervical adenopathy. A cervical lymph node biopsy showed Reed-Sternberg cells and a chronic lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. Histopathologic analysis of an episcleral nodule revealed a necrotizing granuloma with vasculitis. Systemic chemotherapy was instituted for the Hodgkin's disease; this therapy abolished the nodular scleritis.

Conclusions

This case raises the possibility of concurrent undiagnosed systemic vasculitis with only an ocular manifestation with Hodgkin's lymphoma, either as a coincidence or as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Moreover, it emphasizes the important role of tissue biopsy in establishing diagnosis and directing treatment.

### The scar sign: a useful finding on FDG PET / CT to distinguish sarcoidosis from other causes of lymphadenopathy [^1165Qb6t]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Scar involvement is a rare but characteristic cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. The concurrent presence of FDG-avid lymphadenopathy and scar involvement (the "scar sign") is a useful finding on FDG PET/CT to suggest sarcoidosis, especially when biopsy specimens are difficult to obtain. A 46-year-old woman who presented with fever, cough, and weight loss was found to have mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography and CT scan. FDG PET/CT scan showed FDG-avid lower cervical, mediastinal, hilar, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was also increased FDG uptake along an old hysterectomy scar. Mediastinoscopy and nodal biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115723oJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Committee members concur that there is a pressing need for higher-quality evidence to guide clinical practice relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis, and to better define the natural history of disease progression in each organ system. A large body of related data has been published, but very few of these studies were properly designed to guide clinical practice. Nonetheless, this document establishes the current standards of care based on a rigorous and unbiased analysis of the available data, and provides direction for future investigations to further refine clinical practice to improve diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. Figure 3 provides an algorithm that incorporates the recommendations of these guidelines within the scope of clinical practice for the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis.

A 54-year-old asymptomatic man presented with an anterior mediastinal mass discovered on chest roentgenogram. Chest computed tomography revealed a noncalcified round mass in the mediastinum. A white solid mass, 5-cm in diameter, had arisen from the pericardial adipose tissue with multiple small nodular lesions mimicking mediastinal tumor with pleural dissemination. Postoperative pathologic examination confirmed a diagnosis of sclerosing mediastinitis. Details of the clinical and radiographic feature are presented.

### Treatment-induced sarcoidosis in a patient with metastatic clear cell ovarian cancer [^114mbbzA]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that commonly presents with lung or lymphatic system manifestations. Diagnosis is often delayed due to variable clinical presentation. This is a case of a patient with metastatic clear cell ovarian cancer who developed disease reoccurence after definitive treatment with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. She was treated with multiple lines of therapy, including investigational agents. During this time, she developed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hypercalcaemia. Due to suspicion that her presentation was not a manifestation of her malignancy, she underwent two lymph node biopsies revealing granulomatous disease. She was initiated on prednisone for management of sarcoidosis, which led to radiologic, laboratory and symptomatic improvement. Although the precipitating factor for this patient's sarcoidosis cannot be definitively determined, nivolumab is a possible culprit. This case highlights the importance of a broad differential diagnosis when a patient undergoing antineoplastic treatment develops mediastinal lymphadenopathy or hypercalcaemia.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^111NhhuE]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies indicated that clinical risk factors for lung cancer include older age, histories of smoking and COPD, and elevated tumor markers. In this study, patients with PLCs were older and more frequently exhibited COPD, along with higher levels of cytokeratin 19 and CEA, consistent with previous results. However, a history of smoking was not a predictor of PLCs, possibly because it was also a risk factor for granulomas. Additionally, this study identified diabetes as a risk factor for granulomas, which may be related to the fact that granulomas, often caused by TB and fungal infections, are more likely to develop in patients with immunocompromised conditions due to diabetes. Therefore, when differentiating granulomas and PLCs, it is essential to consider the patients' clinical data, particularly the presence of potential immunosuppressive conditions.

Regular SNs with lobulation were highly indicative of lung cancer, especially those with coarse margin, air bronchogram, spiculation, and pleural indentation. In this study, irregular SNs without lobulation were found to be relatively common in granulomas, which is similar to the previous study focused on comparing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. However, other CT morphological features were not reliable predictors for either granulomas or PLCs. Furthermore, this study found that it was not effective for mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in distinguishing PLCs from granulomas, inconsistent with previous studies on benign and malignant nodules. This may be because both inflammation caused by granuloma and lung cancer metastasis can lead to lymphadenopathy. Consequently, it is challenging to differentiate them based solely on the CT morphological features. Thiessen et al obtained similar results, they found that CT morphological features were insufficient to differentiate granulomas with necrosis from malignant tumors, requiring core needle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. However, the risk of false-negative results associated with needle biopsy necessitates caution. Therefore, integrating additional valuable CT features with biopsy validation is essential, particularly for those stable SNs during follow-up.

### A patient presenting with generalised lympadenopathy – sarcoidosis, lymphoma or tuberculosis? [^116TKSiL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis, lymphoma and tuberculosis can often present with similar clinical features - for example, lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, hypercalcaemia - making the establishment of the diagnosis difficult. The authors present a case of a 62-year-old woman with an established diagnosis of sarcoidosis affecting the lymph nodes, who subsequently developed high-grade T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the patient was also treated for active tuberculosis at the same time. This case highlights that these conditions can co-exist and that the occurrence of new and rapidly progressive symptoms in patients with an established diagnosis should alert clinicians to vigilantly search for another possible diagnosis.

### Noninfectious granulomatous diseases of the chest [^113qz4BS]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Granulomas are pathologically defined as focal aggregations of activated macrophages, Langerhans cells, and lymphocytes. Granulomas form in the lungs when the immune system barricades the substances it perceives as foreign but is unable to remove. Granulomas manifest with numerous imaging appearances in thoracic radiology, and their presence is a nonspecific finding. Granulomatous lung diseases comprise multiple entities with variable clinical manifestations and outcomes. Their imaging findings are rarely specific and can mimic malignancies, often triggering an extensive diagnostic workup. Radiologists must be familiar with the clinical manifestations and imaging findings of these entities to generate appropriate differential diagnoses. This review describes the imaging manifestations of various noninfectious, necrotizing, and nonnecrotizing granulomatous diseases that primarily affect the thorax. © RSNA, 2020.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112Libv5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Histopathology

Given that the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are often nonspecific, histological evaluation of tissue granulomas is often required to establish the diagnosis. Histological features that are typical of a sarcoidosis granuloma include the presence of well-formed, concentrically arranged layers of immune cells, most prominent being the central core of macrophage aggregates and multinucleated giant cells. An outer layer of loosely organized lymphocytes, mostly T cells, is often observed with a few interposed dendritic cells. In some cases, the granulomas are surrounded by isolated collections of B lymphocytes. Sarcoidosis granulomas are most often nonnecrotic; however, variants of sarcoidosis, particularly the nodular pulmonary sarcoidosis phenotype, can present with a mixture of necrotic and nonnecrotic granulomas.

The differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases is broad, as noted in the next section. Table 2 and Figure 1 provide histopathological features that are useful for discriminating sarcoidosis from other causes, although histopathologic features alone cannot distinguish sarcoidosis from other granulomatous diseases. Certain granulomatous diseases may have similar histological features, such as berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease).

Table 2.
Key Pathological Features of Sarcoidosis

(A) Typical sarcoidosis histology with well-formed granulomas comprised of macrophage aggregates (G) and featuring multinucleated giant cells (white arrows, inset), with minimal surrounding lymphocytic inflammation (L). (B) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis featuring smaller granulomas (G) with more extensive surrounding lymphocytic alveolitis (L). (C) A large acellular necrotizing granuloma (NG) caused by pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum infection.

Exclusion of alternative causes

To ensure diagnostic accuracy of sarcoidosis, the differential diagnosis must be considered and alternative diagnoses reliably excluded during the initial diagnostic evaluation or in presumed established sarcoidosis cases with atypical clinical features, such as those refractory to immune suppression treatment. Although tissue histopathology may reveal an alternative diagnosis (Figure 1), granulomas found in patients with sarcoidosis have no unique histologic features to differentiate them from all other granulomatous diseases. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis, therefore, requires a complete history and physical examination and, when indicated, additional testing to exclude other disorders, especially those that also produce granulomas. The differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis is typically categorized into granulomatous disorders of infectious and noninfectious causes (Table 3 provides representative examples of each). An alternative schema classifies these diagnoses according to the affected organ system(s) (Table 4).

### Surprising diagnosis: classical Hodgkin lymphoma presenting as an acute asthma attack [^1131FxrH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her early 20s with previously well-controlled intermittent asthma presented with sudden-onset dyspnoea and wheeze, initially treated as a life-threatening asthma exacerbation. Despite optimal medical therapy, her condition deteriorated, and imaging revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass causing tracheal compression. Biopsy confirmed nodular sclerosing classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This case highlights the importance of early imaging and maintaining a broad differential when patients do not respond to standard asthma therapy.

IgG-4 related disease

Fibrosing mediastinitis has been reported as an unusual mediastinal manifestation of IgG4-related disease (Fig. 11). The diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation for other disease manifestations, including Riedel's thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, or autoimmune pancreatitis, which may precede and/or suggest the diagnosis. Improvement with corticosteroid therapy has been described in this setting in contrast to numerous other forms of fibrosing mediastinitis.

Erdheim-Chester disease

In addition to IgG4 disease, some disorders, such as Erdheim-Chester disease, must be suspected in case of multisystemic involvement. This rare, non-inherited, non-Langerhans form of histiocytosis, commonly with a BRAF mutation, is characterized by xanthomatous infiltration of the involved tissues with foamy histiocytes surrounded by fibrosis, and appears with heterogeneous systemic manifestations. A common peri-aortic infiltration that extends to the pericardium, the right coronary sulci, and/or the myocardium of the right atrium with pleural involvement may point toward this rare entity. Furthermore, bone, renal, and retroperitoneal involvement (Fig. 12) have been observed. Cardiac-gated CT is required to detect coronary involvement.

Fig. 12
Erdheim-Chester disease. Typical pattern of Erdheim-Chester disease with infiltration of the right coronary artery sulcus (a) and the pericardium, well assessed on a sagittal reformation (b). In addition to the mediastinal/pericardial involvement encasing the right pulmonary artery, note the right paravertebral thickening on axial slices (a, c). Renal involvement with infiltration of the sinuses was also observed (d)

Differential diagnosis

The radiological differential diagnosis of diffuse fibrosing mediastinitis is extensive (Fig. 14) and includes lymphoma (Fig. 13), primary lung cancer, metastases, Castleman disease, and uncommonly, atypical sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Benign disorders, such as amyloidosis or lymphangiomatosis, may also diffusely infiltrate into the mediastinum (Fig. 15). The latter affects the lymphatic channels from the mediastinum to the pleura, with an associated thickening of the pulmonary peribronchovascular bundles and interlobular septae, reflecting the lymphatic distribution. Infectious disorders, such as actinomycosis, aspergillosis, zygomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, nocardiosis, mycobacterial infection, or syphilis, should also be excluded.

### Can computed tomography findings and radiomics analysis of mediastinal lymph nodes differentiate between sarcoidosis and lymphoma? [^1165DBgi]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) findings and radiomics analysis to differentiate mediastinal lymphadenopathies as sarcoidosis versus lymphoma.

Materials and Methods

94 patients with lymphoma and 97 patients with sarcoidosis, who had > 1cm mediastinal lymph node were included. Size, location of lymph nodes, and distribution of the largest lymph nodes in two groups were compared. A total of 636 lymphadenopathies in four different regions were segmented for radiomics. Lesion segmentation was semiautomatically performed with a dedicated commercial software package on chest CT images. 149 patients were grouped as a training cohort, while 42 patients who underwent CT in the oncology hospital were used for external validation. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was used to perform feature selection. Using selected features, the classification performance of various data mining methods in separating groups of sarcoidosis and lymphoma was investigated.

Results

Distribution and size of lymphadenopathies were significantly different in sarcoidosis and lymphoma groups (< 0.05). Radiomics and data mining methods showed excellent performance in differentiating lymph nodes of sarcoidosis and lymphoma according to both the largest lymphadenopathy and lymphadenopathies in four different mediastinal regions (AUC > 0,95).

Conclusions

Distribution and size of lymphadenopathies can help differential diagnosis in patients with sarcoidosis and lymphoma. CT radiomics analysis can discriminate the lymph nodes of sarcoidosis and lymphoma with great performance regardless of lymph node size and location and it can be used safely in the diagnosis of these diseases, which can sometimes be challenging to distinguish from each other.

### Technical aspects of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111JXBoi]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of sarcoidosis — role of EBUS-TBNA: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on the presence of a compatible clinical scenario, radiographic findings, and histologic confirmation of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and TBNA are commonly used bronchoscopic techniques for determining granulomas. EBUS-TBNA was initially introduced as a minimally invasive modality for lymph node staging in lung cancer, but its use has been expanded for the evaluation of patients with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Studies have illustrated the benefit of using EBUS-TBNA alone as well as in conjunction with other bronchoscopic techniques for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and although earlier studies were mainly retrospective case review analyses, several prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials are available on this topic.

### Mediastinal transthoracic needle and core lymph node biopsy: should it replace mediastinoscopy? [^11262Ufq]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Primary assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes (N2 or N3) for staging lung cancer by transthoracic needle with or without core biopsy. Mediastinoscopy only performed after FNA failed to yield a diagnosis.

Design and Settings

A retrospective study in a university setting.

Patients

Eighty-nine patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (> 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter) by CT.

Methods

Mediastinal transthoracic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with or without core biopsy was performed prior to mediastinoscopy in 89 patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (lymph node > 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter) or masses by CT.

Results

Mediastinal transthoracic FNA was used alone in 39 of 89 patients, or with core biopsy in 50 of 89 patients. Mediastinal transthoracic FNA with or without core biopsy was diagnostic in 69 of 89 patients (77.5%) for cancer cell type, sarcoidosis, or caseating granulomas with or without tuberculosis. Transthoracic FNA with or without core biopsy of nodal stations (total, 94 biopsies) judged readily accessible by mediastinoscopy (n = 59) included paratracheal (n = 56) and highest mediastinal (n = 3); those more difficult (n = 26) included subcarinal (n = 20) and aorticopulmonary window (n = 6); and those impossible (n = 9) included paraesophageal and pulmonary ligament (n = 6), parasternal (n = 2), and para-aortic (n = 1). Innovative lung protective techniques for CT-guided biopsy access windows included "iatrogenic-controlled pneumothorax" (n = 10) or saline solution injection creating a "salinoma" (n = 11). Pneumothorax was detected in only 10% with a "protective" technique but 60% when traversing lung parenchyma. Transthoracic FNA with or without core biopsy failed to yield a diagnosis in 20 of 89 patients (22.5%); all then underwent mediastinoscopy, with 11 of 20 procedures (55%) diagnostic for cancer, and 9 of 20 procedures diagnostic of benign diagnosis or no cancer.

Conclusion

Transthoracic FNA with or without core biopsy accesses virtually all mediastinal nodal stations is diagnostic in 78% of cases with mediastinal adenopathy or masses, and should precede mediastinoscopy in the staging of lung cancer or workup of mediastinal masses.

### Sarcoidlike reaction of neoplasia causing hypermetabolic thoracic adenopathy in setting of extrathoracic malignancy: report of two cases and a review of the differential diagnostic considerations [^115yXyXU]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Low credibility.

The development of noncaseating granulomas in a patient with underlying malignancy and no symptoms or signs suggestive of systemic sarcoid is often referred to as a sarcoidlike reaction and is estimated to occur in a small but significant portion of cancer patients. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, but the entity is hypothesized to be an immune phenomenon representing a host defense mechanism against the spread of tumor cells. Sarcoidlike reactions can occur at any time from the time of diagnosis to several years afterward and may occur in lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor, in the tumor itself, and even in nonregional tissues. Like sarcoid, sarcoidlike reactions of neoplasia can demonstrate hypermetabolic lymph nodes on (18)F-FDG PET imaging and thus be readily confused with metastatic disease. We describe 2 cases of a sarcoidlike reaction of neoplasia presenting as hypermetabolic thoracic lymph nodes on (18)F-FDG PET/CT obtained for follow-up of extrathoracic malignancies: one a 73-y-old woman with a history of stage III head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and the other a 34-y-old woman with recurrent giant cell tumor of the sacrum. In both instances, the differential diagnosis for the finding of hypermetabolic thoracic lymph nodes included the possibility of a sarcoidlike reaction, though tissue sampling was pursued to exclude the more worrisome presence of metastatic disease or, less likely, a new primary malignancy. We review the topic of sarcoidlike reactions of neoplasia as well as the analytic approach to hypermetabolic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes encountered on (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

### An unusual cause for a relatively common radiographic abnormality [^114vUzG9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old Indian woman presented to the respiratory clinic with chest pains, long-standing swallowing difficulties and a chest radiograph, which was reported as showing a shadow in the right paratracheal region. A CT scan was obtained and was reported as demonstrating a right-sided paratracheal lymph node and varicosities adjacent to the inferior vena cava. Histology from an endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a heavily blood-stained sample but showed no evidence of granulomas or malignancy. Subsequently, the images were reviewed, with the conclusion that they were actually of an engorged azygos vein compressing the oesophagus. MRI confirmed the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the presence of a prominent hemiazygos vein compressing the oesophagus. This case highlights the importance of including anatomical abnormalities in the differential diagnosis and reassessing patients when the history and investigations do not correlate.

### Serum metabolic disparity between patients with lymph node tuberculosis and patients with sarcoidosis: towards differential diagnosis [^11432f1m]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis (SAR) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by multisystem involvement; however, its etiology is still elusive. It can involve almost any organ system of the human body, but lung, skin and eye involvement are relatively common. A combination of compatible clinical presentation, demonstration of noncaseating granulomas in tissue or body fluids and exclusion of known etiologies of granulomatous inflammation is needed for establishing a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from no symptoms to severe respiratory insufficiency, cardiac death, neurological disease, and blindness. A challenging aspect in the management of sarcoidosis is to differentiate it from tuberculosis (TB), especially in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis infection. Like SAR, TB is also a granulomatous disease, and the most common sites of granulomatous inflammation in both SAR and TB are the lymph nodes. Therefore, these diseases not only share overlapping clinical, radiological, and histopathological features but can also present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, making clinical differentiation difficult. Lymphadenopathy with or without lung infiltrates is also common in both SARs and TBs, and furthermore, there are no definitive radiological imaging features that can conclusively differentiate SARs from LNTBs.

TB is a common infectious disease worldwide caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the cause of sarcoidosis is unknown; however, TB is classified as an autoimmune disorder owing to the abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cells resulting in the formation of granulomas in the affected organ system. Often, tuberculosis granulomas exhibit a foamy phenotype owing to lipid-laden foamy macrophages and subsequently form caseum (a cheese-like structure) due to macrophage necrosis. On the other hand, sarcoidal granulomas are sterile without caseum and form the basis for the suggestive diagnosis of SAR in tertiary-care settings. These distinctive features of sarcoidal granulomas (i.e. noncaseous granulomas and negative pathogenic demonstrations) are confirmed through histopathological and microbial analysis of biopsy samples obtained from granulomatous tissue, which is an invasive and very painful procedure that is difficult to perform in general primary hospitals and secondary healthcare centers. Therefore, there is immense clinical interest in investigating noninvasive biomarkers for differentiating SAR from lymph node TB (LNTB). The identification of individuals with active TB infection (ATBI) is also a priority set under the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) both (a) to control TB or its progression through starting appropriate clinical/public health interventions and (b) to reduce further spread in the community.

Immune-inflammatory diseases

Sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology and is usually seen in patients aged 20–40 years. The disease can affect any system or organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, joints, bones, salivary glands, central nervous system, and muscles. Lung involvement is the most common presentation, with a rate of more than 90%. Although the clinical presentation varies according to the involved organ, patients with pulmonary involvement usually present with cough and dyspnea. Sarcoidosis is distinguished by the presence of non-infectious, non-caseating granulomas, primarily consisting of macrophages that transform into epithelioid cells, which then merge to create multinucleated giant cells.

The common radiological findings are hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with or without associated lung parenchymal involvement (Fig. 4). Parenchymal involvement is usually seen as micronodules with perilymphatic distribution in the early stage of the disease, and parenchymal fibrosis in the late stages. However, micronodules may coalesce over time and form macronodules.

Fig. 4
Sarcoidosis. A 45-year-old female patient with a complaint of cough was diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Axial chest CT image (mediastinal window) (a) shows bilateral hilar (arrows) lymphadenopathies. Posteroanterior chest radiograph (b) shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (arrows). Axial (c – f) and coronal (g) CT images show bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules mostly observed in the upper lobes peripherally or centrally (arrows). Fewer nodules are observed in the lower lobes of both lungs. Photomicrograph shows non-necrotizing, well-formed granulomas in the lung parenchyma (H&E × 100) (h)

Multiple nodular sarcoidosis, which is a rare presentation of pulmonary sarcoidosis with incidence rates varying from 2.4 to 4%, usually manifests as multiple, bilateral pulmonary nodules or masses mostly in the perihilar and peripheral region of the lungs (Fig. 4). Additionally, the predominance of nodules in the upper and middle lobes can aid in differential diagnosis. The radiological findings of nodular sarcoidosis are not specific and resemble those of other nodular pulmonary diseases.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^115xjhsz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer — preoperative pathology and specimen assessment emphasizes that all specimens should be assessed morphologically, including routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology; cytology may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas; ideally, a diagnosis of NSCLC can be done using H&E findings, clinical findings, imaging studies, and the patient's history; if necessary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) should be used to distinguish adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, and primary pleural mesothelioma; and typically, treatment is not recommended until the patient has been diagnosed with NSCLC. Preoperative evaluations include examination of bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, sputum, FNA biopsy, core needle biopsy, endobronchial biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy; minimally invasive techniques can be used to obtain specimens in patients with advanced unresectable NSCLC, although diagnosis may be more difficult when using small biopsies and cytology; when available, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) may be used to ensure that transbronchial needle aspirates or EBUS specimens are adequate for diagnosis and biomarker testing; the mediastinal lymph nodes are systematically sampled to determine the staging and therapeutic options; other lung diseases need to be ruled out, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and coccidioidomycosis; and lobectomy or pneumonectomy specimens are evaluated intraoperatively to determine surgical resection margin status, diagnose incidental nodules discovered at the time of surgery, or evaluate regional lymph nodes.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, spleen, bone, and glandular tissue. The diagnosis is made when characteristic histologic findings are demonstrated and other granulomatous processes are excluded. It can be an acute or chronic debilitating disease, but in patients with acute disease the process can be self-limited. Multiple therapeutic options have been described both for the cutaneous and systemic lesions of sarcoidosis. Steroids, however, remain the cornerstone of therapy.

### Clinical implications of granulomatous inflammation detected by endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration in patients with suspected cancer recurrence in the mediastinum [^1125qV3G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Consistent with the recently published study of the utility of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, we have confirmed that EBUS-TBNA can identify granulomatous disease in the mediastinum. However, in an academic cancer center, we identified a sub-group of patients with a prior history of cancer with new mediastinal lymphadenopathy in whom EBUS-TBNA detected granulomatous inflammation. These patients account for at least 5% of all EBUS-TBNA performed at our institution. This may be an underestimation as we only perform cytological examination of aspirated material routinely, without histologic cores that are difficult to obtain with the currently available 22 gauge needles. Furthermore, the false negative rate for granulomatous inflammation was not investigated with mediastinoscopy in our series.

Despite the fact that it has been recognized for over a century that an association between granulomatous inflammation and cancer exists, the cause of this relationship is unknown. Many hypotheses exist such as immunological dysfunction related to cancer and sarcoidosis, a side effect of cancer therapy (although the phenomenon has been described in cancer patients treated with surgery alone), and "antigenic shedding" from the tumor leading to granuloma formation. In fact, there is no agreement on what to name the phenomenon of mediastinal and hilar adenopathy secondary to granulomatous inflammation in treated cancer patients (sarcoid like reaction, sarcoid like lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and mediastinal "sarcoidosis" or simply sarcoidosis). A detailed analysis of these hypotheses and arguments is beyond the limits of this report.

Prior reports have highlighted this phenomenon in many different cancer types, although there seems to be an over representation of patients with testicular germ cell tumors. Characteristics of the patients reported in this manuscript such as a lack of prior history of granulomatous disease or evidence of mediastinal adenopathy at the time of cancer diagnosis, no ethnic association, varying time between cancer and sarcoid diagnosis, adenopathy distant to the primary site and varying course and response to treatment are in keeping with prior reports and differentiate this phenomenon from local sarcoid reactions in draining lymph nodes which occur at the time of primary cancer diagnosis. Of note, two of the patients we report were treated with imatinib and two with docetaxel which both have been associated with interstitial lung disease, although neither with granulomatous inflammation.

### The pathology of sarcoidosis [^111mvCCf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease characterized by a nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammatory process that can progress through various stages of activity. The distinctive histology of sarcoidosis is often associated with various morphologic findings in the lung and other organs. The rare variants, necrotizing sarcoidal granulomas and nodular sarcoidosis, share some of the histologic features of typical sarcoidosis, but may have different clinical and pathologic manifestations. The clinician and pathologist should be aware of the diverse pathologic appearances of sarcoidosis.

### Approaching the patient with an anterior mediastinal mass: a guide for clinicians [^11167cjK]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Anterior mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, include a wide variety of entities, and often pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. In this article, available data is assembled in a clinically oriented manner to develop a structured approach to evaluation of these patients. Attention to age and gender, combined with identification of certain radiographic and clinical characteristics, allows a presumptive diagnosis to be established in most patients. This structure efficiently guides what additional workup is needed.

### Unusual sclerosing haemangiomas and sclerosing haemangioma-like lesions, and the value of TTF-1 in making the diagnosis [^112msf5t]. Histopathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

Sclerosing haemangiomas typically comprise a mixture of four architectural patterns (papillary, sclerotic, solid and haemorrhagic) and two cell types, eosinophilic cuboidal epithelial lining cells and sheets of rounded cells with either eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm. In most instances, recognition of these architectural and cytological features provides sufficient evidence for diagnosis. This study presents and discusses the histogenesis of four cases where difficulties in diagnosis were encountered, and reports the value of the antibody TTF-1 in making the diagnosis.

Methods and Results

Four cases with focal areas reminiscent of sclerosing haemangioma were reviewed and immunostained with an antibody panel including antibodies to TTF-1 and surfactant apoprotein A. Of these, one case was classified as sclerosing haemangioma combined with typical carcinoid, in which there was a mediastinal lymph node metastasis solely comprising the solid component of sclerosing haemangioma. The second was classified as an alveolar adenoma with sclerosing haemangioma-like areas. In the remaining two cases, diagnosis was confounded by presentation with predominantly cystic masses, the largest 70 mm in diameter. Immunohistochemically, TTF-1 was of greater value than surfactant apoprotein, in particular in identifying the solid component of sclerosing haemangioma when this was solely present.

Conclusion

Sclerosing haemangiomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic pulmonary masses. They may also present histologically as combined tumours and metastasize to mediastinal nodes, indicating an, albeit low, malignant potential. TTF-1 is a valuable antibody in identifying the presence of a sclerosing haemangioma when typical features are absent.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^112TNWxU]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

An uncommon but important complication of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is fibrosing mediastinitis. It is a benign, progressive fibroinflammatory process that manifests as an infiltrating mediastinal soft tissue mass usually located within the middle mediastinum. It can result in the distortion and compression of major vessels and central airways and is a common cause of superior vena cava syndrome. On FDG-PET/CT, fibrosing mediastinitis can show varying levels of FDG uptake, demonstrating increased uptake in the more acute, active inflammatory stage (Fig. 3a–c) and little to no uptake in more chronic disease. This suggests a possible role for FDG-PET/CT in assessing disease activity, which can inform treatment decisions.

### Multimodality imaging of focal and diffuse fibrosing mediastinitis [^115J2Ew6]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare benign but potentially life-threatening process that occurs because of proliferation of fibrotic tissue in the mediastinum. The focal subtype is more common and typically is associated with an abnormal immunologic response to Histoplasma capsulatum infection. Affected patients are typically young at presentation, but a wide age range has been reported, without a predilection for either sex. The diffuse form may be idiopathic or associated with autoimmunity, usually affects middle-aged and/or elderly patients, and is more common in men. For both subtypes, patients present with signs and symptoms related to obstruction or compression of vital mediastinal structures. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are cough, dyspnea, recurrent pneumonia, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Patients with the diffuse subtype may have additional extrathoracic symptoms depending on the other organ systems involved. Because symptom severity is variable, treatment should be individualized with therapies tailored to alleviate compression of the affected mediastinal structures. Characteristic imaging features of fibrosing mediastinitis include infiltrative mediastinal soft tissue (with or without calcification) with compression or obstruction of mediastinal vascular structures and/or the aerodigestive tract. When identified in the appropriate clinical setting, these characteristic features allow the radiologist to suggest the diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis. Careful assessment is crucial at initial and follow-up imaging for exclusion of underlying malignancy, assessment of disease progression, identification of complications, and evaluation of treatment response.

### Imaging features and differential diagnoses of non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases [^117Swag7]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and technical approach

Diffuse mediastinal diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of entities characterized by various degrees of severity. Although these diseases are well-known disorders, diagnosis is not uncommonly delayed due to nonspecific and sometimes faint clinical presentations and symptoms, even in the potentially more serious conditions. Pneumomediastinum should be suspected in case of chest pain, dyspnea, and subcutaneous emphysema. However, acute mediastinitis commonly presents with fever, pleuritic or retrosternal chest pain, and inflammatory syndrome. In fibrosing mediastinitis, the main clinical symptoms include dyspnea and superior vena cava syndrome due to external vascular stricture and airway stenosis. Careful clinical evaluation and radiological correlation is of the utmost importance when approaching diffuse mediastinal pathologies in order to differentiate neoplastic mediastinal infiltration.

Although mediastinal involvement may be suspected on chest radiographs, the signs may be easily missed; hence CT, and, in selected patients, MRI, should be conducted to evaluate the mediastinal compartments. High-resolution imaging is required to provide a detailed assessment of the mediastinal compartment and its complex anatomy, as well as associated anomalies. CT, with a water-soluble contrast agent following a non-contrast acquisition, may demonstrate the esophageal rupture in case of pneumomediastinum, or stenosis in case of chronic mediastinitis. Next, an acquisition with IV contrast may be beneficial in acute and chronic mediastinitis — simultaneous injection of contrast material via brachial veins on both sides may be considered — because this can also depict the regional environment, as well as any additional findings. 18F-FDG PET/CT and diffusion/dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI may be helpful in assessing disease extent and guiding tissue sampling. Fluoroscopy may be part of the diagnosis if an esophageal rupture is suspected and/or in case of vascular compromise as part of the therapeutic procedure.

Specific associated injuries or lesions need to be systematically determined, based on the imaging findings. Various non-neoplastic conditions will be discussed in the following sections.

### Sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma [^115htjHr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Coexistence of sarcoidosis and lymphoma has been reported previously. In fact, patients with sarcoidosis are up to 11 times more likely to develop lymphoma. However, our case is unique in several respects.

As far as the sarcoidosis is concerned, there were a number of unusual features. First, her chest examination showed fine crackles, which is distinctly unusual in sarcoidosis. Second, distribution of lymphadenopathy and parenchymal abnormalities on the imaging were not typical for sarcoidosis. Third, despite the fact that the diagnostic yield of lymph node biopsies, particularly when the lymph nodes are pathologically enlarged, is over 80% — none of this patient's lymph nodes (axillary and mediastinal) showed granulomatous inflammation; in fact none of the other multiple organ biopsies, except the lung and spleen, showed classic granulomas.

There are also several unusual aspects concerning the lymphoma. First, it was very difficult to establish the diagnosis, despite repeated biopsies of multiple anatomical sites; it was only the splenectomy which allowed us to arrive at a diagnosis that would best explain the clinical picture. Second, the finding of plasmacytosis with lambda restriction in the bone marrow in the setting of elevated monoclonal serum free light chains simulated a plasma cell neoplasm, but the perisplenic lymph nodes showed features typical of marginal zone lymphoma with marked plasmacytic differentiation, suggesting that the marrow findings reflect involvement by the same process. Patients with sarcoidosis–lymphoma syndrome can create a challenging diagnostic dilemma. Granulomatous inflammation alone is not diagnostic of sarcoidosis and may occur in malignancies and infections, similar to our patient. In retrospect, however, there were several features which are common in sarcoidosis but not in lymphoma, such as development of Bell's palsy and concomitant elevation in serum calcium and serum ACE levels.

### Validity and reliability of transbronchial needle aspiration for diagnosing mediastinal adenopathies [^112T3cGA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Data interpretation

All samples with high lymphoid cellularity (at least 30%) suggesting a lymph node puncture or the existence of many neoplastic cells or cytological/histological findings that allowed for a specific diagnosis ("diagnostic samples") were considered "adequate samples". Samples with atypias or dubious, mucousy, bloody, or tracheobronchial wall cellularity were considered "non-adequate".

In all patients with TBNA performed in more than one lymph node station, the best diagnosis or the most adequate, if there was disagreement, was selected. Every patient was considered as an analysis unit.

All diagnostic samples, those with abundant lymphoid cellularity confirmed by a surgical technique, and those with benign pathology that did not change or disappeared after six months were considered true positives (TP). TPs were not further confirmed by a surgical technique due to the very high specificity of TBNA; false positives (FP) are extremely infrequent. Cases yielding only a very high lymphoid cellularity in patients with specific pathologies such as carcinomas, lymphomas, tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis, and whose surgical biopsies produced results similar to those of TBNA were considered true negatives (TN). The samples with lymphoid cellularity not confirmed by surgical techniques or follow-up and all patients with non-adequate TBNAs were considered false negatives (FNs).

The diagnosis of carcinoma or lymphoma was made according to standard criteria. Sarcoidosis was diagnosed when sarcoid granulomas were found and other diseases with similar clinical or radiologic findings could be reasonably excluded. Tuberculosis was diagnosed when the cytohistologic samples showed necrotizing granulomas with or without Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolation and the patient had a good response to antituberculosis treatment. Anthracotic or reactive adenopathies were diagnosed according to clinical criteria, occupational exposure, cytohistologic results (numerous benign lymphocytes and resolution of patient process or few lymphocytes plus numerous anthracotic pigment-laden macrophages), and clinical-radiologic follow-up (stabilization or disappearance of the nodes), and were considered non-specific pathologies.

### A surprising cause of acute right upper quadrant pain [^116uf6Ki]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 42 year-old African-American woman was admitted for severe acute right upper quadrant pain. Her liver function tests showed a cholestatic pattern of hepatitis. She had no known history of liver disease or sarcoidosis. Imaging of her liver and biliary tree did not reveal any apparent cause for her right upper quadrant pain. A liver biopsy was performed which showed granulomatous disease. This prompted a CT chest that showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the mediastinal lymphnode revealed non-caseating granulomas. Despite having no pulmonary symptoms or history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, she was diagnosed with systemic pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was treated with corticosteroids and had complete resolution of symptoms over the next several weeks.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^1176GXbm]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The wide application of computerized tomography (CT) in clinical practice has resulted in a significant increase in the detection of pulmonary nodules. Detected nodules are mainly classified as solid nodules (SNs) and sub-solid nodules (SSNs) based on their density difference. Currently, there have been extensive studies on the radiological identification of SSNs, while the differentiation of SNs remains a significant challenge due to their diverse etiology and complex CT characteristics. Most SNs are benign, and do not require immediate surgical intervention. In contrast, malignant ones are often associated with higher malignant potential and poorer prognosis than SSNs. Thus, accurate diagnosis of SNs is helpful for selecting appropriate treatment options for patients.

Peripheral lung cancers (PLCs) represent the most common malignant SNs, whereas granulomas are a relatively common type of benign SN. A previous study indicated that the CT features between necrotizing granulomas and lung cancers are indistinguishable, and tissue diagnosis is necessary. Furthermore, both granulomas and PLCs were frequently associated with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Thus, granulomas are often misdiagnosed as PLCs due to their similarities. Although calcification and satellite lesions are typical indicators in tuberculous granulomas, and halo signs are relatively specific in fungal granulomas, there are still a considerable number of granulomas lacking these typical CT features.

Given that atypical granulomas may be more difficult to distinguish from PLCs, it is essential to further differentiate them to guide clinical treatment effectively. However, specific studies focusing on this aspect have not yet been conducted. This study aimed to explore the clinical and CT indicators that can help differentiate between these two entities.

### Mediastinal rosai-dorfman disease with KRAS mutation case report and literature review [^117RyX7f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and literature review

RDD is a rare histiocytosis, previously categorized as a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, in the latest classification by the Histoplasmosis Society, cutaneous RDD is now designated within the histiocytosis group C, while other forms of RDD are categorized under the R group of histiocytosis.

The prevalence of RDD is notably low, estimated at 1:200,000. Approximately 43% of patients manifest extra-nodal lesions, and intrathoracic involvement is observed in merely about 2% of patients. Specifically, mediastinal RDD accounts for a strikingly minimal proportion, constituting only 0.5% or less of all mediastinal space-occupying lesion. Employing the PubMed database and utilizing the search formula "((thoracic) OR (mediastinal)) AND ((Rosai-Dorfman disease) OR (Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy))", we conducted a comprehensive search without restricting the time frame. This yielded 142 documents, and subsequent scrutiny in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Evaluation and Meta-Analysis) guidelines revealed a total of 23 case reports, documenting 23 patients diagnosed with mediastinal RDD (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of findings in mediastinal Rosai–Dorfman Disease patient

CT/MRI plain images of RDD-afflicted patients typically reveal well-defined, irregularly shaped lesions characterized by uniform densities/signals and significantly progressive enhancements on multi-contrast enhancement imaging. All included patients underwent lung CT or enhanced lung CT before biopsy, yielding varying imaging descriptions. Importantly, none received a pre-biopsy RDD diagnosis, and clinicians primarily considered differential diagnoses such as lymphoma, benign and malignant thymic tumors, pulmonary artery embolism, or noninfectious inflammatory disease. This underscores the challenge in leveraging lung CT results for definitive diagnoses, emphasizing their role more in disease screening and guiding the surgical approaches. PET-CT may offer improved insights into RDD indications. In a study by Jia et al. a patient with anterior mediastinal RDD exhibited abnormally high FDG uptake (SUVmax 8.96) on PET/CT, surpassing the average metabolic activity of thymic hyperplasia (SUVmax 1.1), thymoma (SUVmax 2.3) and thymic carcinoma (SUVmax 7.0). Notably, two reports by Agarwal et al. and Furia et al. recorded even higher SUVmax values at 34.0 and 35.0, indicating a potential reference value for PET-CT in RDD diagnosis.

### Approaching the patient with an anterior mediastinal mass: a guide for radiologists [^115tdM3K]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, yet include a large variety of entities. Some tumors can be diagnosed with confidence based on imaging alone; others when a typical appearance is combined with the right clinical presentation. A structured approach for radiologists is presented to facilitate evaluation of patients with anterior mediastinal tumors. The approach focuses first on the more common tumors and on imaging features that strongly suggest a particular diagnosis. Discussion with the clinician can be very helpful in formulating a presumptive diagnosis. This article also discusses that confirmatory imaging or biopsy tests are most beneficial in particular situations.

### A case with multiple nodules and mucosal oedema of the trachea and both bronchi induced by IgG4-related disease [^116AgU2u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The major differential clinical diagnoses of IgG4-RD are multicentric Castleman's disease, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (especially granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis), sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and Rosai-Dorfman disease. The diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RLD are presented in Table 1. Therefore, the elevation of serum IgG4 is not considered specific enough.

The present case is considered rare due to the presence of multiple nodules and mucosal edema of the central airway, and the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, ground-glass nodules, and masses in the lungs. Therefore, it is classified as dissimilar to the bronchovascular type. Therefore, other differential diagnoses, such as amyloidosis, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and adenoid cystic carcinoma should be considered. Thus, to establish a pathological diagnosis, it is crucial to perform a transbronchial biopsy, aiming to obtain a larger specimen size. We can obtain a larger specimen size using a cryoprobe compared to standard forceps, and a longer freezing time is associated with a larger specimen size. In this case, the pathological findings satisfied the definitive diagnosis criteria described above by endobronchial cryobiopsy. Therefore, we believe that performing endobronchial cryobiopsy is suitable for obtaining large specimens and samples in cases that are too solid to perform a standard biopsy. If there are not enough devices for cryobiopsy, we consider it another option to perform rigid forceps biopsies during rigid bronchoscopy.

In conclusion, the presence of multiple nodules and mucosal oedema around the trachea and central bronchi is a rare occurrence in IgG4-RD. Therefore, in the differential diagnosis of IgG4-RD, it is crucial to consider not only benign diseases but also malignant tumours. It is important to perform transbronchial biopsy to obtain sufficient tissue samples for a definitive diagnosis, and thus, cryobiopsy may be a preferable method for this purpose.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for IgG4 related lung disease

Definite diagnosis satisfies 1 + 2 + 3a or 1 + 2 + 3b + 4, probable diagnosis satisfies 1 + 2 + 4 or 1 + 2 + 3b + reference findings, and possible diagnosis satisfies 1 + 2 + 3b

### Idiopathic hyalinizing fibrosclerosis: a systemic steroid-resistant condition distinct from IgG4-related disease [^112EPQvh]. Human Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the concept of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) was proposed, that diagnosis has been considered in idiopathic fibroinflammatory diseases in various organs, particularly in cases with multi-organ involvement. We have recently encountered three cases of fibrosing disease of uncertain etiology with shared microscopic appearances. Case 1 (56-year-old man) had an irregular mass at the base of mesentery. Case 2 (29-year-old woman) presented with obstructive jaundice due to an ill-defined mass at the hepatic hilum and two lung nodules. Case 3 (53-year-old man) had multiple solid nodules in the mediastinum, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and mesentery; he also had diffuse irregular narrowing of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts in keeping with sclerosing cholangitis. Serum IgG4 concentrations were not elevated. Biopsies from the nodular lesions showed extensive hyalinizing fibrosis with an only focal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Thick collagenous bundles are arranged in an irregular or partly whorl pattern. Typical storiform fibrosis or obliterative phlebitis was not observed. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells was < 10 cells/high-power field; the ratio of IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cells was < 30%. After the histological diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis, pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma, and mediastinal fibrosis was made, they were treated with a trial of steroids, but none showed a significant response. In conclusion, a hyalinizing fibrotic condition can occur at various anatomical sites. They have shared microscopic findings, and are steroid-resistant. Although the clinical presentation may mimic IgG4-RD, the two conditions are likely distinct. We would propose a diagnostic term of 'idiopathic hyalinizing fibrosclerosis' for this under-recognized, rare, systemic condition.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting IgG4-RD, being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limbs oedema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized and the most commonly involved lymph node stations are mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical and inguinal. Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts. First, enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features. Second, lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease. Third, lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after diagnosis of extranodal disease. Fourth, generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears. Recently, IgG4-RD has been arrayed into four clinical phenotypes, based on the observation of patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are: (group 1) pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients), (group 2) retroperitoneum and aorta (24%), (group 3) head and neck–limited (24%) and (group 4) Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement (22%). Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of frequency (second most common organ involved after submandibular gland). On the other hand, group 1 features the lowest frequency with 15%, while group 2 and 3 display lymphadenopathy in roughly 25% of cases. At the microscopic level, lymph nodes can express five types of histologic pattern, all characterized by increased accumulation of IgG4+ plasma cells and by a IgG4/IgG ratio > 40% at immunohistochemistry. Pattern 1 is highly reminiscent of the plasmacytic histopathological subtype of MCD and is characterized by intact nodal architecture with hyperplastic follicles as well as follicles with some degree of germinal centre regression and possible penetration by venules. The interfollicular space displays increased high endothelial venules and abundant plasma cells. Pattern 2 shows a typical reactive follicular hyperplasia, encountered in other autoimmune diseases such as SLE and RA. Pattern 3 is characterized by normal or variably regressed follicles with marked expansion of the interfollicular space. This area is filled by prominent high endothelial venules, immunoblasts, small lymphocytes plasma cells and eosinophils. Pattern 4 is notable for the presence of 'transformed' germinal centres, two to four times larger than those of background follicles, which become ameboid or stellate shaped. Their follicles display a thickened mantle zone with inward protrusions into germinal centres. Pattern 5, known as 'inflammatory pseudotumor-like', is the least common and is characterized by replacement of the nodal parenchyma by sclero-hyaline tissue. Collagen fibers in this context may organize into a storiform pattern similar to that observed in other organ involved by IgG4-RD. Importantly, histological patterns may not be fully discriminating and specimens may contain more than one pattern at a time (Fig. 1).

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^113iRCB3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Histological evaluation

In pursuit of a diagnosis, the patient underwent multiple biopsies to assess the nature of her liver and bone lesions.
CT-guided liver biopsy (of lesions adjacent to the right main portal vein as well as the dome) (figure 4A–E) Of note, there was evidence of coalescing non-caseating granulomata, consistent with granulomatous inflammation. Acid-fast and fungal stains were negative. Unfortunately, no tissue cores were sent for cultures and the patient declined repeat biopsies for this purpose.
Bone biopsy of T12 vertebra No evidence of granulomas or malignancy were found. Bone tissue was sent for mycobacterial, fungal and bacterial stains and cultures, all of which returned negative.
Bone marrow evaluation Differentials including that of a haematological malignancy were considered and as such bone marrow evaluation was performed and showed no morphological evidence of abnormal cellular infiltrate in the marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy. Cytogenetics showed normal karyotype and there was no flow cytometric evidence of abnormal lymphoid infiltrate.

Cardiac evaluation

Transthoracic echocardiography and 12-lead ECG were normal. No cardiac MRI was planned.

Others

By the time the patient was referred to the rheumatology team, she declined further invasive diagnostic tests as she had by then undergone the above procedures. We had offered her the following:
Cervical/supraclavicular lymph node biopsy and endoscopic evaluation of her gastrointestinal tract A surgical consult was sought to facilitate the biopsy, however as the cervical lymph nodes were deemed to be prominent, but not significantly enlarged both the medical team and patient were advised to monitor the lymphadenopathy first as surgical risk was deemed to outweigh any benefit and limited information yield at present. The patient also declined any endoscopic evaluation as she had no other gastrointestinal symptoms aside from her right upper quadrant pain.
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and possibly endobronchial ultrasound guided lymph node biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes (for histology and cultures).

### Imaging in mediastinitis: a systematic review based on aetiology [^117GTkBz]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Mediastinitis refers to inflammation of the tissues located in the middle chest cavity. It can be secondary to infectious or non-infectious causes and depending on the aetiology may be acute or chronic. The majority of cases of acute mediastinitis are secondary to oesophageal perforation and open chest surgery. Less common causes include tracheal, bronchial perforation or direct extension of infection from adjacent tissues. Chronic or slowly developing mediastinitis mostly arise from tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, other fungal infections, cancer, or sarcoidosis. In a minority of cases the aetiology is lymphatic obstruction or an autoimmune disease. Radiological imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and therapeutic approach to mediastinitis. Generally, the initial radiological work-up includes radiographic studies either with or without contrast material. However, conventional chest radiography may be misleading in the diagnosis of mediastinitis. Cross-sectional imaging techniques are generally required for diagnosis and evaluation of the site and extent of mediastinal involvement. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may also guide the choice of the optimal therapeutic approach.

### Sarcoidosis as a systemic disease [^113sLnyc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease, where for the abnormal localized collections of chronic inflammatory cells, the granuloma is cardinal, which may result in the formation of nodule(s) in the tissue of any organ of the body, with lungs and lymph nodes involvement being the most common. The granulomas are nonnecrotizing. The disease may either be asymptomatic or chronic. Its onset is gradual and may improve or clear up spontaneously. Clinical features of specific and nonspecific cutaneous lesions are described, emphasizing their role as a prelude to its systemic manifestations, afflicting respiratory, liver, spleen, musculoskeletal, ocular, cardiac, and neurologic systems. The salient briefs of diagnostic procedures are outlined, in addition to historical background and etiopathogenesis. Several currently available treatment modalities are outlined for instant reference.

### Sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma [^1167cGyq]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis and lymphoma are generally thought of as being two mutually exclusive diseases that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with hilar/mediastianal lymphadenopathy. However, there are rare patients in whom both of these diseases coexist. These patients constitute a diagnostic challenge because their presentation (ie, clinical symptoms, imaging abnormalities and even pathology) may all be atypical when each individual disease is considered separately. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with such atypical features and was eventually diagnosed as having both sarcoidosis and a B-cell lymphoma with features of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) simultaneously. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of SMZL and sarcoidosis in the same patient.

### Is endosonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for sarcoidosis as good as we think? [^112yRyeT]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Preliminary data show that endosonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may be an accurate method for diagnosing sarcoidosis. However, these data were obtained in a small selected group of patients with a very high pretest probability of sarcoidosis. This retrospective study reports on the use of EUS-FNA in an unselected group of patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown origin.

Methods

The EUS database of a single tertiary referral centre was reviewed for patients who underwent EUS-FNA for mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown origin. Clinical presentation and imaging studies of each case were carefully reviewed and the diagnosis "sarcoidosis" or "no sarcoidosis" attributed if possible. The diagnoses were compared with the result of EUS-FNA.

Results

One hundred and twenty four patients were investigated. In 35 cases EUS-FNA identified granulomas (group 1); in the other 89 cases (group 2) no granulomas were detected. The definite diagnoses in group 1 were sarcoidosis (n = 25), indefinite (n = 7), no sarcoidosis (n = 3). The definite diagnoses in group 2 were sarcoidosis (n = 3), indefinite (n = 9), no sarcoidosis (n = 77). Of the 77 cases with no sarcoidosis, 44 were diagnosed with other diseases. The other 33 showed non-specific changes in the FNA and sarcoidosis was excluded by negative non-EUS pathology (n = 17) and clinical presentation. The sensitivity and specificity for EUS-FNA were 89% (95% CI 82 to 94) and 96% (95% CI 91 to 98), respectively, after exclusion of the indefinite cases in both groups.

Conclusions

EUS-FNA is an accurate method for diagnosing sarcoidosis in an unselected group of patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The reported sensitivity and specificity must be appreciated in the context of the difficult and often incomplete clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

### Cervical abscess and mediastinal adenopathy: an unusual presentation of childhood histoplasmosis [^116EwT3M]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic respiratory mycosis in the United States. We report the clinical and imaging findings in a case of a child with the rare presentation of a neck abscess and mediastinal lymphadenopathy secondary to acute, non-disseminated histoplasmosis. Imaging findings often mimic other granulomatous infections such as tuberculosis or neoplastic processes such as lymphoma. Histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child who presents with enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymphadenopathy.

### Role of EUS for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy [^112GY4Ce]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Obtaining tissue from mediastinal adenopathy — cross-sectional imaging alone is insufficient and sampling methods are listed: "CT and PET scans can detect abnormal mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but are usually inadequate for diagnosis and locoregional staging of malignancy", so "tissue sampling is often required", with tissue obtainable "by needle techniques or surgical biopsy", including "transthoracic needle aspirate (TTNA), transbronchial needle aspirate (TBNA), EBUS-FNA".
