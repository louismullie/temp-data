## Question

Timeline of complications of amlodipine overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a timeline of complications after amlodipine overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about amlodipine pharmacokinetics and pathophysiology. Then, I should look for dose–response patterns and variability from human reports. Next, I will construct a phase-based clinical timeline with expected findings. After that, I need to identify high-risk variants that alter timing and severity. Then, I will translate these into practical observation and monitoring recommendations. Finally, I will integrate evidence-based treatment priorities and close with key takeaways and disposition guidance, anchoring each step to the best available references and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation and mechanism because the time course hinges on them; amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB with high protein binding and a large volume of distribution, a half-life around 30–50 hours, and delayed peak concentrations around 6–12 hours post ingestion, which explains prolonged and sometimes biphasic toxicity with early vasodilation followed by myocardial/conduction effects as selectivity is lost at toxic levels [^116D1t4Y].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response patterns and clinical variability across cases so I do not overgeneralize; FDA labeling captures extremes from an asymptomatic 250 mg ingestion to fatal shock with 70 mg plus benzodiazepine coingestion, while case reports describe severe outcomes at 280–400 mg and a 100 mg ingestion complicated by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema at 72 hours, and a 1000 mg ingestion with a sharp BP fall at 5–7 hours and protracted instability over days, underscoring that dose alone does not reliably predict timing or severity when formulation, coingestants, and host factors vary [^114tYXzM] [^115zFn2y] [^113ejrXW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially assumed dihydropyridines spare the myocardium, but at toxic levels vascular selectivity is lost, so beyond early vasodilatory shock with reflex tachycardia, myocardial depression, bradycardia, and conduction block emerge, with hyperglycemia from impaired insulin release, all of which pushes the timeline toward late deterioration if not anticipated [^116D1t4Y] [^112vZeVk].

> I will now outline Phase 1, the latent or preclinical window from 0 to about 6 hours; absorption and distribution dominate, many patients are initially asymptomatic, vital signs can be deceptively stable, and GI symptoms may be mild, but given delayed peak levels, early reassurance is risky in long-acting CCBs, especially with sustained-release forms in the class, so close observation is prudent [^116D1t4Y] [^1133KeJc].

> Next, I should review Phase 2, the early hemodynamic instability window from roughly 6 to 24 hours; as peak concentrations emerge, hypotension typically declares around 5–12 hours, initially with reflex tachycardia, then transitioning to bradycardia and conduction disturbances as myocardial calcium channels are increasingly affected, with fluids often inadequate and vasopressors required while calcium and high-dose insulin are considered early if myocardial dysfunction appears [^113xRK2V] [^114hSyqG] [^111BFBpn] [^117CZgkg].

> Let me consider Phase 3, the delayed critical complications window from about 24 to 72 hours; sustained drug levels and capillary effects raise the risk of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, often peaking between 48 and 72 hours, while refractory vasodilatory or mixed shock, advanced AV block requiring pacing, and metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia are prominent, with multiple reports documenting NCPE incidence and delayed presentations even after initial stabilization [^116D1t4Y] [^112vZeVk] [^113ejrXW].

> I should double-check Phase 4, the prolonged recovery period beyond 72 hours and extending up to 10 or more days in severe ingestions; given the 30–50 hour half-life, weaning from vasopressors and resolving pulmonary edema can be slow, and in extreme cases like 1000 mg overdoses, hemodynamic and thermal abnormalities persisted beyond a week, reinforcing the need for extended critical care in complicated cases [^116D1t4Y] [^113xRK2V].

> But wait, what if the formulation or coingestants alter the course; sustained-release CCBs in the class can markedly delay onset and peak effects warranting at least 48 hours of observation, whole-bowel irrigation may be harmful once hypotension develops, and coingestion with beta-blockers or CNS depressants can synergistically worsen shock and conduction abnormalities, including fatal outcomes reported with benzodiazepines [^1133KeJc] [^116i6kxW] [^114tYXzM].

> Let me first confirm appropriate decontamination timing because this is easy to misapply; guidelines support activated charcoal within 1 hour of a potentially toxic ingestion, yet amlodipine labeling notes reduced absorption up to 2 hours in volunteers, so if the airway is protected and logistics allow, a narrow window beyond 1 hour may still be reasonable case-by-case, though benefit diminishes with time and hemodynamic instability takes precedence [^115VqWjQ] [^115eWv8J].

> I need to ensure our monitoring and disposition plan matches the pharmacology and delayed hazards; a pragmatic approach is hospital admission with telemetry for any suspected toxic ingestion, at least 24 hours of observation even if initially asymptomatic, extend to 48 hours or longer when the dose is clearly toxic or the formulation is sustained-release within the CCB class, and escalate to 72–96 hours if any hemodynamic instability, hyperglycemia, conduction disturbance, or early pulmonary findings arise, with targeted vigilance for NCPE between 48 and 72 hours [^116UApcQ] [^1133KeJc] [^113ejrXW] [^116D1t4Y].

> Hold on, I should verify what "discharge ready" looks like to avoid premature step-down; a reasonable threshold is over 24 hours asymptomatic on telemetry with stable hemodynamics without vasoactive support, no evolving conduction abnormalities, and no evidence of pulmonary edema on exam or oxygen requirement, recognizing that any earlier instability or larger ingestions should prompt extended observation given the drug's long half-life and documented late decompensation [^116D1t4Y] [^113ejrXW].

> Next, I should review first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, aligning with consensus guidance; initiate IV calcium promptly, start norepinephrine for vasoplegic shock and add epinephrine or dobutamine if cardiogenic features are present, and begin high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy early when myocardial dysfunction is suspected, titrating up to 10 U/kg/h with meticulous glucose and potassium monitoring alongside dextrose support [^111BFBpn] [^114hSyqG] [^117CZgkg] [^112FKRP8] [^113K6wu1].

> I should confirm rescue strategies for refractory shock or peri-arrest because delays here increase mortality; lipid emulsion therapy may be considered as rescue, transcutaneous then transvenous pacing for unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, and VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock at capable centers, with repeated calcium and lipid boluses in cardiac arrest as per guidance [^1125uNPR] [^111e8MLq] [^111giqfP].

> Let me reconsider adjuncts for distributive components when catecholamines and insulin are insufficient; methylene blue has mechanistic plausibility as an NO–cGMP pathway inhibitor with mixed human and animal data, and exogenous angiotensin II has shown hemodynamic rescue in refractory antihypertensive overdoses, so both may be considered case-by-case with toxicology input when conventional therapy fails [^115qmQRf] [^111Zdv39] [^114DLASj] [^111Ex26i] [^116bBdy8] [^116WHUsR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked glucose dynamics; hyperglycemia is common from impaired calcium-dependent insulin release and serves as a clinical clue favoring early high-dose insulin therapy, and its correction correlates with improved myocardial carbohydrate utilization, which is integral to reversing shock physiology in both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine CCB toxicity [^112vZeVk] [^115XEjy2].

> I will now synthesize the timeline succinctly to guide bedside anticipation; early latent phase 0–6 hours with potential deceptively normal vitals, early hemodynamic phase 6–24 hours with hypotension and evolving conduction effects, delayed critical phase 24–72 hours with peak risk for NCPE and refractory shock, and prolonged resolution beyond 72 hours with slow hemodynamic and pulmonary recovery due to the long half-life, all modulated by formulation and coingestants [^116D1t4Y] [^113ejrXW] [^113xRK2V] [^1133KeJc].

> Finally, I should emphasize the key clinical takeaways to prevent missed late deterioration; amlodipine overdoses behave like time-delayed threats because of slow kinetics, the 48–72 hour window is the danger zone for NCPE even after initial improvement, dose does not linearly predict timing or severity, and polypharmacy — especially beta-blockers or CNS depressants — can precipitate earlier, more severe shock, arguing for extended observation and early multimodal therapy with toxicology consultation [^116D1t4Y] [^113ejrXW] [^114tYXzM] [^115XEjy2].

Amlodipine overdose typically has a **delayed, prolonged course**: early hypotension [^115eWv8J] with reflex tachycardia is followed over 24–72 hours by bradycardia, conduction defects, and multi-organ dysfunction [^114zCMzw]. **Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema** often develops after 24 hours [^113ejrXW] [^112vZeVk], and refractory shock or cardiac arrest [^114hSyqG] may occur at any stage, sometimes necessitating ECMO or other rescue therapies [^112g7QJg] [^111giqfP] [^116D1t4Y].

| **Timeframe** | **Clinical complications** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–6 hours | - Hypotension [^115eWv8J] <br/> - Reflex tachycardia [^116D1t4Y] <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting | Peripheral vasodilation leads to baroreceptor-mediated reflex tachycardia |
| 6–12 hours | - Persistent hypotension [^115eWv8J] <br/> - Bradycardia [^116D1t4Y] <br/> - Conduction abnormalities (PR prolongation, AV block) [^111mdnLR] <br/> - Metabolic acidosis <br/> - Hyperglycemia | - Loss of vascular selectivity <br/> - Myocardial depression <br/> - Impaired insulin secretion [^116D1t4Y] |
| 12–24 hours | - Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^112vZeVk] <br/> - Acute kidney injury <br/> - Hepatic dysfunction <br/> - Altered mental status | - Capillary leak <br/> - Organ hypoperfusion <br/> - Direct organ toxicity |
| 24–72 hours | - Refractory shock [^114hSyqG] <br/> - Cardiac arrest [^112g7QJg] <br/> - Multi-organ failure [^114zCMzw] <br/> - Delayed pulmonary edema [^113ejrXW] | - Persistent vasodilation [^116D1t4Y] <br/> - Myocardial depression [^111giqfP] <br/> - Progressive organ dysfunction |

Delayed complications — such as **non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema** and **multi-organ failure** — are common [^116D1t4Y]. Prolonged monitoring is essential [^113ejrXW] given amlodipine's **long half-life** [^116D1t4Y] and **large volume of distribution** [^116D1t4Y].

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^116D1t4Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), which is widely available and has a variety of indicated usages. It is highly protein-bound, has a large volume of distribution, and a half-life of 30–50 hours. Dihydropyridines preferentially block the L-type calcium channels in the peripheral vasculature. At standard doses, these medications are potent vasodilators, but have little negative inotropic or chronotropic effect. In comparison, standard doses of the non-dihydropyridines, such as verapamil and diltiazem, selectively block L-type calcium channels in the myocardium, leading to reduced cardiac conduction and contractility with weak vasodilatory effects.

Dihydropyridine intoxication initially results in arterial vasodilation and reflex tachycardia, but as doses increase, receptor selectivity is lost. At toxic levels, dihydropyridines may negatively affect the myocardium and cardiac conduction system, leading to decreased inotropy, bradycardia, and heart block. Amlodipine toxicity-induced atrioventricular conduction disturbances range from prolonged PR intervals to complete atrioventricular dissociation with accelerated junctional rhythm. Additionally, CCBs selectively dilate the afferent branch of capillary networks which, in states of preserved or increased blood flow, may lead to edema formation including non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE). A cohort study by Erik et al. investigated amlodipine poisoning and found an incidence of 47% of NCPE in the whole cohort and 64% among those who did not develop complete hemodynamic collapse.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^112ydmnh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) commonly used in the management of essential hypertension and angina pectoris. Unlike other CCBs, amlodipine has a low metabolic clearance, allowing for a once-daily dosage to maintain a near-constant plasma concentration.

CCBs are widely prescribed cardiovascular medications with potentially lethal adverse effects even at mild overdoses. The management of CCB overdose is mainly supportive, involving various measures such as gastrointestinal decontamination, fluid resuscitation, intravenous calcium, vasopressor agents, atropine, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy (HIET), and cardiac pacing. Recently, intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy has emerged as a promising strategy in the management of CCB toxicity. ILE has been previously used in local anaesthetic toxicity, and recent case reports highlight its use as an antidote for a wide range of lipophilic xenobiotic poisonings. ILE used in CCB toxicity has demonstrated mixed results, showing some efficacy alongside the unique complication of preventing the use of renal replacement therapy.

We review the literature and discuss the need for further research into CCB intoxication and its potentially fatal consequences.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^111giqfP]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For patients experiencing calcium channel blocker (CCB) poisoning in refractory shock or periarrest, despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors, the workgroup recommends the following rescue treatments:

- **High-dose insulin therapy**: Incremental doses up to 10 U/kg/hr if there is evidence of myocardial dysfunction and if not administered previously.
- **Lipid-emulsion therapy**: Administer if not given previously.

Additionally, for CCB-poisoned patients in refractory shock or periarrest, the workgroup suggests these rescue treatments:

- **High-dose insulin therapy**: Incremental doses up to 10 U/kg/hr even if myocardial dysfunction is absent, if not previously administered.
- **VA-ECMO**: Implement in the presence of cardiogenic shock at centers where this treatment is available.
- **Pacemaker**: Use in cases of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropy, if not tried before.

The rationale behind these recommendations lies in the high risk of mortality in patients with severe refractory shock or periarrest. The workgroup considered therapies with less evidence or greater risk. Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy are suggested even when no myocardial dysfunction has been documented, and lipid-emulsion therapy is recommended in such situations.

Due to the risk of mortality in severely poisoned patients and the potential survival benefits demonstrated in an observational study conducted in experienced centers, the workgroup has recommended these therapies accordingly.

### Delayed onset of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema following amlodipine overdose [^113ejrXW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Amlodipine, a widely used antihypertensive medication, can cause serious complications in overdose, including hypotension, bradycardia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPO), and death. This report describes a young adult woman who ingested 100 mg of amlodipine in a polypharmacy suicide attempt. Although she initially stabilized, she unexpectedly developed delayed NCPO three days post-ingestion, requiring intubation and intensive care unit readmission. She recovered fully with supportive care and was discharged in good health. This case highlights the importance of prolonged monitoring and vigilance in managing long-acting calcium channel blocker overdoses, even when the initial clinical response appears satisfactory.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^1176sZZc]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who intentionally ingested 400 mg of amlodipine in a suicidal attempt. She initially presented with hypotension, which persisted despite aggressive therapy with fluid resuscitation, multiple pressor support, high-dose insulin therapy, and calcium infusion. Her haemodynamic instability evolved to include bradycardia, requiring atropine and transcutaneous pacing. Eventually, she required salvage therapy with intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy. Despite all aggressive therapies, she developed multi-organ failure resulting in death.

The literature on high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy (HIET) and ILE therapy shows mixed results, with some cases showing significant improvement in haemodynamic status. In our case, however, it had no significant positive impact on the outcome.

### Lotrel [^114tYXzM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Only a few cases of human overdose with amlodipine have been reported. One patient was asymptomatic following a 250 mg ingestion, while another, who combined 70 mg of amlodipine with an unknown large quantity of a benzodiazepine, developed refractory shock and died.

Human overdoses with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril have not been reported. In scattered reports of human overdoses with benazepril and other ACE inhibitors, there are no reports of death.

- **Treatment**: Patients should be admitted to the hospital and, in general, managed in an intensive care setting with continuous monitoring of cardiac function, blood gases, and blood biochemistry. Emergency supportive measures, such as artificial ventilation or cardiac pacing, should be instituted if appropriate.

In the event of a potentially life-threatening oral overdose, use induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, or activated charcoal to remove the drug from the gastrointestinal tract (only if presented within one hour after ingestion of Lotrel).

Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically, based on modern methods of intensive care.

To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a useful resource is your certified Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison-control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

### Methylene blue reverses recalcitrant shock in β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose [^111Zdv39]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). High credibility.

β-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity generally present with bradycardia and hypotension. A 69-year-old woman presented following a suicide attempt with a β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. Her blood pressure was 69/35 mm Hg, and her heart rate was in the 40s. She was treated with calcium chloride, glucagon, a dextrose-insulin infusion, and three vasopressors, but remained hypotensive.

She suffered two cardiac arrests and required a transvenous pacemaker. When all interventions failed, she was started on a methylene blue infusion for refractory vasodilatory shock, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in her blood pressure. The patient was successfully weaned off all vasopressors and from mechanical ventilation without any end-organ damage.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^113XbudT]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and agitation following an intentional overdose with 40 tablets of her 10 mg amlodipine prescription. A friend contacted medics and raised concern for potential overdose, with an estimated time of ingestion 12 hours prior to presentation. On initial presentation, the patient was hypotensive but was otherwise not bradycardic and had an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15.

Medical history was significant for noncompliance with medical follow-up and medication adherence, schizoaffective disorder with previous suicide attempts, poorly controlled hypertension, and dextrocardia.

### A case of angiotensin II utilization for refractory shock in a polysubstance overdose [^116WHUsR]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Low credibility.

Amlodipine and quetiapine are widely utilized medications that are generally well-tolerated at therapeutic doses. However, overdoses can lead to severe, life-threatening cardiovascular effects, resulting in refractory vasoplegia. The management of poly-ingestion overdoses is challenging and often requires aggressive, multimodal treatment strategies, especially when the causative agent is unknown.

In this case report, a 38-year-old male intentionally ingested a large amount of amlodipine and quetiapine, resulting in refractory shock despite high doses of vasopressors, calcium, and insulin therapy. After conventional therapies failed, the administration of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II), a vasoconstrictor traditionally used for septic shock, led to a marked improvement in the patient's blood pressure and stabilization of hemodynamics.

Sixty minutes after initiation of Ang II, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) improved, allowing for the weaning of other vasopressors and a gradual reduction in insulin therapy. This case highlights the potential role of Ang II as a salvage therapy in polysubstance ingestions when other therapies fail.

### Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and life-threatening shock due to calcium channel blocker overdose: a case report and clinical review [^112vZeVk]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose can be life-threatening when it manifests as catastrophic shock and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. We describe a case of massive overdose of multiple medications, including sustained-release verapamil, which was resistant to conventional support. Initial treatment for CCB overdose is primarily supportive and includes fluid resuscitation. The mechanism of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not well understood, and reported cases have been successfully treated with mechanical ventilation.

Circulatory shock may fail to respond to atropine, glucagon, and calcium in severely poisoned patients, and vasopressors are usually required. Attempting to overcome calcium-channel antagonism with supra-therapeutic doses of calcium salts is clinically indicated to reverse hypotension and bradycardia. There is evidence that hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy is superior to other therapies for CCB poisoning. The mechanism is thought to be the insulin-mediated active transport of glucose into the cells, countering the CCB-induced intracellular carbohydrate-deficient state.

Conventional decontamination measures are ineffective in accelerating the clearance of CCB. Experience with intravenous lipid emulsion for lipophilic drug overdose, such as verapamil, is limited but has been proposed as a rescue therapy. It might improve cardiac inotropy through intravascular sequestration of the lipophilic CCB.

### Critical care management of verapamil and diltiazem overdose with a focus on vasopressors: A 25-year experience at a single center [^116jRkt9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Verapamil or diltiazem overdose can cause severe morbidity and death, and there exist limited human data describing the management and outcome of a large number of such patients. This article describes the management and outcome of patients with nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker overdose, with an emphasis on vasopressor dosing, at a single center.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart review of patients older than 14 years who were admitted to the inpatient toxicology service of a single tertiary care medical center for treatment of verapamil or diltiazem overdose from 1987 through 2012 and who had the presence of either drug confirmed by urine drug screening. Patients were identified by a review of patient encounter logs. Data abstracted from medical records included demographics, laboratory results, drugs used to support blood pressure, complications, and outcomes. A second group included patients with a reported calcium channel blocker ingestion but for whom results of the urine drug testing were no longer available. In an effort to assess selection bias, this group was included to determine whether patients who were excluded from the primary group only because of unavailability of urine drug screen results had different outcomes.

- **Results**: During the study period, 48 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 45 years, with a range of 15 to 76 years, and 52% were male patients. Verapamil accounted for 24 of 48 (50%) ingestions. Vasopressors were administered to 33 of 48 (69%) patients.

### Efficacy of methylene blue in a murine model of amlodipine overdose [^114DLASj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Amlodipine overdoses have significant cardiac toxicity and are difficult to treat. Methylene blue has potential as a treatment for overdoses.

- **Methods**: A randomized controlled study of methylene blue as a treatment for amlodipine toxicity was conducted in C57Bl/6 mice. A baseline echocardiography was followed by gavage administration of amlodipine (90 mg/kg). Five minutes after gavage, animals received either a vehicle solution (controls) or methylene blue (20 mg/kg) by intra-peritoneal injection. Animals were continuously monitored, and cardiac parameters were acquired every 15 minutes up to two hours.

- **Results**: Only 50% of control animals survived to the two-hour endpoint compared to 83% that received methylene blue. Amlodipine delivery induced significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) in the vehicle-treated animals relative to animals in the treatment group (p < 0.05 vehicle versus methylene blue for EF, FS, SV, and CO).

- **Discussion**: The amlodipine dose induced cardiotoxicity, with effects more pronounced in the untreated group. Fifty percent of vehicle controls quickly progressed into heart failure (within 90 minutes of exposure) and did not survive the two-hour observation endpoint. Distinctly, only one animal from the methylene blue treatment group did not survive (83% survival). Additionally, the surviving animals from the methylene blue group displayed significantly higher ejection fraction, fractional shortening, stroke volume, and cardiac output compared to vehicle controls.

### Whole bowel irrigation and the hemodynamically unstable calcium channel blocker overdose: Primum non nocere [^116i6kxW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sustained-release calcium channel blocker (CCB SR) overdoses are potentially life-threatening ingestions. These patients may not become hemodynamically unstable until many hours after ingestion. On theoretical grounds, some have suggested that whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution may be of value in the management of these cases. We report two cases with poor outcomes (including one fatality) that were complicated by the use of WBI. Both cases were treated with WBI beginning before and continuing after developing hypotension. WBI should be avoided in the setting of the hemodynamically unstable CCB SR overdose.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116dGRPH]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Toxicity from cardiac drugs is associated with numerous fatalities and significant morbidity. Furthermore, the advice given by poison control centers is often not adhered to. Consensus recommendations were published for the out-of-hospital management of calcium channel blocker (CCB) ingestion, but systematic recommendations for in-hospital care have not yet been developed.

In the absence of formally recognized guidelines, we convened a workgroup of experts involved in the care of poisoned patients to develop evidence-based recommendations guiding the in-hospital management of CCB poisoning. Given the very low evidence level in the literature, the workgroup agreed on developing expert consensus recommendations to propose a management approach and facilitate knowledge translation. In light of the variable pharmacokinetics among the available CCBs, the altered pharmacokinetics following overdose, and the loss of selectivity at very high CCB doses, the workgroup adopted a pragmatic clinical approach and did not focus on individual agents. For complementary information concerning CCB poisoning, see Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Pharmacological and mechanical management of calcium channel blocker toxicity [^115s8PUm]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular instability associated with calcium channel blocker toxicity comprises a small percentage of overdose presentations, yet they are associated with a high mortality rate. We detail the management of a 64-year-old man who took an intentional overdose of 840mg nimodipine. We include the treatment he received and highlight the scarcity of evidence behind the use of gastric decontamination, calcium, glucagon, intravenous lipid emulsion, high-dose insulin therapy, sodium bicarbonate, vasopressors, and methylene blue in calcium channel blocker toxicity. Additionally, the article explores the use of electrical pacing and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).

Following successful weaning of VA-ECMO, the patient was successfully extubated but remained neurologically impaired due to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, critical care polyneuropathy, and renal failure requiring dialysis. He has cerebral performance category 3; he has mild cognitive impairment but is able to perform some activities of daily living independently and communicate his thoughts and needs. He requires no respiratory or cardiovascular support.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^114zCMzw]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

**Learning points**: Patient presenting with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as amlodipine intoxication, can experience multi-organ dysfunction and will immediately need to be managed in the intensive care unit. Monitoring for anticipated complications and targeted management of these complications can be lifesaving. Early initiation of high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy has been proven effective in some cases of CCBs toxicity and should be considered.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^117GTHp2]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In patients refractory to the first-line treatments, the workgroup considered therapies supported by a limited number of case series and associated with a moderate risk. Therapies associated with higher risks were kept for rescue treatments. Therefore, in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, the workgroup suggested titrating high-dose insulin infusion rates up to 10 U/kg/hr to improve inotropy and facilitate the use of carbohydrates by the myocardium. This should be accompanied by a dextrose infusion to maintain euglycemia if needed.

Pacing has been associated with frequent capture and pacing problems. However, there may be hemodynamic improvement in patients presenting with unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block. To avoid spending time on a therapy that involves risk and may not be effective, the workgroup suggested attempting transcutaneous pacing first. If transcutaneous pacing is effective, IV pacing can be instituted when clinically appropriate.

Based on possible hemodynamic improvement documented in animal studies, case series, and case reports, the workgroup also suggested the use of lipid-emulsion therapy. However, this is not recommended earlier in therapy in the absence of cardiac arrest, given the inconsistent response and the concern of potentially increasing the absorption of medications still present in the gastrointestinal tract by changing the distribution of the CCB. This concern was reported in an animal study that was only published as an abstract at the time of analysis, showing worse outcomes with an oral model of CCB poisoning.

### Amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113FEbbC]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to report a case of amlodipine-induced dermatotoxicity following treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Although other members of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been reported to cause dermatotoxic reactions, this is the first report attributing this effect to amlodipine.

A 71-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman had been noted to have worsened renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia attributed to enalapril, thus a trial of amlodipine was begun. On day 12 of amlodipine therapy, the patient developed a pruritic maculopapular rash on her hands for which she sought medical attention. On day 16, she presented again to the emergency department, now with hives and small blisters involving the trunk and arms with approximately 25% TBSA involvement, warranting transfer to a regional burn treatment center. The rash progressed after admission to 48.5% TBSA and included conjunctival sloughing. The patient's hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged after 8 days.

Drug-induced dermatotoxicity presenting as toxic epidermal necrolysis is often caused by antibiotics and antiepileptic medications; however, calcium channel blockers are an uncommon cause. The Naranjo assessment yielded a score of 5, and the SCORTEN was 4, with a predicted mortality of 58%. This report represents the first published case of amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^115eWv8J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In cases of overdosage with **amlodipine**, single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively, have caused deaths. Single oral doses equivalent to 4 or more mg/kg in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on an mg/m² basis) resulted in marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. Overdosage is likely to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with significant hypotension. In humans, experience with intentional amlodipine overdosage is limited. There have been reports of prolonged systemic hypotension leading to shock and potentially fatal outcomes.

If a massive overdose occurs, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, cardiovascular support, including elevation of the extremities and cautious fluid administration, should be enacted. If hypotension does not respond to these measures, consider the use of vasopressors, such as phenylephrine, while monitoring circulating volume and urine output. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial. Administration of activated charcoal shortly or up to two hours after ingestion in healthy volunteers has been shown to significantly decrease absorption.

Regarding **valsartan**, limited data regarding human overdosage is available. The most probable effects of overdose include peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and tachycardia; however, bradycardia could also occur.

### Methylene blue in the treatment of refractory shock from an amlodipine overdose [^115qmQRf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a potent vasodilator with a long half-life and delayed onset of action, which is particularly concerning after an overdose. Vasodilation occurs through stimulation of nitric oxide release with increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Methylene blue inhibits guanylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for the production of cGMP. It also has the ability to scavenge nitric oxide and inhibit nitric oxide synthase. We report the use of methylene blue for refractory shock in a patient with amlodipine toxicity.

### Verelan PM [^114jrJp8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In cases of verapamil overdosage, there is no specific antidote; treatment must be supportive. With sustained-release formulations, delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur. Patients should be observed for at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Reported effects of overdosage include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and decreased mental status. Additionally, there have been literature reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients consuming large overdoses of verapamil, up to approximately 9 grams.

In acute overdosage situations, consider gastrointestinal decontamination using cathartics and whole bowel irrigation. Calcium, inotropes (i.e. isoproterenol HCl, dopamine HCl, and glucagon), atropine sulfate, vasopressors (i.e. norepinephrine and epinephrine), and cardiac pacing have been employed with variable success to reverse hypotension and myocardial depression. Notably, cases of overdose with calcium channel blockers initially refractory to atropine showed improved responsiveness when patients received large doses of calcium chloride (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours).

Calcium chloride is preferred over calcium gluconate since it provides three times more calcium per volume. Asystole should be managed with standard procedures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Verapamil is not removable by hemodialysis.

Uncommon adverse reactions (less than 1%) associated with the use of amlodipine besylate PO (also known as Norvasc) include acute pancreatitis, angioedema, anxiety, and back pain. Additional reactions are increased blood glucose, change in taste, conjunctivitis, constipation, depression, diaphoresis, and diplopia. Symptoms such as dry mouth, dysphagia, dysuria, erythema multiforme, eye pain, flatulence, gingival swelling, and heart failure may also occur. Other side effects include hypoesthesia, insomnia, loss of appetite, malaise, muscle cramps, nervousness, and nightmares. Patients might experience nocturia, nosebleed, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, decreased platelet count, pruritus, purpura, and rigors. Conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, tachycardia, tinnitus, tremor, urinary frequency, vasculitis, vertigo, vomiting, decreased WBC count, and fluctuations in weight, both gain and loss, have also been reported.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^117BbpJA]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who intentionally ingested 400 mg of amlodipine in a suicidal attempt, initially presenting with hypotension which persisted despite aggressive therapy with fluid resuscitation, multiple pressor support, high-dose insulin therapy, and calcium infusion. Her hemodynamic instability evolved to include bradycardia requiring atropine and transcutaneous pacing. Eventually, she required salvage therapy with intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy. Despite all aggressive therapy, she developed multi-organ failure resulting in death.

The literature on high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy (HIET) and ILE therapy shows mixed results, with some showing significant improvement in hemodynamic status. In our case, it had no significant positive impact on the outcome.

### Blood pressure variability in clinical practice: Past, present and the future [^112Vijcq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

A post hoc analysis of two large-scale studies showed that the use of amlodipine (calcium channel blocker) to stabilize BPV led to a decrease in the incidence of coronary events. In a systematic review on the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the management of BPV, long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (dihydropyridine calcium antagonists) were noted to be the most effective treatment for BPV control. The study Heart also noted that monotherapy or, in combination, CCBs had been associated with the most effective long-term BPV lowering. Liu et al. noted that CCBs were most effective in reducing BPV and related organ damage in hypertensive rat models.

Another study has shown that calcium antagonists or diuretics have the most significant effects on the control of BPV, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers may even lead to an increase in BPV. Another study compared responses in patients with hypertension to valsartan versus amlodipine. The author reported that, compared with patients in the valsartan group, the amlodipine group showed a higher decline (by 1.4 mm Hg) in visit-to-visit systolic BPV. It is important to note that patients with the highest visit-to-visit BPV and more cardiovascular risk factors were more often treated with valsartan compared with amlodipine. It is crucial to note that drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have been shown to offer superior protection against cardiovascular events than CCBs.

In specific circumstances of cardiac arrest, particularly in patients with calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose, the 2017 guidelines from AAPCC, ACMT, CAEP, CAPCC, CCCS, CPS, EAPCCT, ESEM, ESICM, and SCCM recommend considering the following rescue treatments for patients with CCB poisoning in refractory shock or peri-arrest situations, despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors:

- **Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy**: Administer up to 10 U/kg/hour if there is evidence of myocardial dysfunction and if it has not been administered previously.

- **Lipid-emulsion therapy**: Consider administering if it has not been administered previously.

### Development and feasibility of a porcine model of amlodipine toxicity [^112uya73]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Low credibility.

Toxicity related to calcium-channel blockers remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Amlodipine-induced shock is unique in that its mechanism of action is thought to occur in part via the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the peripheral vasculature. Specific therapeutic interventions, including methylene blue (an NO scavenger), have been suggested, but efficacy studies are severely limited. To facilitate a larger porcine study into the effect of various interventions on amlodipine toxicity, we undertook this model development and feasibility study.

- **Methods**: Intravenous amlodipine was prepared by dissolving commercially obtained amlodipine tablets in dimethylsulfoxide. The concentration of the drug was verified using ultraviolet spectroscopy. We administered this solution to three animals in order to determine a toxic dose capable of facilitating a two-arm study of amlodipine toxicity.

- **Results**: The first pig died rapidly after the bolus infusion. The second pig developed mild toxicity, but the dissolution of the plastic tubing by the solvent and subsequent leakage limited the interpretability of the result. The third animal developed expected toxicity with an infusion rate between 2.0 and 5.5 mg/kg/h.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates a potentially repeatable model of amlodipine-induced toxic shock using intravenous administration of amlodipine and several methodological considerations for researchers undertaking similar work.

### Effect of methylene blue on a porcine model of amlodipine toxicity [^111Ex26i]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdoses cause significant morbidity and mortality. Dihydropyridine CCBs can lead to peripheral vascular dilation and, in high doses, cardiac dysfunction. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine, causes peripheral vasodilation through the release of nitric oxide (NO) in addition to calcium channel blockade; NO scavenging is a potential treatment. Methylene blue (MB) inhibits NO directly and inhibits NO production. We compared the effects of MB versus norepinephrine (NE), with time to death as the primary outcome, in a porcine amlodipine toxicity model.

- **Methods**: Animals were anesthetized and instrumented, and an amlodipine infusion was administered to mimic oral overdose. After 70 minutes, each group was resuscitated with normal saline. Animals in each group were then randomized to receive either MB or NE. Hemodynamic parameters, including mean arterial pressure and cardiac output, were recorded every 10 minutes. The primary outcome was survival time (Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test).

- **Results**: Interim analysis after 15 animals (7 MB, 8 NE) revealed that MB was clearly not superior to NE. Overall, 1 of 7 animals in the MB group survived to 300 minutes compared with 2 of 8 animals in the NE group. The median survival time was 100 minutes for the MB group and 177 minutes for the NE group. Survival time did not differ by group (log-rank test p = 0.29).

- **Conclusion**: In this porcine model of amlodipine toxicity, methylene blue did not improve survival time compared with norepinephrine. Whether methylene blue is beneficial in combating distributive shock remains uncertain.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^112BwxnZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Take amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets exactly as your healthcare provider instructs. Do not change your dose or discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets without consulting your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may conduct blood tests to monitor your cholesterol levels during treatment, and your dosage may be adjusted based on these results.

Take the tablets daily at any time, with or without food. Do not break the tablets before ingestion. Consult your healthcare provider if you have difficulty swallowing pills. You may be advised to start a cholesterol-lowering diet prior to beginning amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets, and it is important to maintain this low-fat diet during treatment.

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it has been more than 12 hours since the missed dose, skip it and take the next dose at your regular time. Do not take two doses simultaneously. In the event of an overdose, contact your doctor or the Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222, or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116WNPQy]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Observational studies, case series, and animal studies document an improvement in contractility, blood pressure, and a potential increase in survival with the use of high-dose insulin in CCB-poisoned patients. Considering that high-dose insulin seems to have a direct positive inotropic effect, the workgroup recommended its use in the face of documented myocardial dysfunction, but still suggested its use if myocardial dysfunction is not documented because case series documented hemodynamic improvement even with dihydropyridines poisoning. Despite the fact that high-dose insulin requires intensive monitoring, its benefits were thought to outweigh the risks such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, or volume overload.

The proposed dose regimen of high-dose insulin (regular insulin) includes a bolus of 1 U/kg followed by an infusion of 1 U/kg/hr, with maintenance of euglycemia with a dextrose infusion as needed, and close monitoring of serum potassium. Because titration of high-dose insulin to response up to 10 U/kg/hr is supported only by case series, the workgroup suggests using this dosage only for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies.

- **Vasopressor selection**: The selection of vasopressors should be guided by the type of shock. Based on the mechanism of action, the workgroup recommended the use of norepinephrine to increase blood pressure in vasoplegic shock or if myocardial function has not yet been assessed. The use of epinephrine is also recommended for a CCB-poisoned patient in shock to increase contractility and heart rate.

### Cardiotoxic medication poisoning [^115XEjy2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). High credibility.

Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers result in a disproportionate number of fatalities from cardiac medication overdoses and share similar characteristics. High-dose insulin is a superior therapy for both overdoses and is likely synergistic with vasopressors; therefore, we recommend starting vasopressors and high-dose insulin simultaneously. Digoxin remains an important cardiac poison and can likely be safely treated with smaller doses of fab fragments than in the past, except for patients in extremis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive but promising nonspecific therapy for refractory shock from cardiotoxic overdose and should be considered primarily in cases of refractory cardiogenic shock.

### Mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque stabilization for a lipophilic calcium antagonist amlodipine [^116iqRLc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from atherosclerosis, a vascular disorder characterized by abnormalities in vasoconstriction and endothelial function, ultimately leading to partial or complete vessel occlusion. Since the atherosclerotic plaque is marked by changes in calcium regulation, there has been interest in a potential antiatherosclerotic role for calcium antagonists. Supporting this hypothesis, a recent clinical study demonstrated in patients with CAD that treatment with the lipophilic dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonist amlodipine resulted in significantly fewer cardiovascular procedures and events.

- **Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT)**: Evaluated the effects of amlodipine on the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary and carotid arteries in 825 patients with documented CAD. The results showed that patients receiving amlodipine had marked reductions in hospitalization for revascularization and unstable angina compared to placebo in a population consisting of either normotensive or controlled hypertensive patients. Ultrasound approaches determined that amlodipine therapy was also associated with significant slowing in carotid atherosclerosis — an important surrogate marker for CAD — over a 3-year period. This vascular-wall benefit associated with amlodipine treatment was not related to changes in blood pressure.

The findings from PREVENT were consistent with a second reported study known as the Coronary Angioplasty Amlodipine Restenosis Study (CAPARES).

### Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [^112buLBK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Overdosage: Only a few cases of human overdose with amlodipine have been reported. One patient was asymptomatic after ingesting 250 mg; another, who combined 70 mg of amlodipine with an unknown large quantity of a benzodiazepine, developed refractory shock and died.

Human overdoses with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril have not been reported. In scattered reports of human overdoses with benazepril and other ACE inhibitors, there are no reports of death.

- **Treatment**: Patients should be admitted to hospital and generally managed in an intensive care setting, with continuous monitoring of cardiac function, blood gases, and blood biochemistry. Emergency supportive measures, such as artificial ventilation or cardiac pacing, should be instituted if appropriate.

- **Oral overdose**: In the event of a potentially life-threatening oral overdose, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal should be used to remove the drug from the gastrointestinal tract, but only if presented within 1 hour after ingestion of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care.

- **Additional resources**: To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified regional poison-control center. Telephone numbers of certified poison-control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

### Conjupri [^11159i3p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited.

Single oral doses of amlodipine equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 4 mg or more amlodipine/kg in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m² basis) caused marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.

If a massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support, including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider the administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein-bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^116P5BGJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis includes several possibilities. Given that the collateral history indicated a known toxic ingestion and laboratory work showed acute metabolic disturbances, the primary differential diagnoses considered were the possible co-ingestion of other pharmaceutical agents or illicit substances. Additional considerations included an acute psychotic episode, infection, and less likely, hepatic encephalopathy or myxoedema.

### Temperature and blood pressure following amlodipine overdose [^113xRK2V]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular system participates in both blood pressure (BP) and temperature regulation. As a result, salt ingestion creates conflict between BP and temperature homeostasis, as vasodilatation that would promptly lower the BP would simultaneously increase cutaneous blood flow, thereby accelerating heat loss. If temperature homeostasis has precedence over blood pressure homeostasis, as postulated by the thermoregulatory-vascular remodeling (TVR) hypothesis, then in order to minimize heat loss, BP remains elevated following salt ingestion until the kidneys excrete the excess salt.

A case of amlodipine overdose offered an opportunity to test a corollary of the TVR hypothesis: vasodilators should cause a drop in body temperature and/or an increase in the metabolic rate. Following the ingestion of 1000 mg of amlodipine, the temperature and BP of a single patient were monitored during the initial 36 hours and during the 13th day of hospitalization. The BP dropped markedly between the fifth and seventh hours post-ingestion, but then rose steadily and normalized by 28 hours post-ingestion. The temperature was normal at 7 hours post-ingestion, declined gradually between the seventh and 26th hours post-ingestion, stabilized between the 26th and 31st hours post-ingestion, then began to rise. During this case of amlodipine overdose, a modest temperature decline lagged behind a marked BP decline. As the BP rose, the temperature also rose, but lagged behind the BP increases. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between BP and temperature and are consistent with the TVR hypothesis.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^117RzUvk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery for a patient poisoned by a specific agent depend largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually, the drug or toxin can be quickly identified through a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

Despite multiple treatment options, antihypertensive overdose remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Intravenous angiotensin II (AG II) is approved for use in vasodilatory shock. We describe two cases of refractory shock from antihypertensive overdose that were successfully treated using AG II.

- **Case reports**: A 24-year-old female presented after an overdose of multiple antihypertensive medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). She developed hypotension that was refractory to norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 57 mm Hg nine hours after emergency department arrival. Fifteen minutes after starting AG II at 10 ng/kg/min, her heart rate and MAP rose by 7 beats/min and 12 mm Hg, respectively. Her hemodynamic parameters continued to improve thereafter, and she developed acute kidney injury, which resolved prior to discharge. The second patient, a 65-year-old male, presented after an overdose of multiple antihypertensive medications, including an ACEI. Despite norepinephrine, epinephrine, and hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia, he remained bradycardic and hypotensive, with a heart rate of 47 beats/min and MAP of 59 mm Hg. Thirty minutes after starting AG II at 10 ng/kg/min, his heart rate was 61 beats/min and MAP was 66 mm Hg. He recovered without apparent sequelae.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: Antihypertensive overdose can lead to shock refractory to catecholamine and vasopressin therapy. Our experience suggests that AG II is efficacious in antihypertensive overdose situations.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^112FKRP8]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, and more specifically with respect to vasopressors, AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend considering dobutamine or epinephrine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning with cardiogenic shock.

### Verelan [^111RrvD4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There is no specific antidote for verapamil overdosage; treatment should be supportive. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with sustained-release formulations, and patients should be observed for at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Reported effects include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and decreased mental status. Additionally, literature reports have documented cases of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients ingesting large overdoses of verapamil (up to approximately 9g).

In acute overdosage, gastrointestinal decontamination with cathartics and whole bowel irrigation should be considered. Calcium, inotropes (such as isoproterenol, dopamine, and glucagon), atropine, vasopressors (such as norepinephrine and epinephrine), and cardiac pacing have been utilized with variable results to reverse hypotension and myocardial depression. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to this treatment when patients received large doses (close to 1g/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is preferred over calcium gluconate since it provides three times more calcium per volume. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is important to note that verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^113YmVVT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of amlodipine and atorvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship with drug exposure.

- **Amlodipine**:
	- The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In the postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with the use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine.
	- Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.

- **Atorvastatin**:
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Pancreatitis.
	- **General disorders**: Fatigue.
	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure.
	- **Immune system disorders**: Anaphylaxis.
	- **Injury**: Tendon rupture.
	- **Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders**: Rhabdomyolysis, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use.
	- **Nervous system disorders**: Dizziness, peripheral neuropathy. There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia).

### Severe beta blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose: Role of high dose insulin [^116cCdtD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). High credibility.

A 54-year-old female presented after taking an overdose of an unknown amount of hydrochlorothiazide, doxazosin, atenolol, and amlodipine. She was initially refractory to treatment with conventional therapy: intravenous fluids, activated charcoal, glucagon 5 mg followed with glucagon drip, calcium gluconate 10%, and atropine. Furthermore, insulin at 4 U/kg was not effective in improving her hemodynamics. Shortly following a high dose insulin at 10 U/kg was administered, there was a dramatic improvement in her hemodynamics, resulting in three of five vasopressors being weaned off within 8 hours. She was subsequently off all vasopressors after six additional hours.

The role of high dose insulin has been documented in prior cases; however, it is generally recommended after other conventional therapies have failed. There are other reports suggesting its use as an initial therapy. Our patient failed conventional therapies and responded well only with the maximum dose of insulin. Physicians should consider high dose insulin early in cases of severe beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose for improvement in hemodynamics, leading to early discontinuation of vasopressors. It is important for emergency physicians to be aware of the beneficial effects of high dose insulin when initiated early, as opposed to waiting for conventional therapy to fail, since these patients often present first to the emergency department. Early initiation in the emergency department can be beneficial.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^111e8MLq]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for calcium channel blocker toxicity, with specific emphasis on temporary cardiac pacing, the AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend considering the placement of a pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism in patients with CCB poisoning that is refractory to first-line treatments.

### Is the intra-aortic balloon pump a method of brain protection during cardiogenic shock after drug intoxication [^114ZbW2D]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular medications are ubiquitous and frequently implicated in accidental or intentional overdose. Combined use of these drugs may lead to hypotension and even shock, followed by metabolic derangements. We report a case where an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used in managing self-poisoning with verapamil, amlodipine, metoprolol, and ibuprofen.

In presenting this case of combined massive drug ingestion, we outline an early strategy in the Emergency Department and some alternative treatment options. Beyond pharmacological and conservative procedures, we implemented an invasive approach that included temporary pacing, mechanical ventilation, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). Such intense treatment was necessary due to the critical state of the patient.

In our opinion, the use of the IABP contributed to the final recovery of our adolescent patient. Combined mechanical and pharmacological treatment may protect from multi-organ insufficiency, including permanent central nervous system injury. It is hoped that reporting our experience will raise awareness of alternative treatment options for ingestions of cardiovascular medications.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiac arrest, more specifically concerning patients with calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose, the 2017 guidelines from the AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM recommend administering the following in addition to standard advanced cardiac life support for patients with CCB poisoning in cardiac arrest:

- **IV calcium**: Even if previously administered.
- **Lipid-emulsion therapy**: If not administered previously.

### Amlodipine poisoning complicated with acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [^115zFn2y]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Amlodipine poisoning is an uncommon presentation with potentially life-threatening complications. As there are few cases of severe poisoning documented, management guidelines are limited. The authors present the case of a 22-year-old female who presented to the hospital 6 hours after ingesting 280 mg of amlodipine. She was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and a calcium gluconate infusion. She went on to develop acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, for which she needed a frusemide infusion. She stayed in the hospital for 5 days and was discharged following a psychiatric review with no long-term complications. The authors discuss other management options available for patients presenting with amlodipine overdose.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^111SfAGp]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

These recommendations aim to improve the management of CCB poisoning and address which types of in-hospital interventions should be considered for adults with a potentially toxic ingestion of CCB. In addition to these recommendations, the workgroup emphasizes the important role of poison centers. The workgroup, as detailed in Appendix 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 1), was created to develop an analytical framework illustrating the links between key questions (KQ) to be answered.

- **Key questions (KQ)**:
	1. Is there direct evidence that one or more interventions reduce mortality (critical outcome), improve functional outcomes, reduce hospital length of stay (LOS), or reduce ICU LOS (important outcomes)?
	2. Does the patient clinical presentation or type of ingestion influence the interventions provided and the outcomes?
	3. Does one or more interventions decrease CCB serum concentration, improve hemodynamics, or reduce the duration of vasopressor use?
	4. Are the intermediate outcomes reliably associated with reduced mortality or improved functional outcomes?
	5. Does one or more interventions result in adverse effects or demonstrate a lack of cost-effectiveness?

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrument provided the basis for the development of these guidelines.

### Doptelet [^114oK4Az]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the event of overdose, platelet count may increase excessively and result in thrombotic or thromboembolic complications. Closely monitor the patient and platelet count. Treat thrombotic complications in accordance with standard of care. No antidote for Doptelet overdose is known. Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of Doptelet because Doptelet is only approximately 6% renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116UApcQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Therapy in asymptomatic patients**: For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of calcium channel blockers (CCB), the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT). Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison up to one hour previously. The potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded.

- **Rationale**: Based on case series, it is preferable to observe and monitor asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose, in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours, to consider gastrointestinal decontamination, and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for, and types of, decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

- **First-line therapy for symptomatic patients**: For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends the use of IV calcium, high-dose insulin therapy with other first-line treatments if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present, and norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the presence of shock, even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed.

### Mulpleta [^117LPWck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: No antidote for Mulpleta overdose is known. In the event of an overdose, platelet count may increase excessively and result in thrombotic or thromboembolic complications. Closely monitor the patient and platelet count. Treat thrombotic complications in accordance with standard care.

Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of Mulpleta because lusutrombopag is highly bound to protein in plasma.

### Calcium channel blocker overdose mimicking an acute myocardial infarction [^111mdnLR]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, weakness, and diaphoresis, and developed a new left bundle branch block while under evaluation in the Emergency Department. During emergency cardiac catheterization, he was found to have only insignificant coronary disease and a hyperdynamic ventricle. Despite these findings, he subsequently developed profound bradycardia and hypotension, which were refractory to standard therapies, including pressors, calcium, and transvenous pacing. He gradually improved over several days and made a full recovery, after which he admitted to taking multiple calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in an attempt to self-medicate for symptoms he related to his lifelong paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. This is the first report of a CCB overdose mimicking an acute myocardial infarction and highlights the fact that CCB overdose must be considered in the differential diagnosis of some patients who present with apparent acute myocardial infarction.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1133KeJc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treat all verapamil overdoses as serious and maintain observation for at least 48 hours (especially Verapamil Hydrochloride Tablets SR), preferably under continuous hospital care. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with the sustained-release formulation. Verapamil is known to decrease gastrointestinal transit time.

Treatment of overdosage should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solutions may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used effectively in the treatment of deliberate overdosage with verapamil. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers has been associated with hypotension and bradycardia, initially refractory to atropine but becoming more responsive to this treatment when the patients received large doses (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride.

Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high-degree AV block should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Outcomes of unintentional beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker overdoses: A retrospective review of poison center data [^1115TJpd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Outcomes following unintentional, supratherapeutic ingestions of a patient's own beta-blocker (BB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB) have not been well studied. A retrospective review of all poison control center (PCC) charts from January 2007 through December 2009 yielded 4,099 cases involving a BB or CCB; of these, 436 (10.6%) met inclusion criteria. Data abstracted included patient age/gender, medication(s) involved, dose(s), time interval between ingestions, symptoms, and outcome. Exclusion criteria included intentional ingestions, ingesting someone else's medication, and ingestion intervals greater than 12 hours.

Outcomes were defined as the development of symptoms, management site, hospital admission, and death. The mean age was 65.1 years (range 2–91; SD 17.9); 284 (65.1%) were women. Eighty-two (18.8%) cases resulted in emergency department (ED) evaluation, with 44 (53.7%) of these referred by the PCC. Symptoms developed in 44 (10.1%) cases, and 32 (7.3%) were admitted due to the ingestion. Of those admitted, five (15.6%) received treatment: three with intravenous fluids, one with glucagon, and one with calcium.

Of the 343 (78.7%) cases initially observed on-site, three (0.9%) were later referred to an ED; none required treatment. There was one death under extenuating circumstances. The validity of data abstraction was determined for six variables using 43 charts, with an agreement of 0.97 [95% CI (0.91–0.99)]. Based on a retrospective analysis of PCC cases, home observation of asymptomatic patients following unintentional supratherapeutic ingestions of their own BB or CCB was safe in most cases. Further prospective study is required to identify additional factors.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^116oPAnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of telmisartan or amlodipine. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, hence it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to telmisartan or amlodipine.

- **General and neurological reactions**: headache, dizziness, asthenia, fatigue, weakness, syncope

- **Respiratory and gastrointestinal reactions**: coughing, nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal pain

- **Cardiovascular reactions**: chest pain, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, increased blood pressure, aggravated hypertension, hypotension (including postural hypotension), bradycardia

- **Metabolic and electrolyte reactions**: hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia (in diabetic patients), increased uric acid levels

- **Dermatological and hypersensitivity reactions**: edema (including face, lower limb edema, angioneurotic edema), urticaria, hypersensitivity, increased sweating, erythema, anaphylactic reaction, drug eruption (e.g. toxic skin eruption mostly reported as toxicoderma, rash, and urticaria), angioedema (which can be fatal)

- **Musculoskeletal reactions**: pain, back pain, muscle cramps (including leg cramps), myalgia, tendon pain (including tendonitis, tenosynovitis)

- **Hematological and biochemical reactions**: eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased CPK

- **Renal and hepatic reactions**: abnormal hepatic function/liver disorder, renal impairment including acute renal failure

- **Additional reactions**: edema, urinary tract infection, erectile dysfunction
