## Question

can gallstones cause right flank pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gallstones can cause right flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic pain pattern of biliary colic and where it typically localizes. Then, I I should verify documented radiation patterns and whether the right flank specifically appears in guideline or society criteria. Next, I will consider the neuroanatomy and pathophysiology to see if flank referral is plausible. After that, I should evaluate gallstone complications that might present with flank or back pain. I also need to differentiate biliary pain from the far more common nephrolithiasis-related flank pain, and finally, I will review the recommended diagnostic pathway and synthesize a conclusion with clinical implications [^112ZUeFZ] [^1115ZyaN] [^114sk6Tz].

> Let me first confirm the typical presentation of biliary colic. The cardinal description is severe visceral pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium lasting at least 15–30 minutes and often hours, sometimes postprandial and responsive to analgesics, which aligns with high-credibility hepatology and primary care guidance [^112ZUeFZ] [^1115ZyaN]. Wait, let me verify the quality descriptor: although it is commonly called "colic", biliary colic is usually steady rather than truly cramping or intermittently colicky, so I should correct that initial phrasing to "steady, severe visceral pain" sustained over time rather than waxing and waning spasms [^112n3CtX] [^112ZUeFZ].

> Next, I should review radiation patterns carefully. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines explicitly mention posterior radiation. EASL describes radiation to the right back or shoulder during typical attacks, and radiology reviews also note radiation to the back and right shoulder tip, which supports posterior and posterosuperior referral from gallbladder pain [^112ZUeFZ] [^112FiUEo]. I need to ensure whether "right flank" is encompassed by these descriptions; anatomically the flank lies in the lateral/posterolateral trunk, which is part of the posterior region, so posterior radiation to the "back" plausibly includes the right flank region in many patients [^112ZUeFZ].

> I should double-check if there is direct mention of right flank radiation in formal criteria. The British Journal of Surgery synthesis quotes the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract criteria including temporary epigastric or upper right abdominal pain with radiation to the right flank or back, which directly names the right flank as a recognized radiation site in symptomatic cholelithiasis, and that addresses the question head-on [^113DjeRR].

> Let me consider the mechanistic plausibility next. Visceral afferents from the gallbladder travel via the celiac plexus to thoracic spinal segments that overlap with somatic dermatomes supplying the right posterior trunk, making referred pain to the back and flank neuroanatomically consistent, while diaphragmatic peritoneal irritation explains right shoulder referral through the phrenic nerve; even if the exact segmental mapping is not detailed in a single guideline here, the pattern of posterior and shoulder radiation reported by EASL and radiology sources fits this convergence model [^112ZUeFZ] [^112RkMn4]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while the neuroanatomy supports it, the clinical evidence base still needs to guide how commonly flank radiation occurs, which appears to be less frequent than classic RUQ localization but nonetheless documented [^112ZUeFZ] [^113DjeRR].

> I will now examine whether specific gallstone complications make flank or back pain more prominent. Choledocholithiasis appears explicitly in comprehensive differentials for acute flank pain, indicating that biliary pathology can present in flank-dominant patterns, especially when retroperitoneal irritation or ductal obstruction supervenes, and gallstone pancreatitis often presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back due to pancreatic retroperitoneal involvement, which can be perceived as flank pain in some patients [^114Hh4Ji] [^116iJ9kQ]. I need to check inflammatory scenarios as well; acute cholecystitis produces prolonged RUQ pain and can cause more constant, severe pain with posterior radiation, although RUQ localization remains typical and should be elicited on exam with Murphy's sign when present [^114LvVvZ] [^112ZUeFZ].

> But wait, what if we are actually dealing with the much more common renal colic? I should confirm distinguishing features. Renal colic classically centers at the costovertebral angle and lateral flank, often with hematuria or urinary symptoms, whereas biliary pain anchors in the RUQ or epigastrium and may be postprandial with nausea and a positive Murphy's sign, so history and exam cues are essential to avoid misattribution [^111kMaDx] [^112ZUeFZ]. Hold on, I should verify imaging pathways that reflect these differences; noncontrast CT is the recommended confirmation test for suspected nephrolithiasis after an initial ultrasound in acute flank pain, whereas ultrasound is the first-line test for suspected biliary disease with RUQ pain, which also helps triage equivocal cases that straddle both differentials [^114sk6Tz] [^1115ZyaN].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach when right flank pain raises both renal and biliary possibilities. For suspected biliary pathology, abdominal ultrasound is first-line, and if negative but clinical suspicion persists for ductal stones, MRCP or EUS is recommended to evaluate the biliary tree; for suspected nephrolithiasis, unenhanced CT has very high sensitivity and is often obtained for acute flank pain, with ultrasound as an initial option in selected groups such as pregnancy or to reduce radiation exposure, and CT frequently reveals alternative diagnoses including biliary disease when renal stones are absent, which is helpful in atypical flank presentations [^1115ZyaN] [^114gZRhV] [^114sk6Tz]. Let me also note, I should confirm that coexistence of biliary and urologic pathology can occur; case literature demonstrates dual pathologies and underscores the need to image methodically when the clinical picture is mixed or recurrent [^111KKYBR].

> I should synthesize this now. Yes, gallstones can cause right flank pain, although it is less common than classic RUQ or epigastric pain; this is supported by guideline descriptions of posterior radiation, direct inclusion of right flank radiation in surgical society criteria, and the mechanistically consistent pattern of referred visceral pain, with certain complications like choledocholithiasis and gallstone pancreatitis further increasing the likelihood of back or flank-dominant pain presentations [^112ZUeFZ] [^113DjeRR] [^112FiUEo] [^116iJ9kQ]. I need to ensure we keep perspective; renal colic remains the leading cause of acute right flank pain, so biliary causes should be considered alongside urologic etiologies and adjudicated with appropriate imaging and clinical correlation rather than assumed upfront [^111kMaDx] [^114sk6Tz].

> Clinically, I should confirm that when right flank pain includes RUQ or epigastric components, postprandial triggers, nausea, or a positive Murphy's sign, biliary evaluation with ultrasound is appropriate, and if renal imaging is negative in a flank-predominant presentation, hepatobiliary causes deserve renewed consideration with MRCP or EUS as needed to rule out ductal stones, while reserving CT primarily when the renal differential remains prominent or complications are suspected [^1115ZyaN] [^114gZRhV] [^114sk6Tz]. Let me reconsider analgesia briefly; NSAIDs are guideline-supported for biliary colic while definitive management depends on the underlying diagnosis and severity, but the immediate priority is accurate differentiation so that therapy is directed appropriately rather than delayed by diagnostic anchoring on a single system [^111kF8FT] [^112ZUeFZ].

Yes, gallstones can cause **right flank pain**, but this is **uncommon** and usually reflects radiation from the right upper quadrant or epigastrium to the right flank or back [^112ZUeFZ] [^112FiUEo]. The classic presentation is biliary colic or cholecystitis with RUQ or epigastric pain radiating to the back or right shoulder; **isolated right flank pain** should prompt evaluation for renal or musculoskeletal causes [^112ZUeFZ] [^112FiUEo]. Ultrasound is the **first-line test** for suspected gallstones, whereas non-contrast CT is preferred for suspected nephrolithiasis [^111kMaDx] [^1115ZyaN].

## Typical pain patterns in gallstone disease

Gallstone disease typically presents with **characteristic pain patterns**:

- **Biliary colic**: Intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone causes severe, cramping RUQ or epigastric pain that typically radiates to the back or right shoulder; the pain is usually temporary and subsides when obstruction resolves [^112FiUEo].

- **Acute cholecystitis**: Persistent cystic duct obstruction with gallbladder inflammation causes constant RUQ pain, often with radiation to the back or right shoulder, and is associated with fever, nausea, and vomiting [^112FiUEo].

- **Choledocholithiasis**: Stones in the common bile duct cause RUQ pain, jaundice, and sometimes pancreatitis or cholangitis [^113hsghK].

---

## Mechanisms of right flank pain in gallstone disease

Right flank pain in gallstone disease is **uncommon** but may occur via radiation or referral, as biliary colic or cholecystitis can extend to the right flank or back due to shared neural pathways and **referred pain** patterns [^112ZUeFZ]. Complications involving adjacent structures — such as Mirizzi syndrome, gallstone ileus, or pancreatitis — may affect nearby organs and produce pain that extends to the flank or back [^112FiUEo]. Additionally, post-cholecystectomy syndrome with persistent or recurrent pain — sometimes from retained stones or biliary dyskinesia — may present as right flank pain.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting gallstones as a cause of right flank pain

Clinical guidelines and studies support that gallstone-related pain can involve the right flank. The EASL guidelines describe episodic severe RUQ or epigastric pain often radiating to the right back or shoulder [^112ZUeFZ], and the SECURE trial defines symptomatic gallstone disease as severe epigastric or RUQ pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, often **radiating to the back** [^116KhQ8g]. Rare case reports also describe presentations primarily as right flank pain, particularly in the setting of complications or atypical features.

---

## Diagnostic approach to right flank pain suspected to be caused by gallstones

When assessing right flank pain potentially related to gallstones, use a systematic approach that begins with clinical history and physical examination to identify characteristic biliary symptoms — episodic severe pain radiating to the back or shoulder, with associated nausea or vomiting [^112ZUeFZ]. Order laboratory tests, including liver function tests, bilirubin, and inflammatory markers, to evaluate for biliary obstruction or inflammation. For imaging, select **abdominal ultrasound** as the initial modality due to its high sensitivity and specificity for gallstones and related complications [^1115ZyaN], and consider MRI with MRCP or contrast-enhanced CT if ultrasound is inconclusive or complications are suspected [^1124zXSb].

---

## Differential diagnosis of right flank pain

Right flank pain has a **broad differential**, including:

- **Renal causes**: Nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, renal colic.

- **Musculoskeletal causes**: Muscle strain, rib fractures, spinal disorders.

- **Gastrointestinal causes**: Appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis.

- **Other causes**: Herpes zoster, retroperitoneal fibrosis, adrenal disorders.

---

## Management of gallstone-related right flank pain

Management of gallstone-related right flank pain **depends on severity** and the presence of complications:

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs are recommended for pain relief in uncomplicated biliary colic or acute cholecystitis [^1129skaj].

- **Surgical intervention**: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones or complicated gallstone disease [^1111CP8n].

- **Endoscopic procedures**: ERCP with stone extraction is indicated for choledocholithiasis or retained common bile duct stones [^112nT7i9].

---

Gallstones can cause **right flank pain**, typically via radiation from the RUQ or epigastrium and, less commonly, through complications involving adjacent structures. A systematic diagnostic approach — clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging — is essential to differentiate gallstone-related pain from other causes of right flank pain.

The broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease can be broken down based on the anatomical locations in which they occur (Fig. 8). Figure 8 illustrates the multitude of locations within the digestive tract where gallstones can manifest and lists the pathological processes that occur in these locations.

- **Gallbladder**: Unsurprisingly, the most common location for gallstones and thus gallstone-related disease is the gallbladder. Biliary colic is caused when a stone temporarily obstructs the drainage from the cystic duct, resulting in severe cramping abdominal and right upper quadrant pain that can radiate to the back and right shoulder tip as the gallbladder contracts. Typically, these symptoms are temporary and subside with resolution of the cystic duct obstruction. Ultrasonography will often demonstrate cholelithiasis without associated complications in patients with simple biliary colic.

	- Calculous cholecystitis refers to infection and inflammation of the gallbladder wall caused by irritation from gallstones, and this can be an acute or chronic process. The typical clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis is of right upper quadrant pain, with or without radiation to the right shoulder, which is more constant compared to the intermittent pain seen in biliary colic. There is usually associated pyrexia and other infective symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The typical imaging features of acute cholecystitis are as follows: gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a distended gallbladder (Figs. 9 and 10).

### Laparoscopic ureterolysis and reconstruction of a retrocaval ureter [^111KKYBR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old man was investigated for repeated episodes of right-sided flank pain. Ultrasonography showed a dilated right pelvicalyceal system and upper ureter, as well as multiple gallstones. Subsequent intravenous urogram demonstrated a retrocaval ureter. At surgery, a right-sided double-J ureteric stent was placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Initially, three laparoscopic ports were used. The dilated pelvis and upper ureter were mobilized, followed by the lower ureter. The pelvis was transected and transposed anterior to the inferior vena cava. Reconstruction was carried out with an intracorporeally sutured anastomosis over the double-J stent. A fourth port was added for completion of cholecystectomy. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the third day. Fourteen months later, he remains well, with a recent intravenous urogram showing regression of hydronephrosis. We review the previously reported cases of laparoscopic and retroperitoneoscopic reconstruction of retrocaval ureter to compare and contrast these minimal access approaches.

### A large choledochocystolithiasis mimicking Mirizzi syndrome [^111d4k9G]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old man presented with spontaneous severe epigastric pain, which was progressing and radiating to his back for the past three days. This was associated with epigastric tenderness, bilious vomiting, and jaundice. He had been intermittently experiencing these symptoms for the last year. There were no known comorbidities. An ultrasound showed a poorly visualized heterogeneous focus at the porta hepatis; given the poor visualization, this might represent an enlarged calcified lymph node, a cystic duct calculus causing extrinsic compression, or a large sludge ball within the common bile duct (CBD), leading to dilatation of the common hepatic duct and intrahepatic biliary system. Subsequent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a focal saccular dilatation of the middle part of the CBD, identified as a type I-B choledochal cyst, with a large heterogeneous focus seen within it representing choledochocystolithiasis. Later, a CT scan was performed for further characterization of the surrounding anatomy and pathology, which confused the appearance of choledochocystolithiasis for Mirizzi syndrome. Surgery and histopathology later confirmed type I-B choledochocystolithiasis and chronic cholecystitis.

Alternative therapies are considered for patients presenting with gallstones.

- **Watchful waiting**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis.

	- Mortality rates for cholecystectomy in the U.S. are derived from the National Halothane Study (JAMA 1966; 197:775–8), which reviewed 27,600 cholecystectomies. Women in good health or with only moderate systemic disease who are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate at 0.054 deaths per 1,000 operations; men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

A young, healthy woman presented to the emergency department multiple times with right upper quadrant pain and subjective fevers for over a year after her laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient required multiple hospital visits and extensive work-ups before finally being diagnosed with retained gallstones in her abdomen. After surgical removal of the stones, her symptoms resolved completely. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing retained gallstones, the substantial burdens they can impose on patients, and the importance of prevention and thorough documentation.

### Vomiting gallstones as a presenting feature of small bowel obstruction secondary to inflammatory stricture [^1148SsTM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with symptoms caused by gallstones are common on a surgical take. Understanding the different ways in which this common condition can present is important to enable the correct diagnosis and thus management plan. The immediate management of gallstones depends on the presenting features and can range from analgesia to surgical intervention. Obstructive cases require intervention, either by ERCP or surgery; the non-obstructive cases are usually left to settle before an elective operation at a later date.

In surgery, the presence of a clinical sign where it 'should not be' can be a sign of another underlying pathology, and this is the embodiment of surgery — to assimilate seemingly disparate pieces of information and act in a way to treat the cause. This case study highlights a rare presentation of one disease state, in vomiting of gallstones, that raised the diagnosis of another pathology, a small bowel obstruction.

### Gallbladder agenesis with midgut malrotation [^111tmQ6Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old female presented with a 4-year history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain. Clinical examination and ultrasound suggested a diagnosis of cholelithiasis, and the patient was eventually booked for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have gallbladder agenesis and small bowel malrotation, with the duodenojejunal flexure to the right of the midline. The gallbladder fossa was filled with fibrous tissue. Both gallbladder agenesis and midgut malrotation are rare congenital abnormalities. Gallbladder agenesis has a similar presentation to more common gallbladder pathologies, such as cholecystitis.

This case illustrates the limitations of, and our over-reliance on, radiological imaging. Moreover, it highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for gallbladder agenesis when ultrasound results are inconclusive. Further investigations and imaging with modalities such as MRI should be used to reduce the risks associated with unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for investigating patients with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. Several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, many pitfalls may confound a correct diagnosis. Some common pitfalls, along with methods to avoid them, will be discussed. A review of common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### A case of flank pain caused by ureteral intussusception accompanied with ureteral polyp [^115Frebg]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of vague pain in the right flank and suprapubic region, along with intermittent haematuria. He recalled experiencing similar mild attacks periodically 2 years earlier, which remitted without treatment. The patient denied any significant medical history, smoking habits, or exposure to solvents or chemicals. Bladder neoplasm was initially suspected based on outpatient color Doppler ultrasonography and cystoscopy at a local hospital 3 days prior to admission. Upon admission, no abnormalities were found in the physical examination, serological examination, and urine cytology.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enlargement in the inferior part of the right ureter with a suspected solid mass (Fig. 1a). Further examination using an intravenous urogram (IVU) showed a "sponge-like" filling defect in the right lower enlarged ureteral lumen and the right ureteral orifice inside the bladder, without any dilation of the upper urinary tract and renal pelvis (Fig. 1b). A ureteral tumor was detected preoperatively.

### Gallstone pancreatitis secondary to a pathological cystic duct stump in a setting of chronic pain syndrome: A diagnostic dilemma [^111WjUrv]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain. She was a patient with chronic pain syndrome and had visited the emergency department several times over the past year. She did not drink alcohol. She had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis 4 years ago. Her lipase was 2020 with normal bilirubin levels. MR cholangiopancreatography revealed a cystic structure resembling a gallbladder in the gallbladder fossa, connected to the biliary system. This structure also contained stones. A review of the histology confirmed that the gallbladder had been removed. She proceeded to have a laparoscopic re-cholecystectomy and made an unremarkable recovery.

### The efficacy of intravenous lidocaine and its side effects in comparison with intravenous morphine sulfate in patients admitted to the ED with right upper abdominal pain suspected of biliary colic [^117TZcjU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Intravenous (IV) lidocaine can be used as an analgesic in acute pain management in the emergency department (ED). This study evaluates the efficacy of IV lidocaine compared to IV morphine in acute pain management in the ED.

- **Method**: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial on adult patients (18–64 years) with right upper abdominal pain suspected of biliary colic who needed pain management. Participants randomly received IV lidocaine (5 cc = 100 mg) or morphine sulfate (5 cc = 5 mg). In both groups, patients' pain scores were recorded and assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes after drug administration. Adverse side effects of lidocaine and morphine sulfate and changes in vital signs were also recorded and compared.

- **Results**: A total of 104 patients were enrolled in the study, including 49 men and 55 women. IV lidocaine reduced pain in less time compared to morphine sulfate. The mean (± SD) baseline pain score was 8.23 (± 1.76) in the lidocaine group and 8.73 (± 0.96) in the morphine group. Patients' mean (± SD) pain scores in both groups did not significantly differ during the study except at NRS2 (10 minutes after drug administration), which was 5.05 (± 2.69) in the lidocaine group compared with 6.39 (± 2.06) in the morphine group, and NRS4 (30 minutes after drug administration), which was significantly lower (P-value = 0.01) in the morphine group [3.84 (± 1.73) vs 4.41 (± 2.82)]. Only 9 patients experienced adverse effects in either group.

- **Conclusion**: The findings of this study suggest that IV lidocaine can be a good choice in pain management for patients admitted to the ED with right upper abdominal pain suspected of biliary colic.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^113KcCn9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an unenhanced CT as the follow-up imaging for symptoms of stone disease in patients with acute-onset flank pain with known stone disease diagnosed on recent imaging. Additionally, consider obtaining a color Doppler ultrasound or a contrast-enhanced CT in these patients.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. While urolithiasis is the most frequent cause, many other entities can present similarly. In many institutions, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is employed in this setting. One major advantage of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies beyond stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

First, the included studies have drawn on different patient sources, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) patients with acute biliary presentation identified via multiple records, (ii) patients who have undergone ERCP or EUS identified from the endoscopic database, and (iii) patients with certain clinical diagnoses such as pancreatitis. It is conceivable that patients from different sources may have different underlying characteristics, with perhaps the most important example being possible higher pretest probabilities for CBDS when patients were drawn from the ERCP database. However, we argue that this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the meta-analysis because sensitivity and specificity, the two measures we have focused on, are intrinsic to the guidelines and are prevalence-invariant.

Moreover, although there is between-study heterogeneity, particularly with respect to the ASGE 2010 guidelines, our sensitivity analysis suggests the impact is small in magnitude. For instance, in the worst case of ASGE 2010, its AUC has changed from 0.65 to 0.71 only after excluding outliers. Second, we have opted to test the guideline similarity using the likelihood ratio test because included studies are shared between the guidelines, making the data dependent. Although this test has indicated that the guidelines are dissimilar, we would like to note that (i) likelihood testing is inherently anticonservative and may overstate the dissimilarities, and (ii) the absolute differences in AUCs between the guidelines, even if they exist.

### Choledocholithiasis: Evaluation, treatment, and outcomes [^113hsghK]. Seminars in Interventional Radiology (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on choledocholithiasis:

- **Definition**: Choledocholithiasis is the presence of stones within the common bile duct, characterized by right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and vomiting.

- **Pathophysiology**: Choledocholithiasis is caused by biliary stones, which can be divided into cholesterol (> 70% cholesterol), mixed (30–70% cholesterol), and pigmented (< 30% cholesterol) stones.

- **Disease course**: Choledocholithiasis causes clinical manifestations of RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Disease complications include jaundice, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholangitis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Percutaneous biliary stone procedures in choledocholithiasis are associated with a mortality rate of 1.4%.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nrvi1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in the English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered. However, we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed a meta-analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESG.

### Surgical approach to a left-sided gallbladder [^115hVbbx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Biliary colic is characterized by pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, thought to be caused by functional gallbladder spasms due to a temporarily obstructing stone in the gallbladder neck, cystic duct, or common bile duct. A 56-year-old man presented with frequent episodes of typical biliary colic. At initial laparoscopy, the gallbladder was absent from its anatomical location. Further inspection revealed a left-sided gallbladder (LSGB), suspended from liver segment 3.

Preoperative ultrasound — the most common imaging modality for symptomatic gallstones — has a low positive predictive value for detecting LSGB (2.7%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was delayed to obtain additional imaging. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated the gallbladder positioned left of the falciform ligament, with the cystic duct entering the common hepatic duct from the left. The patient underwent an elective LC 8 weeks later. The critical view of safety is paramount for safe surgical dissection and could be safely achieved for an LSGB.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only individuals with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones, such as steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen, or complications like acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis, warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported.

Patients experiencing longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once diagnosed, having a cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce hospital stay.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115N5s7N]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

This variation in criteria for surgery was one of the reasons for initiating the SECURE trial, which tested one set of symptom criteria. The study randomized patients with gallstones and abdominal pain between usual care (diagnostics and treatment based on hospital standard care) and a restrictive strategy. In the restrictive arm of the study, cholecystectomy was advised only for patients who had all five prespecified symptoms based on the Rome III criteria and on predictors identified during a previous clinical study: severe pain in attacks, pain in the upper right quadrant or epigastrium, pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, pain radiating to the back, and a positive response to simple analgesics. The primary aim of the SECURE trial was to assess the percentage of patients who were pain-free after one year of follow-up. The trial demonstrated a 7 percent higher cholecystectomy rate in the usual-care arm (75 percent of 537 patients) compared with the restrictive arm (68 percent of 530 patients) (P = 0.005). Despite more cholecystectomies, the usual-care strategy resulted in more patients who were pain-free after 12 months of follow-up (60 versus 56 percent respectively; P = 0.316). Rates of gallstone-related complications were similar in the two groups: 8 percent in the usual-care and 7 percent in the restrictive arm (P = 0.155). The SECURE trial also illustrated the limited validity of Rome III criteria regarding the indication for cholecystectomy in patients with cholecystolithiasis; 35 percent of patients…

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: Etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^111bo4Q4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) emergencies include an ample range of conditions with overlapping clinical presentations and diverse therapeutic options. The most common etiologies are related to cholelithiasis — acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis — and non-traumatic injuries, such as common bile duct or duodenal injuries. Although the true incidence of HPB emergencies is difficult to determine due to selection and reporting biases, a population-based report showed a decline in the global incidence of all severe complications of cholelithiasis, primarily based on a reduction in acute cholecystitis.

Even though patients may present with overlapping symptoms, treatment options can be varied. The treatment of these conditions continues to evolve, and patients may require endoscopic, surgical, and/or percutaneous techniques. Thus, it is essential that a multidisciplinary team of HPB surgeons, interventional gastroenterologists, and radiologists are available on an as-needed basis to the Acute Care Surgeon. This focused manuscript is a contemporary review of the literature surrounding HPB emergencies in the context of the acute care surgeon. The main aim of this review is to offer an update on the diagnosis and management of HPB issues in the acute care setting to improve the care of patients with potential HPB emergencies.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^112RkMn4]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple imaging modalities play a role in the diagnosis of the broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease, including plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Ultrasound is by far the most common and useful imaging modality in assessing gallstones within the gallbladder (cholelithiasis) and associated gallbladder pathology. It has the added benefit of no radiation dose to the patient. With ultrasound, gallstones are characteristically echogenic and demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing regardless of the gallstone composition (see Fig. 1). As ultrasound is a bedside dynamic study, stone mobility can be demonstrated with patient maneuvering, which can help in differentiating gallstones from gallbladder polyps, which can mimic cholelithiasis sonographically.

- **Fig. 1: Sagittal ultrasound image of the gallbladder**: This image demonstrates the typical appearance of a gallstone that is hyperechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing (arrow).

Another principal advantage of ultrasound over other imaging techniques in the investigation of acute cholecystitis is the ability to evaluate for a sonographic Murphy's sign. This can be a reliable indicator of acute cholecystitis with high sensitivity. The sonographic Murphy's sign occurs when the patient reports maximal pain as the sonographer presses over the fundus of the distended gallbladder with the ultrasound probe, differing from the clinical Murphy's sign.

The major limitation of ultrasound in the imaging of gallstone-related disease is lack of visualization of structures obscured by bowel gas.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy is associated with practice variation and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. We aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection with usual care to assess (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. We enrolled patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care, where selection for cholecystectomy was left to the discretion of the surgeon, or a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. For the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who fulfilled all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument: 1) severe pain attacks, 2) pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, 3) pain located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, 4) pain radiating to the back, and 5) a positive pain response to simple analgesics. Randomisation was performed using an online program, implemented into a web-based application with blocks of variable sizes, and stratified for centre (academic versus non-academic and a high versus low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were masked to study-arm allocation until after completion of the triage instrument.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant pain is a common clinical presentation but can often be nonspecific. Acute cholecystitis frequently appears as a diagnosis of exclusion. This review addresses the recommended imaging evaluation in typical clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis.

The document aims to clarify the proper use of numerous available imaging procedures commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision involve extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In cases where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113DjeRR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Quality assessment of 14 international guidelines on cholecystolithiasis showed that only five guidelines were suitable for clinical practice, as most recommendations were based on a low level of evidence. For example, the definition of symptomatic gallstone disease and the indication for cholecystectomy are poorly described. Most guidelines advocate cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or biliary colic; however, both conditions are ill-defined.

- **Symptom criteria in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis**: Table 1 summarizes guidelines and criteria sets for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Most guidelines refer to the Rome criteria to define symptomatic gallstone disease: pain in severe attacks, in the epigastrium or upper right quadrant, and lasting 15–30 minutes or longer. The Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland commission guide from 2016 slightly modified these criteria to epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, frequently with radiation to the back, lasting from several minutes to hours, and often occurring during the night. The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract has similar criteria: temporary epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, radiation to the right flank or back, and nausea. The European Association for the Study of the Liver has reported more than 10 criteria. These various symptoms and criteria reported in the guidelines illustrate the lack of consensus among healthcare professionals.

### Imaging of gallstones and complications [^114D1RKd]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Gallbladder pathologies caused by gallstones are commonly encountered in clinical practice, making accurate diagnosis critical for effective patient management. Radiologists play a key role in differentiating these conditions through imaging interpretation, ensuring that appropriate treatment is initiated. The imaging features of gallstone-associated diseases are classified into various categories, such as inflammatory conditions, benign lesions, malignant tumors, and associated complications. A comprehensive understanding of these categories and their radiologic manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of gallbladder pathology. By integrating clinical knowledge with radiologic findings, clinicians and radiologists will be equipped with practical tools to identify and distinguish between different gallstone-causing conditions.

### Symptomatic cholelithiasis of a remnant gallbladder after open cholecystectomy [^115td62r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy, known as postcholecystectomy syndrome, requires a broad differential diagnosis. Pathology of a retained gallbladder remnant is an exceedingly rare etiology of this pain.

- **Case report**: A 49-year-old woman who had previously undergone an open cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with several hours of postprandial RUQ pain and emesis. Liver function tests and lipase were not significantly elevated. RUQ ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure containing a stone with mild prominence of the common bile duct at 7 mm, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed the presence of a remnant gallbladder without common bile duct obstruction. Her pain subsided, she tolerated a diet, and was discharged with a referral for an elective cholecystectomy.

- **Awareness for emergency physicians**: Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department in the United States, and emergency physicians routinely encounter patients with postcholecystectomy syndrome. Emergency physicians should not exclude the possibility of remnant gallbladder pathology, such as symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, in patients presenting with symptoms concerning for biliary colic, even if the patient has undergone previous cholecystectomy.

### Clinical update on acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis: Between certainties and grey areas [^112zhTUw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis affects 10–15% of the general population, and 20–40% of these individuals will develop complications. In most patients, the first presentation of gallstone-related complications is acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), accounting for 10–15% of symptomatic cases. The most widely used guidelines for managing ACC are the Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines. In many respects, the TG align with the recommendations of the WSES. However, there are still some differences between the TG and WSES guidelines. Our review particularly focuses on the grey and controversial areas in the management of ACC and acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP), which remain under-addressed despite the breadth of prior published literature.

### Qfitlia [^114DeQXz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Acute and reGallbladder disease**: Treatment with QFITLIA is associated with an increased occurrence of acute and reGallbladder disease, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. QFITLIA at a fixed dose (including 80 mg once monthly) is not approved or recommended for use. In the 270 patients in the QFITLIA clinical studies who received the fixed dose (non-AT-based dose) once monthly regimen, 17% experienced gallbladder events, and 4% (11 patients) underwent cholecystectomy. In 286 patients who received the AT-DR, 3.8% experienced gallbladder events, and 0.3% (1 patient) underwent cholecystectomy.

All but one of the patients who underwent cholecystectomy resumed QFITLIA after surgery. One patient who started on fixed dosing experienced cholangitis and pancreatitis caused by gallstone disease more than a year after cholecystectomy while receiving AT-DR.

Patients diagnosed with acute or reGallbladder disease most commonly presented with epigastric pain, generalized abdominal pain, indigestion, nausea, and/or vomiting. If gallbladder disease is suspected, appropriate imaging and clinical follow-up are indicated.

Consider alternative treatment for hemophilia in patients with a history of symptomatic gallbladder disease. Consider interruption or discontinuation of QFITLIA if gallbladder disease occurs.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, those who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are often discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other abdominal imaging.

- **Symptoms and complications**: Asymptomatic patients have a low annual risk of symptom development, approximately 2% per year. Once symptoms appear, uncomplicated gallstones usually present as biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. Pain is typically steady, moderate to severe in intensity, located in the epigastrium or the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. Persistent pain coupled with fever or a high white blood cell count may indicate complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, or ascending cholangitis.

- **Imaging and management**: Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging may be necessary. Acute biliary colic management primarily involves pain control using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is typically minimally successful and is reserved for patients unable to undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical procedure of choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, offering a shorter hospital stay.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 percent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. It is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones and without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years.

Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications such as mild acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis. However, they may also increase the occurrence of more severe, possibly life-threatening adverse events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, and cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, and cutaneous manifestations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials.

### Recurrent gallstone ileus: Beware of the faceted stone [^111oLRFi]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old man with gallstone disease was admitted with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. He was treated for cholecystitis with intravenous antibiotics. Two days later, he reported a new onset of left iliac fossa pain, with tenderness and guarding. An abdominal X-ray demonstrated small bowel obstruction; a CT scan revealed an impacted gallstone within the proximal ileum. He was treated for gallstone ileus and underwent an uncomplicated laparotomy, small bowel enterotomy, and removal of a faceted gallstone.

Three months later, the patient re-presented with generalized abdominal pain, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Small bowel obstruction was again demonstrated, with an impacted gallstone within the distal ileum seen on a CT scan. A second laparotomy revealed two further faceted gallstones, which were removed through an enterotomy. The densely adherent gallbladder to the duodenum precluded a surgical repair of the cholecystoduodenal fistula. He made an uneventful recovery and was subsequently discharged home.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^116A2CKz]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

- **Identification of gallstones**: A sagittal ultrasound (Fig. 17a) shows a distended gallbladder with an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck, accompanied by mild wall thickening. An axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen (Fig. 17b) in the same patient also reveals a distended gallbladder with an impacted hyperattenuating stone in the neck. There is subtle associated fat stranding. These findings are consistent with a gallbladder mucocoele. The wall thickening and fat stranding suggest the possibility of empyema.

- **Mirizzi syndrome**: This condition involves a gallstone impacted in the cystic duct or the neck of the gallbladder, leading to extrinsic compression of the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice (Fig. 18). Imaging features include:
	- Maximum intensity projection (MIP) (Fig. 18a)
	- Axial T2-weighted MRCP image of the biliary tree (Fig. 18b)

	- The gallbladder is distended with extensive intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, while the common bile duct remains normal in calibre. These appearances are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome, with a stone in Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct.

- **Imaging techniques**: Both biliary dilatation and the offending gallstone can be detected using ultrasound. However, cross-sectional imaging with MRI or CT, or an ERCP, may be necessary to confirm if the biliary dilatation results from compression due to a gallbladder/cystic duct stone, rather than from a CBD calculus.

- **Pancreaticobiliary system**: Gallstones can migrate outside the gallbladder into the pancreaticobiliary system.

An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-month history of right upper quadrant pain, which worsened over the last three days and was accompanied by fever and chills. On physical examination, he exhibited scleral icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein. The patient was admitted with a suspicion of acute cholangitis and started on antibiotics. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a juxtapapillary diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum, confirmed by a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, along with upstream biliary tract ectasia. These imaging findings led to the diagnosis of Lemmel's syndrome. Considering potential surgical risks, a conservative approach was chosen. The patient had a favorable course and was discharged home.

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously, the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar pain in the abdomen. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

- **Investigations**: History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

- **Diagnosis**: Choledocholithiasis.

- **Management**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### Honeycomb gallbladder: a very rare cause of right upper quadrant pain [^116vbLGZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Honeycomb gallbladder is a rare congenital malformation of the gallbladder. In some cases, it may be asymptomatic, whereas in others, it may lead to symptoms consistent with biliary colic, even in the absence of cholelithiasis. We present the clinical and imaging findings of a case of a 10-year-old boy who was admitted to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a honeycomb gallbladder. Honeycomb gallbladder is safely diagnosed with ultrasonography, which should be part of the investigation of patients with right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^1124zXSb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gallstone disease, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an abdominal MRI (with or without IV contrast) with MRCP, or a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT, in patients with right upper quadrant pain and suspected biliary disease. This recommendation applies in cases where the ultrasound results are negative or equivocal, and there is no presence of fever or leukocytosis.

### An uncommon late complication of appendicitis [^114upu41]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old boy presented with a 2.5-week history of right leg pain and limp. A right flank mass was noted by a parent on the day of presentation. The child's past medical history was remarkable for perforated appendicitis treated with an interval laparoscopic appendectomy 2 years before this presentation. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass with calcifications, suggestive of a retained appendicolith with abscess formation. This case illustrates the importance of considering very late complications of appendicitis in patients presenting with fever and abdominal or flank pain or masses.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YkQDf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

From a patient perspective, the defining symptom of gallstone disease is severe and lasting (i.e. > 30 minutes) abdominal pain. General abdominal symptoms commonly intensify over a period and become regular pain attacks (biliary colic) that may require medical attention.

A recent large prospective study in the UK (n = 8909 participants) showed that 10.8% of people experienced complications 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, as much as 40% of patients may continue to experience pain and abdominal symptoms after surgery. In particular, persistent pain similar to that experienced preoperatively has been reported in about 20% of people after cholecystectomy, and new pain has been reported in up to 14% of people. Based on the 61,000 episodes reported for 2018/19, 6,600 people would have experienced complications from surgery, and 24,400 would continue to experience pain, with a substantial impact on NHS resources and costs.

Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is an umbrella term widely used to describe the range of symptoms patients might experience after surgery. The term persistent post-cholecystectomy symptoms has been suggested as a more accurate description of these symptoms, which include biliary and non-biliary abdominal pain, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Up to 40% of people may experience persistent pain and discomfort, usually described as post-cholecystectomy symptoms. Persistent diarrhoea or constipation are often reported after cholecystectomy, and flatulence may arise as a new symptom.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: a report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not an uncommon disease in an emergency department (ED). It typically manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation to the back and flank region. Isolated left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Initially, with negative findings on an ultrasound, she was misdiagnosed as having possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography showed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collection extending to the left peri-renal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also discussed the clinical pitfalls in this case.

Regarding surgical interventions for gallstone disease, particularly in relation to cholecystectomy and its technical considerations, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy using four ports. Specifically, two of these ports should be at least 10 mm in size, and the other two ports should be at least 5 mm in size.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^116iJ9kQ]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

In rare cases, there can be a retrograde passage of gallstones into the common hepatic duct or the right or left main hepatic ducts. Stones can also form in intrahepatic ducts due to biliary stasis.

If a gallstone passes down the common bile duct and comes to rest at the ampulla of Vater, it may block the drainage of the pancreatic duct, causing back pressure on the pancreatic cells and resulting in gallstone pancreatitis. Patients with this condition present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, with severity ranging from mild to severe. There is significant mortality associated with severe pancreatitis, and critically ill patients should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care monitored environment. While imaging is not usually required or indicated to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, an ultrasound of the gallbladder can confirm or rule out the presence of gallstones. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis is best performed 48 hours after the onset of symptoms to assess for complications of pancreatitis such as peripancreatic collections or pancreatic necrosis.

- **Figure 20**: Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen (a) and axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI of the abdomen (b) in the same patient demonstrating extensive inflammation and oedema of the pancreas secondary to gallstone pancreatitis with a peripancreatic collection (arrow).

In general, larger gallstones are more likely to obstruct higher in the common bile duct, and as such, are more likely to cause obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. Smaller gallstones are more likely to cause pancreatitis as they more freely pass through the ductal system.

### Cholecystocolonic fistula: An incidental intraoperative discovery managed laparoscopically [^113vLBxi]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cholecystoenteric fistula is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, occurring in 3%-5% of patients with cholelithiasis. The symptoms are typically minimal and vague, with either acute or subacute presentations, rarely leading to bowel obstruction, and occasionally manifesting as chronic abdominal pain. In this case, a male patient in his early 30s presented with epigastric and right hypochondrial pain. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with gallstone disease and adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a cholecystocolonic fistula was unexpectedly discovered. The fistula was managed laparoscopically using ENDOLOOP (prelooped chromic catgut ligature) ligation of the fistulous tract. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on the third postoperative day. This case emphasizes the importance of intraoperative vigilance and demonstrates a successful minimally invasive management approach.

Outcome of cholecystectomy and cause of persistent abdominal pain

- **Summary of patient characteristics and symptoms**: Table 2 summarizes patient characteristics and preoperative symptoms in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. The data are based on three clinical trials (SECURE, PERFECT, and SUCCESS), which included patients between 2014 and 2019 in 30 Dutch hospitals.

The PERFECT and SUCCESS trials showed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy effectively resolved biliary colic. However, both trials confirmed that persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy is present in 40 percent of patients. Several causes of persistent abdominal pain after surgery have been identified. The literature suggests that several gastrointestinal symptoms originating from disease etiologies other than gallstones are responsible for the development of postcholecystectomy pain. Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a prevalence of 20–30 and 20 percent respectively in the primary care population. Both are causes of pain with similar pain characteristics. These conditions generally involve similar population groups: mainly middle-aged women who are overweight. These similarities complicate diagnosis of the condition responsible for a patient's complaints and, as a result, potentially lead to abdominal pain being wrongfully attributed to gallstones and therefore influencing the choice of treatment (cholecystectomy).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right upper quadrant pain: 2022 update [^111s74rW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in hospital emergency departments and outpatient settings. While gallstone-related acute cholecystitis is a primary diagnostic consideration, extrabiliary sources such as hepatic, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, and musculoskeletal issues should also be considered. This document focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies specifically targeting acute right upper quadrant pain, primarily due to biliary etiologies including acute cholecystitis and its complications. Additionally, extrabiliary sources like acute pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, hepatitis, and painful liver neoplasms are considered in appropriate clinical contexts. The use of radiographs, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI for these indications is discussed.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision involve comprehensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, applying well-established methodologies such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: Can we differentiate [^111jXPp1]? Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the success of cross-sectional imaging in evaluating hepatopancreatobiliary system malignancies, several non-malignant disease processes may closely mimic malignancy. Differentiating these benign diseases from malignancy may be difficult, or even impossible, even in the hands of experienced imagers. In this manuscript, we present benign mimics involving the hepatopancreatobiliary system and aim to increase awareness of these potential pitfalls.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: Etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^116eKPwD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute inflammation of the gallbladder is a frequent complication of cholelithiasis, affecting up to 20% of patients with symptomatic gallstones. Despite the history that most patients provide (previous episodes of transient colic pain in their right upper quadrant), acute presentations to a healthcare facility are typically longer and associated with additional symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting after ingesting high-fat foods. Obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone or sludge produces dilation of the gallbladder and increases its internal pressure, leading to subsequent biliary stasis and the proliferation of microorganisms.

If the obstruction persists, venous outflow decreases, with dilation of capillaries and lymphatics resulting in gallbladder wall edema and thickening. Eventually, the gallbladder develops areas of hemorrhage and necrosis due to vascular occlusion. Imaging and exploration may reveal both fluid and air within the gallbladder wall. If the ischemia and necrosis are located within the posterior wall (i.e. apposed to the liver), a pericholecystic abscess eroding into the liver commonly occurs.

Specific complications such as perforation, biliary peritonitis, pericholecystic abscess, and biliary fistula (between the gallbladder and duodenum, colon, or stomach) may alter the clinical presentation and increase the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Uncommon complications include Bouveret's syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, biliary ileus, and gallstone-related small bowel obstruction.

**Key points**: Gallstone-related pathology is on the increase in the Western world. Gallstones can be located within the gallbladder, migrate into the biliary tree, or exist outside the pancreaticobiliary system altogether with associated pathology. Imaging of gallstones and associated pathology requires a multimodality approach.

### Emergency biliary sonography: Utility of common bile duct measurement in the diagnosis of cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis [^115nf4f8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of the common bile duct (CBD) has traditionally been considered an integral part of gallbladder sonography, but accurate identification of the CBD can be difficult for novice sonographers.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of isolated sonographic CBD dilation in emergency department (ED) patients with cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis without laboratory abnormalities or other pathologic findings on biliary ultrasound.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review on two separate ED patient cohorts between June 2000 and June 2010. The first cohort comprised all ED patients undergoing a biliary ultrasound and subsequent cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. The second cohort consisted of all ED patients receiving a biliary ultrasound who were ultimately diagnosed with choledocholithiasis. Ultrasound data and contemporaneous laboratory values were collected. Postoperative gallbladder pathology reports and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) reports were used as the criterion standard for final diagnosis.

- **Results**: Of 666 cases of cholecystitis, there were 251 (37.7%) with a dilated CBD > 6 mm and only 2 cases (0.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0–0.7%) of isolated CBD dilation with an otherwise negative ultrasound and normal laboratory values. Of 111 cases of choledocholithiasis, there were 80 (72.0%) with a dilated CBD and only 1 case (0.9%; 95% CI 0.0–2.7%) with an otherwise negative ultrasound and normal laboratory values.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of isolated sonographic CBD dilation in cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis is low.

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^112q6sZS]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Study design and participants**: The design of the SECURE trial study has been reported previously. In brief, the SECURE trial was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study conducted in 24 academic and non-academic centers in the Netherlands. The initial study and 5-year follow-up were approved by the medical ethics commission (METC: 2013–129) and boards of directors of all participating hospitals. All included patients provided written informed consent before participation in the trial. This trial was registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register and conducted according to the ethical standards of the updated Helsinki Declaration of 2013. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines were followed.

Eligible participants were patients aged 18 to 95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones, referred to a surgical outpatient clinic to discuss cholecystectomy. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously reported in the trial protocol and initial study.

- **Randomization and masking**: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive usual care or a restrictive strategy before their first visit at the surgical outpatient clinic. Randomization was stratified by center (academic vs non-academic and high vs low volume), sex, and body mass index. At the first visit, the treating physician completed a digital triage instrument to evaluate whether the included patients fulfilled five prespecified criteria.
