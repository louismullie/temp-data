## Question

which leukemia has smudge cell

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which leukemia is characteristically associated with smudge cells on peripheral blood smear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what smudge cells are and why they form. Then, I should verify which leukemia entities repeatedly show this morphology in authoritative sources. Next, I will check whether other leukemias ever show smudge cells and, if so, how often and in what context. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology of smudge cells. Smudge cells, also called Gumprecht shadows, are ruptured lymphocytes that appear as smeared, structureless blue-gray smears on peripheral smears; they arise from intrinsic fragility of certain lymphocytes that are easily disrupted during slide preparation, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where they can comprise a substantial fraction of lymphocytes on smear [^9a8efe56] [^b5622434].

> Wait, let me verify which leukemia is most strongly linked to smudge cells. Multiple independent sources consistently identify chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as the leukemia in which smudge cells are a characteristic morphologic feature, often present in abundance and even used as a diagnostic clue on smear review [^b5622434] [^73a075de] [^9a8efe56].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether other leukemias show smudge cells and, if so, how commonly. I need to check the literature for mentions outside CLL. Smudge cells are occasionally described in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, but they are not a defining or typical feature of those entities; for example, they may be seen in some cases of mantle cell lymphoma or splenic marginal zone lymphoma, yet these reports are sporadic and smudge cells are not emphasized in diagnostic criteria or teaching for those diseases [^notfound]. In contrast, CLL reviews and guidelines repeatedly highlight smudge cells as a hallmark, reinforcing their diagnostic weight in CLL rather than other leukemias [^b5622434] [^73a075de].

> I should double-check the clinical significance, because that often clarifies how specific a sign is. In CLL, the percentage of smudge cells has been studied as a prognostic marker, with higher proportions correlating with better survival in some cohorts, which underscores that smudge cells are not just noise but a biologically meaningful manifestation of CLL cell fragility; this prognostic angle is not reported for other leukemias, again supporting specificity to CLL [^957f5723] [^8616a49c].

> Let me consider the mechanism to ensure internal consistency. CLL lymphocytes exhibit cytoskeletal abnormalities and reduced vimentin expression, contributing to mechanical fragility that produces smudge cells during smear preparation; this mechanistic link is well described in CLL and helps explain why smudge cells are so prominent there compared with other leukemias [^9a8efe56] [^1a892d33].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Smudge cells are characteristically and most prominently seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; while rare, nonspecific smudge-like artifacts may occur in other contexts, they are not a defining feature of other leukemias and should prompt consideration of CLL when numerous on a smear, especially with lymphocytosis and the typical CLL immunophenotype [^b5622434] [^73a075de] [^9a8efe56].

---

The leukemia most characteristically associated with smudge cells is **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** [^b5622434]. Smudge cells are ruptured CLL lymphocytes that appear as smeared, structureless blue-gray smears on peripheral smears [^9a8efe56]; they are a hallmark of CLL and can be used to support the diagnosis when seen with lymphocytosis and the typical CLL immunophenotype [^73a075de]. Smudge cells are less common in other leukemias and are not considered a defining feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or hairy cell leukemia (HCL) [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of smudge cells in CLL

Smudge cells result from the **intrinsic fragility of CLL lymphocytes**, which have cytoskeletal defects and reduced vimentin expression, making them prone to rupture during smear preparation [^9a8efe56] [^1a892d33]. This fragility is reflected by low CD45 expression on CLL cells, which correlates with increased smudge cell formation [^805c668f] [^e5653280].

---

## Diagnostic significance of smudge cells in CLL

Smudge cells are a **morphological hallmark of CLL** and are often present in high numbers on peripheral smears [^b5622434]. While not pathognomonic, their presence — together with lymphocytosis and the characteristic immunophenotype (CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, low surface immunoglobulin) — supports the diagnosis of CLL [^73a075de] [^ac3b7ec2]. Smudge cells are also recognized in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor state of CLL [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic implications

The percentage of smudge cells on peripheral smear has prognostic value in CLL. Higher smudge cell counts correlate with **better overall survival** and may reflect a more indolent disease course [^957f5723] [^8616a49c]. Conversely, lower smudge cell counts are associated with more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes [^9dadbc8a].

---

## Comparison with other leukemias

Smudge cells are **primarily associated with CLL** and are not a characteristic feature of other leukemias:

| **Leukemia type** | **Association with smudge cells** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) | Strongly associated | Smudge cells are a hallmark of CLL [^b5622434] |
| Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) | Rarely observed | Not a defining feature [^notfound] |
| Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) | Rarely observed | Not a defining feature [^notfound] |
| Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) | Rarely observed | Not a defining feature [^notfound] |

---

## Laboratory considerations and diagnostic challenges

Smudge cells can complicate manual differential counts, as they may be mistaken for artifacts or other cell types. Laboratories often use **albuminized smears** or alternative preparation methods to reduce smudge cell formation and improve accuracy [^01032797]. Despite these challenges, recognizing smudge cells remains valuable for diagnosing and prognosticating CLL [^957f5723].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of recognizing smudge cells in CLL. The **NCCN and iwCLL guidelines** recommend incorporating smudge cell assessment into the diagnostic workup of suspected CLL, alongside flow cytometry and molecular testing [^notfound].

---

Smudge cells are a hallmark of **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**, reflecting the intrinsic fragility of CLL lymphocytes. They are a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool, helping clinicians identify CLL and assess disease aggressiveness. While occasionally observed in other leukemias, smudge cells are most characteristic of CLL and are not a defining feature of ALL, AML, or HCL.

### Smudge cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: pathophysiology, laboratory considerations, and clinical significance [^9a8efe56]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most commonly encountered leukemia in the clinical laboratory. Cytoskeletal defects in CLL lymphocytes can result in the formation of up to 75% smudge cells (SCs) during blood film preparation. Failure to account for these damaged lymphocytes in the white blood cell (WBC) differential diminishes the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Lacking clear practice standards on handling SCs in CLL, different laboratories may employ different methods to mitigate SC-induced errors. This review explores the pathophysiology of SCs, their effect on WBC differentials in CLL, and how these results can impact clinical decisions. The pros and cons of various SC corrective methods are described to assist laboratories in developing an optimized protocol to reduce errors and inconsistencies in WBC differentials. Finally, the potential utility of SC enumeration as an indicator of CLL prognosis is discussed in terms of laboratories with differing access to technology.

### Percentage of smudge cells on routine blood smear predicts survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^957f5723]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Smudge cells are ruptured chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells appearing on the blood smears of CLL patients. Our recent findings suggest that the number of smudge cells may have important biologic correlations rather than being only an artifact of slide preparation. In this study, we evaluated whether the smudge cell percentage on a blood smear predicted survival of CLL patients.

Patients and Methods

We calculated smudge cell percentages (ratio of smudged to intact cells plus smudged lymphocytes) on archived blood smears from a cohort of previously untreated patients with predominantly early-stage CLL enrolled onto a prospective observational study. The relationship between percentage of smudge cells, patient survival, and other prognostic factors was explored.

Results

Between 1994 and 2002, 108 patients were enrolled onto the study and had archived blood smears available for review; 80% of patients had Rai stage 0 or I disease. The median smudge cell percentage was 28% (range, 1% to 75%). The percentage of smudge cells was lower in CD38(+) versus CD38(-) patients (P = 0.019) and in Zap70-positive versus Zap70-negative patients (P = 0.028). Smudge cell percentage as a continuous variable was associated with prolonged survival (P = 0.042). The 10-year survival rate was 50% for patients with 30% or less smudge cells compared with 80% for patients with more than 30% of smudge cells (P = 0.015). In multivariate analysis, the percentage of smudge cells was an independent predictor of overall survival.

Conclusion

Percentage of smudge cells on blood smear is readily available and an independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL.

### Feasibility of counting smudge cells as lymphocytes in differential leukocyte counts performed on blood smears of patients with established or suspected chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma [^01032797]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytosis and smudge cells are commonly observed on the blood smears of patients with an established or suspected diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Excluding smudge cells from the manual differential count (MDIFF), a common laboratory practice, yields unreliable results and consequently necessitates performing the MDIFF testing on an albuminized blood smear.

Objective

To assess the reliability of counting smudge cells as lymphocytes in the MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears and automated differentials (ADIFFs) as a substitute for MDIFFs.

Methods

We compared corresponding results of MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears vs MDIFFs on albuminized smears (group A, n = 82), ADIFFs vs MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears (group B, n = 68), and ADIFF vs MDIFFs on albuminized smears (group C, n = 50). Smudge cells on the nonalbuminized smears were counted as lymphocytes. We focused on 2 white blood cell types: neutrophils and lymphocytes.

Results

Respective means for % lymphocytes and % neutrophils were 83.2 vs 83.2 and 14.0 vs 13.6 for Group A, 75.0 vs 77.0 and 20.2 vs 19.8 for Group B, and 76.1 vs 79.3 and 18.7 vs 17.4 for Group C. Respective correlation coefficients for % lymphocytes and % neutrophils were 0.92 and 0.94 for group A, 0.94 and 0.97 for group B, and 0.88 and 0.92 for group C.

Conclusion

Counting smudge cells as lymphocytes on nonalbuminized blood smears yielded reliable MDIFF results. Reportable ADIFF results were generated by the analyzer on 73% of the specimens, of which 93% were reliable.

2 Diagnosis

The iwCLL guidelines give clear recommendations on how to establish the diagnosis of CLL. In most cases, the diagnosis of CLL is established by blood counts, differential counts, a blood smear, and immunophenotyping. The 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors categorizes CLL into the group of mature B‐cell neoplasms. Within this category, CLL is placed in the category "pre‐neoplastic and neoplastic small lymphocytic proliferations category: MBL and CLL". This family comprises monoclonal B‐cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and CLL/SLL. CLL is described as leukemic lymphocytic lymphoma, distinguished from SLL by its leukemic appearance. CLL is always a disease of neoplastic B‐cells, while the entity formerly described as T‐CLL is called T‐cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T‐PLL). B‐prolymphocytic leukemia is no longer recognized as an entity.

The diagnosis of CLL requires the presence of ≥ 5000 B‐lymphocytes/μL in the peripheral blood for at least 3 months. The clonality of the circulating B‐lymphocytes needs to be confirmed by flow cytometry. The leukemia cells found in the blood smear are characteristically small, mature lymphocytes with a narrow border of cytoplasm and a dense nucleus lacking discernible nucleoli and having partially aggregated chromatin. These cells may be found admixed with larger or atypical cells, cleaved cells, or prolymphocytes, which may comprise up to 55% of the blood lymphocytes. Finding prolymphocytes in excess of this percentage would favor a diagnosis of prolymphocytic leukemia (B‐cell PLL). Gumprecht nuclear shadows, or smudge cells, found as cell debris, are other characteristic morphologic features found in CLL.

### Very low levels of surface CD45 reflect CLL cell fragility, are inversely correlated with trisomy 12 and are associated with increased treatment-free survival [^805c668f]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

It has recently been suggested that the percentage of smudge cells on blood smears from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) could predict overall survival. However, smudge cells are a cytological artifact influenced by multiple physical factors not related to CLL. To identify simple parameters reflecting CLL cell fragility, we studied CD45 expression in a series of 66 patients with Binet stage A CLL. Decreased CD45 expression was specific for CLL cells when compared to 44 patients with a leukemic phase of B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma and 42 control B-cells. CD45 expression was markedly decreased for all patients with CLL with high percentages of smudge cells. CLL cells with the lowest CD45 expression were the most sensitive to osmotic shock. Very low levels of CD45 expression were significantly associated with lack of CD38 expression, absence of trisomy 12, and with increased treatment free survival time. Altogether, these results demonstrate that low levels of CD45 expression are specific to CLL cells and reflect cell fragility, suggesting that this is an important intrinsic biological feature that determines disease course.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: the future has arrived [^73a075de]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia in 2019

Most patients with CLL present with an incidental finding of a lymphocytosis, they may have palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, bone marrow involvement can lead to anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Occasionally, patients may have the constitutional B symptoms with an unexplained fever of over 38°, weight loss of > 10% in less than 6 months and night sweats. A complication of CLL such as a high-grade disease transformation, an autoimmune disease or a severe infection may lead to its diagnosis.

The following diagnostic criteria are stipulated by the international workshop of CLL (iwCLL) and reiterated in the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. The lymphocytes count in the peripheral blood must be greater than 5 × 10 × 9, persistent for 3 months, and clonality of this population must be shown by flow cytometry for light chain restriction, CD5, CD23, CD79b and surface immunoglobulin expression with low levels of CD20. The presence of smudge/smear cells, an artefact of blood film production, is a typical finding in CLL. If the WCC is less than 5 × 10/L with no other signs of lymphoproliferative disorder, this constitutes monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis which is thought as a precursor to CLL, with a rate of progression of 1% per year. Identification of a clonal population of mature B cells within the lymph nodes or extranodal tissues without a peripheral blood lymphocytosis is referred to as a small lymphocytic lymphoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation is used to identify chromosomal rearrangements which can differentiate CLL from other conditions such as mantle cell lymphoma as well as helping with disease stratification.

### Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia during mohs micrographic surgery [^ac3b7ec2]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunohistochemical stains can help distinguish between leukemic and reactive infiltrates present during MMS. Leukemic infiltrates are typically CD20+/CD23+/CD5+/CD43+/CD3-. In contrast, benign reactive infiltrates are composed of T-cells that are CD20-/CD23-/CD5+/CD43+. Cytokeratin staining can also be used to evaluate for residual tumor or perineural invasion.

Workup of suspected CLL should include a complete blood count with differential count, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and a peripheral blood smear.CLL is characterized by an absolute peripheral blood B lymphocyte count of > 5 × 10 9 /L for at least 3 months. Flow cytometry should be ordered to determine the clonality of B cells. Immunophenotyping will show expression of CD5 as well as B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, CD23, and low levels of surface membrane immunoglobulin with either κ or λ light chain expression. Peripheral blood smear will show small, mature lymphocytes with dark staining nuclei and densely condensed chromatin with a narrow rim of cytoplasm. Smudge cells may be seen along with larger, atypical prolymphocytes. Though not necessary for establishing diagnosis of CLL, FISH can be performed on peripheral blood cells to identify chromosomal abnormalities common in CLL.

This case of CLL diagnosed during MMS highlights the increased risk of cutaneous malignancies associated with CLL, as well as the importance of recognizing atypical lymphocytic aggregates on Mohs sections, and the value of familiarizing oneself with the workup for such a finding.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia. two coins or two sides of the same coin? [^778e8a01]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Morphology and phenotype at diagnosis and through the follow up of the patient. In flow cytometry images, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is shown in light blue, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in red and polytypic B lymphocytes in black. At diagnosis, the morphology of lymphoid cells was consistent with prolymphocytes (A) and flow cytometry identified a predominant population of CD5 + B-cells with l chain restriction not typical of CLL corresponding to B-PLL, but also a small percent of residual polytypic B-cells (0.6% of B-cells) and CLL-like k + cells (0.7% of the B-cells) (B). At "relapse", the peripheral blood morphology was typical of CLL (clumped chromatin and smudge cells) (C), and by immunophenotype the most prominent B-cell populations corresponded to CLL k + cells (68%) and polytypic B-cells. A small amount of l + CD5 + B-PLL (3.6% of B-cells) was also seen (D). After ibrutinib, morphology showed a mixture of prolymphocytes (E, left) and CLL cells (E, right). These two populations (75% of CLL and 23% of B-PLL), along with polytypic B-cells, were demonstrated by immunophenotype (F).

### Map of ubiquitin-like post-translational modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. role of p53 lysine 120 NEDDylation [^fa2f36ca]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Structural proteins associated with phenotypical changes in CLL cells also were aberrantly modified. This is the case of proteins of the chromatin and the cytoskeleton (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Vimentin levels in CLL B cells have been inversely associated with the apparition of smudge cell in peripheral blood smear preparations and with a worse prognosis. Our screening unveiled an increase in post-translational modifications of vimentin and other cytosqueleton proteins and treatment with MLN4924 reverted those modifications along with a reduction in the amount of smudge cells (Supplemental Fig. 3). Although a more profound study is needed, these results suggest a negative effect of NEDDylation over the function of vimentin, and a role of post-translational modifications in the molecular basis of a characteristic cellular manifestation of CLL.

Post-translational modifications of p53 play a key role in its function as tumor supressor and many of them have been described. Our screening did not detect modifications in the C-terminal lysines 370, 372, and 373 of p53 in CLL. By contrast, we found a strong modification of lysine 120, that was sensitive to the treatment with MLN4924 (Supplementary Table 8). Ubiquitination and acetylation of this lysine have been previously described. To test whether this residue of p53 could also be NEDDylated, we generated the mutant K120R and cotransfected it in cells along with MDM2 and NEDD8. Compared to wild-type p53, this mutant showed a reduced sensitivity to NUB1L, a protein that specifically targets NEDDylated proteins to the proteasome, suggesting a reduction in its NEDDylation level (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with trisomy 12: a comprehensive review [^1a892d33]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

+12 is not related to a specific abnormality. However, +12 as a 'driver' mutation can facilitate the appearance of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations: disruptions of FBXW7 function may lead to constitutional activation of NOTCH1 and then to cell proliferation and evasion from apoptosis. The presence of abnormalities of FBXW7 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the CLL and determine the selection of treatment-resistant clones.

Cytopenia in patients with +12 CLL

Cytopenias are common in patients with +12 CLL. It has been reported that up to 24% of patients with +12 CLL will develop cytopenias during the course of their disease. Cytopenias in CLL can result from either bone marrow failure or autoimmune disease. Two studies showed that CLL patients with +12 have a higher incidence of autoimmune cytopenias than infiltrative cytopenias.

Morphological features of patients with +12 CLL

Atypical morphology, defined as the presence of cleaved nuclei and/or lymphoplasmacytoid features in more than 15% of cells, can be observed in up to 20% of patients with CLL. Several studies have revealed that +12 is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in these cases.

Athanasiadou et al. evaluated the presence of atypical and typical CLL morphology in a population of 100 CLL patients. In the +12 subgroup, 17 of the 23 cases analyzed (74%) were considered morphologically atypical. Atypical morphology was also frequent in the del11q/del17p subgroup (5 of 7 cases, 71%). All del13q cases and 45 of 51 cases (88%) with normal karyotypes had typical morphology.

Ruptured B cells, or smudge cells, are commonly seen in blood smears of patients with CLL. Levels of smudge cells have been correlated with low CD45 expression on CLL cells by flow cytometry. Smudge cells are believed to reflect intrinsic CLL cell fragility and cytoskeletal abnormalities, linked to reduced expression of vimentin, and some authors have proposed using percentages of smudge cells to stage CLL. In patients with +12 CLL, fewer smudge cells are observed than in patients with CLL overall, along with normal levels of CD45 expression.

Abnormal expression of CD45 in leukaemia and lymphoma

CD45 deficiency or altered expression is associated with various diseases including leukaemia and lymphoma. Immunophenotyping studies of CD45 have shown that lymphocytes exhibit the brightest intensity among the other types of leucocytes. This has led to the use of CD45 as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between immature lymphoblasts found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and plasma cell neoplasms which show weaker expression of CD45 than mature lymphoid neoplasms. Therefore, the differentiation and maturation stage determines the intensity of CD45 expression on leucocytes.

In diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Suzuki et al have found that interaction between galectin-1 and CD45 glycans could enhance cell death of lymphoma cells. Therefore, CD45 plays an important role in stimulating DLBCL cells to secrete large amounts of galectin-3, an anti-apoptotic factor, and on binding to glycan receptors on CD45, DLBCL cells becoming more sensitive to apoptosis.

CD45 expression on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells is higher than found on chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia (CLL) cells. Keeney et al showed a considerable reduction of CD45 expression in CLL patients associated with an elevated number of smudge cells, a prognostic monitor for disease management. Therefore, determining the CD45 percentages on these cells can be useful to monitor disease development.

Paediatric ALL and Hodgkin lymphoma cells have shown significant disappearance of CD45 expression. In comparison, adult ALL patients with elevated CD45 have shown reduced rate of survival. Patients with high levels of CD45 expression on multiple myeloma cells have shown a favourable prognosis, but cells are more vulnerable to oxidative stress (an apoptotic factor) with activated JAK/STAT pathway initiated by IL-6.

Saint-Paul et al found that CD45 had a role in the progression of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), as the disease develops, there is a modification in the position of CD45 within lipid rafts, cholesterol and glycosphingo lipid enriched patches located in the plasma membrane. The localisation of CD45 within or outside lipid rafts is crucial for dephosphorylation of SFKs which results in accelerating the granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signal, essential for proliferation of leukaemic cells. This discovery has shed light on targeting the position of CD45 in lipid rafts as a potential method of treatment for AML.

### Spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: an unanticipated complication of an undiagnosed disease [^ac9c0d20]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome (STLS) is a rare oncological emergency characterised by the spontaneous destruction of tumour cells in the absence of chemotherapy, with the release of large amounts of intracellular ions and metabolic products leading to organ damage and at times death. In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), historically, tumour lysis syndrome has been rarely observed owing to low rate of proliferation and slow response to chemotherapy. We report a rare case of STLS in underlying undiagnosed CLL. A man in his 60s presented with vomiting, diarrhoea, breathlessness on exertion and oliguria. Laboratory evaluation revealed a typical constellation of metabolic abnormalities; hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia with acute kidney injury. Peripheral blood examination showed lymphocytosis with smudge cells. Flow cytometry revealed atypical B lymphoid cells positive for CD5, CD19, CD23, CD45 and CD200. Bone marrow studies and lymph node biopsy supported the diagnosis of underlying CLL which was further confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation. With prompt diagnosis, intervention and intensive monitoring, the end-organ damage was successfully prevented. This case report highlights the importance of keeping high index of suspicion for STLS even without a background history of malignancy as this life-threatening condition is potentially salvageable.

### Simultaneous clinical resolution of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab [^836733cb]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although renal involvement in advanced haematological malignancies is common, glomerulonephritis associated with lymphoproliferative disorders is rare, and the related pathogenetic mechanisms are still poorly understood. We present a rare case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia(CLL)-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Case Presentation

A 53-year-old Caucasian man, previously healthy, with no history of hypertension, alcohol use or smoking presented with rapid weight gain, massive peripheral oedema, and hypertension. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 49,800 cells/mm3 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 47,000 cells/mm3, serum albumin of 2.3 g/dL, urea 65 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. A 24-hour urine collection contained 7.1 g protein and significant haematuria. A peripheral blood smear showed mature lymphocytosis and smudge cells. Diagnostic imaging showed mild paraaortic lymphadenopathy with no renal abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed diffuse and focal infiltration with B-CLL lymphocytes. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed total sclerosis in 3/21(14%) of the glomeruli and focal and segmental solidification and sclerosis in 4/21 (19%) glomeruli. A regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab was successful in inducing remission of the CLL and clinical resolution of the nephritic-range proteinuria.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to monitor both the malignancy and the glomerular lesions is crucial for the optimal management of paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis. Although chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab successfully treated CLL-associated nephrotic syndrome in our patient, further studies are required to confirm efficacy in this setting.

3 Monocytic and Myelomonocytic Leukemias

Mature and immature monocytes are usually part of the malignant clone in diverse myeloid neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myeloid leukemias. Chronic leukemias typically presenting with monocytosis include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) where only absolute monocytosis is found, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), where relative and absolute monocytosis are usually present (Table 3). Clonal monocytes in CMML and other chronic myeloid neoplasms are CD14+ cells. In myelomonocytic and monocytic AML, clonal monocytic cells may also be detected. A morphologic classification of monocytic cells and their progenitors detectable in myeloid leukemias, together with morphologic criteria, is shown in Table S5.

Patients with JMML usually present with splenomegaly, leukocytosis and monocytosis, and a hypercellular BM. Blast cells may be increased but are less than 20%. CMML is usually diagnosed in adults and defined by relative and absolute monocytosis. In most cases, leukocytosis and splenomegaly are detected. Depending on the blast count, CMML is split into CMML‐1 (BM blasts < 10% and PB blasts < 5%) and CMML‐2 (BM blasts 10%–19%, circulating blasts 5%–19%). In both JMML and CMML, the presence of AML and CML must be excluded by definition. However, both types of neoplasms can transform into overt (secondary) AML.

Based on the 2022‐updated WHO classification (5th Edition), many AML variants are defined by molecular and cytogenetic aberrations. However, two types of AML are defined by monocytic differentiation, namely acute myelomonocytic leukemia (myelomonocytic AML) and acute monocytic leukemia (monocytic AML). For myelomonocytic AML, the following criteria apply: (i) at least 20% of all cells are monocytes or monocyte precursors, (ii) ≥ 20% of cells are maturing granulocytic cells, and (iii) ≥ 3% of the blasts are positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO). Monocytic AML is defined by the following criteria: (i) ≥ 80% of cells are monocytes and/or monocyte precursors, (ii) < 20% of cells are maturing granulocytes, and iii) blasts and promonocytes (monocytic cells) must express at least two of the following markers: CD11c, CD14, CD36, or CD64 or show non‐specific esterase (NSE) positivity.

### Deep learning for diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia via recognition of genomically imprinted morphologic features [^461da82a]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In order to reduce our reliance on the CellaVision cell type classifier, we attempted to train a per-cell classifier on all cells regardless of their CellaVision classification (Fig. 1 b vii–x). This resulted in improved performance on sample-level classification in the validation cohort when using all cell types even though a model trained on all cells did not generalize as well onto the validation cohort at the per-cell level (Fig. 1 b ix, x). When looking at the per-cell predictions by CellaVision cell type, we noted that other cell types carried predictive signatures of APL including platelets (Fig. 1 b xi, xii). This finding, while surprising, is consistent with the known propensity of APL to cause bleeding, thrombosis, and DIC. While there are morphological differences in the myeloid compartment between APL and AML, other cell types also provide information useful for distinguishing APL from non-APL leukemia.

Finally, we wanted to understand the morphological differences the neural network had learned in the immature myeloid compartment that distinguished APL from non-APL leukemia. To accomplish this, we used an established method of integrated gradients to identify the distinguishing pixels of the most predictive APL vs non-APL cells (Fig. 1 c). We noted that the AI focused on cytoplasmic pixels in non-APL leukemias and nuclear pixels in APL, possibly consistent with the appearance of the chromatin on Wright staining in the non-APL leukemias being more dispersed and focused at the edge of the cell whereas, in APL, chromatin was more condensed and focused at the center of the cell. These morphological features, taught to us by the model, have not been previously reported in the literature as being useful for distinguishing APL from non-APL.

A 53-year-old Caucasian man, 78 kg, 1.67 cm, previously healthy, with no history of hypertension, alcohol use or smoking, presented with a rapid 5 kg weight gain in the past week, massive peripheral oedema, hypertension (170/90 mmHg) and leukocytosis. He had no peripheral lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A haemogram showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 49,800 cells/mm 3 with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 47,000 cells/mm 3 (Figure 1), haemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 314,000 cells/mm 3. A peripheral blood smear showed mature lymphocytosis and smudge cells. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed a clonal B-cell population (CD20+, CD79b+, CD5+, CD23+, CD43+, CD11c-, FMC7-/+, CD38-, ZAP-70 29%, ck/cλ = 66) consistent with CLL (CLL score 4). Serum albumin was 2.3 g/dL, urea 65 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, cholesterol 348 mg/dL, and beta2 microglobulin 5.39 mg/L.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^7b54129a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of hematological malignancies relies on expert cytomorphological examination of blood, bone marrow and/or other tissue biopsies, together with molecular analyses that aid subclassification and prognosis. For example, anemias, characterized by reduced hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and altered red blood cell (RBC) numbers, can be both a disease and a feature of other conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) –. For this reason, the diagnosis and further subtyping of MDS requires the detection of cytopenias, changes to white blood cell (WBC) and RBC maturation blood cell through cytomorphologic analysis of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood slides (PBS), cyto- and histochemistry, karyotyping and immunophenotyping –.

Platelet satellitism

Platelet satellitism is an in vitro phenomenon observed in anticoagulated blood samples and is characterized by the adhesion of platelets to the plasma membrane of white blood cells of normal subjects or also, more rarely, of patients with various diseases. Platelets adhere to polymorphonuclear neutrophils in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, but not in other anticoagulants (Figure 8). Occasionally, platelets have been observed adhering to lymphocytes in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (Figure 9), monocytes in heparin-anticoagulated blood in myeloproliferative neoplasms, basophils in chronic myelocytic leukemiaand several types of white blood cells, independently of the type of anticoagulant (EDTA, citrate, heparin) in cutaneous vasculitis. Platelet satellitism is much rarer than PTCP, with a prevalence of about 1:12,000 blood counts. Its frequency, however, is most likely underestimated because it often goes unnoticed, as flagging of automatic counters is inconsistent and thrombocytopenia rarely occurs, due to the in vitro "consumption" of only a small fraction of platelets. Its diagnosis is necessarily based only on the examination of peripheral blood smears under light microscopy.

Methods

Controls and patients

A total of 249 individuals were prospectively studied between November 2007 to November 2012. These subjects were classified into four subgroups: healthy donors (controls; n = 91), CLL-like MBL lo (n = 71), CLL-like MBL hi (n = 29), and newly-diagnosed previously untreated CLL patients (n = 58). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 criteria, MBL was diagnosed whenever less than 5×10 9 /L clonal B cells with a CLL phenotype were present in PB, in the absence of other signs of disease; otherwise, diagnosis of CLL was established. Within CLL, 32 patients were classified as early stage CLL (Binet A), while the remaining 26 corresponded to advanced-stage CLL (Binet B/C). In turn, MBL lo and MBL hi cases were discriminated based on a cut-off value of less than 0.5×10 9 /L circulating clonal B cells with CLL-like phenotype, as described elsewhere. Additional information about the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selection of controls and patients, as well as procedures for sample collection and storage are detailed in the Online Supplementary Methods. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Salamanca, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Immunophenotypic studies

Immunophenotypic studies were performed on erythrocytelyzed PB samples, using a high-sensitive multicolor flow cytometry approach, previously described in detail. For this purpose, PB white blood cells (WBC) were systematically stained with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) combinations detailed in Online Supplementary Table S1. For flow cytometry data analysis, the INFINICYT™ software (Cytognos S.L. Salamanca, Spain) was used. All cases showed a clonal-imbalanced surface membrane (Sm) immunoglobulin (Ig)-kappa: SmIg-lambda ratio of > 3:1 or < 1:3and/or an aberrant CD5 + CLL(-like) B-cell population. The minimum number of clustered events required to define an abnormal B-cell population was 50 cells or more.

### Acute erythroid neoplastic proliferations. A biological study based on 62 patients [^6e1db4e7]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The terms acute erythroleukemia and AML-M6 are defined in the FAB classification as proliferations of dysplastic erythroid elements mixed with blasts of myeloid origin, but pure erythroid leukemias are not included. The recent WHO classification has a category of acute myeloid leukemia not otherwise categorized, which includes acute erythroid leukemia (M6) of two subtypes: M6a-erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid) and M6b-pure erythroid leukemia. The aims of this co-operative study were to discover the incidences of these different subtypes, and pay special attention to the morphology of these entities.

Design and Methods

We reviewed a series of 62 patients with erythroid neoplastic proliferations. Previous medical history, age, sex, peripheral blood and bone marrow cell counts, cytochemical stains, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics were evaluated at presentation. We analyzed the incidence of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet abnormalities in the peripheral blood. In bone marrow we analyzed dysplastic features of erythroblasts, granulocytic elements and the megakaryocytic lineage.

Results

Fifty-three patients met the criteria of M6a subtype of the WHO classification, and 2 were classified as having pure erythremia (M6b); 7 cases could not be classified according to the WHO criteria. Fifty-five patients presented with de novo acute leukemia, and seven patients had secondary acute leukemia. The most frequent dysplastic features in blood smears were: schistocytes, tear-drop and pincered cells in erythrocytes; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in leukocytes; gigantism and hypogranulation in platelets. In bone marrow, megaloblastic changes, multinuclearity, karyorrhexis and basophilic stippling in erythroblasts; hypogranulation and gigantism in granulocytic series, and micromegakaryocytes and unconnected nuclei in megakarocytes were the most dysplastic features. A positive PAS reaction and increase of bone marrow iron with ring sideroblasts were common features. Trilineage dysplasia was present in 54% of cases. Dysplastic features in granulocytic elements were absent in 26% of patients and minimal erythroblastic dysplasia was observed in seven patients. A complex karyotype was seen in 27% of patients; chromosomes 5 and 7 were the most frequently involved.

Interpretation and Conclusions

De novo acute erythroid leukemia was more frequent than secondary cases in our series. The most frequent type of acute erythroid proliferation was the WHO M6a subtype and the least the pure erythroid leukemia. We found a group of seven patients (11%) who could not be classified according to the WHO criteria. Morphologic findings of erythrocytes in peripheral blood, such as schistocytes, tear-drop and pincered cells, were outstanding features. Morphologic aspects remain one of the most important tools for diagnosing these entities.

### Deep learning for diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia via recognition of genomically imprinted morphologic features [^4c0915ba]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In an effort to improve diagnostic reasoning, clinicians have utilized the peripheral smear to identify morphological features associated with promyelocytes associated with APL including presence of coarse granules, Auer rods, bilobed nuclei, as well as a low percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood with monocytoid features. Unfortunately, a definitive diagnosis of APL by inspection of the smear can be challenging even for the most experienced hematopathologists. This reality is further compounded by the fact that APL is a rare leukemia with an annual incidence of only 600–800 cases in the United States making prompt recognition especially difficult for providers with limited experience with leukemia. Definitive diagnosis of APL requires molecular confirmation of PML-RARA translocation, but these techniques require time and are not available in many countries with limited healthcare resources. In contrast, the peripheral smear is universally available, and easily and rapidly obtained in all healthcare settings. To this end, we hypothesized that deep learning could be used to differentiate and diagnose APL from other subtypes of myeloid leukemias solely from cellular morphology resulting from genomic imprinting that could be assessed by the power of deep learning pattern recognition. In this study, we present a deep learning approach for both descriptive and predictive purposes to learn the morphological features of APL linked to molecular translocation status and leverage this information to rapidly distinguish APL from other forms of myeloid leukemia.

### Is it primary myelofibrosis or chronic megakaryocytic leukemia? [^729baf49]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The constant, indeed central pathophysiological feature, of so-called primary myelofibrosis is the expansion of neoplastic, profoundly dysmorphic b megakaryocytes in the marrow. It, thus, could (should) be designated chronic megakaryocytic leukemia, adhering to the principle that myelogenous leukemias have multiple phenotypes, reflecting the differentiation options of both the normal and mutated multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell, the presumptive site of the foundational mutations of this family of neoplasms. The resultant neoplastic phenotypes are usually designated by the lineage that either dominates the marrow (e.g. acute promyelocytic leukemia) or is the most important pathobiological feature (e.g. chronic neutrophilic leukemia). The designation may be supplemented by its principal genetic mutations, if relatively prevalent, for example, acute myelogenous leukemia, t(8;21)(q22; q22).

In primary myelofibrosis, the megakaryocytic alterations are the most prevalent, the most constant and the most important diagnostically and pathogenically. Neoplastic expansion of megakaryocytopoiesis, megakaryocyte clusters, often around marrow sinuses, loss of anchoring to the abluminal aspect of the marrow sinus with entry of whole megakaryocytes into the sinus lumen, pleomorphic changes of megakaryocytic nuclei, sometimes described as cloud-like, as a result of nuclear ballooning and abnormal variability of nuclear and cytoplasmic features are striking. Dysmorphic platelets, megakaryocyte cytoplasmic fragments and bare megakaryocyte nuclei in the blood may be seen, especially in advanced cases. Following splenectomy, the blood contains a remarkable array of bizarre and giant platelets, megakaryocyte cytoplasmic fragments and dysmorphic micromegakaryocytes. The dominance of neoplastic megakaryocytopoiesis is evident also in cases with intense marrow fibrosis and reductions in erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis. In this setting, the bundles of reticulin (type III collagen) and other types of collagen abut arrays of dysmorphic megakaryocytes. Abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis, also, is the hallmark of patients in the prefibrotic phase of the disease.

This new definition with morphologic criteria, using conventional staining techniques in peripheral blood, would increase up to three times the number of patients diagnosed with primary PCL. This strategy is available worldwide, with independence from economic and technological resources. Finally, these patients, otherwise classified as symptomatic MM, should be enrolled early into trials using the newest immunotherapies and combined strategies available in an attempt to improve survival.

Consensus recommendation

Primary PCL is defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic MM. Careful examination of peripheral blood by conventional microscopy should be done in all patients with MM. A minimum of 100–200 nucleated cells per smear should be systematically analyzed by an experienced pathologist/hematologist. Patients with this new definition should not be excluded from clinical trials.

### An unusual case of indolent B-cell lymphoma with distinct chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal zone differentiation according to the site of involvement [^ac229d08]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

The immunological profile of lymphoproliferative disorders is usually conserved whatever the involved site, thus allowing a reliable diagnosis from peripheral blood analysis, especially in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL/CLL). Here we present a case wherein the cytology and immunophenotype of blood specimen and bone marrow argue in favor of SLL/CLL with a typical Matutes score (5/5), whereas the cyto-histology and immunophenotype of spleen specimen led to the diagnosis of splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (SMZL). Moreover genomic analysis showed that the splenic cells displayed a SMZL signature. Whereas these data suggested the presence of 2 B-cell clones, the study of the mutational status of IgVH gene in blood and spleen demonstrated the presence of a single clone, which likely developed simultaneously along two distinct ways of differentiation according to the anatomic site suggesting here the predominant role of a micro-environmental factor in cell differentiation. Although rare, this kind of event must be kept in mind as a cause of discrepancies between diagnoses from different sites.

### Closing the gap between biology and classification in splenic B-cell lymphomas [^fd76f191]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

One neoplasm that has rested uncomfortably at the margins of multiple disease entities is B‐PLL. As initially defined by Galton and colleagues in 1974 it was felt to be a rare variant of CLL, showing a marked lymphocytosis consisting of prolymphocytes (intermediate‐ to large‐sized cells with a prominent nucleolus and moderate amounts of cytoplasm; Figure 3). Bone marrow involvement in the few described initial cases was typically diffuse. Older age, common presence of B‐symptoms, rapid onset and progression and significant splenomegaly without substantial lymphadenopathy were clinical features of B‐PLL in this original series. Even though only 15 cases were reported, heterogeneity was present, as two patients were noted to be asymptomatic with incidental discovery of splenomegaly. Outcomes were poor (median survival 17 weeks), but the two incidentally discovered patients were alive at the last reported follow‐up 70 and 78 weeks from diagnosis. Since that time, the definition has shifted, with each lymphoma classification in recognition of its heterogeneous nature. In the revised 4th edition of the WHO Classification on which most reported genetic studies are based, the definition required 55% or more prolymphocytes in the peripheral blood, exclusion of prolymphocytic transformation of typical CLL and of (blastoid variant of) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Exclusion criteria were later extended to incorporate transformation/histological progression of other small B‐cell lymphomas, including splenic lymphomas such as SMZL.

Results

Patient cohort

A total of 51 patients with CLL/SLL and either CLL-HRS or CLL-HL were identified, of whom five patients were excluded. Exclusion was due to reclassification to a diagnosis other than CLL-HL or CLL-HRS (EBV-positive DLBCL[n = 3], CLL/SLL[n = 2] with increased CD20 positive large cells). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of 46 patients included in the study. Among these patients, 29 were diagnosed as CLL-HL,15 with CLL-HRS, and two patients had biopsies in which distinct areas of CLL-HRS and CLL-HL were present in the same tissue at initial diagnosis, as shown in Fig. 2. For the purposes of clinical analysis, these two are included in the CLL-HL cohort; for pathology analysis, they are included in both cohorts. The types of biopsy in each diagnostic category were as follows: CLL-HRS (eight excisional, three core needles, four bone marrow); CLL-HL (ten excisional, nine core needles, ten bone marrow); CLL-RS and CLL-HL (one excisional one core needle). The median age at the time of CLL-HL or CLL-HRS transformation diagnosis was 72 years, and there was a male predominance in both groups (71% in CLL-HL and 87% in CLL-HRS). The median time from CLL to CLL-HL transformation was 6.6 years and CLL to CLL-HRS was 4.9 years (p = 0.49).

The columns show three areas from a single lymph node in which areas of clear CLL-HRS (Area 1) and CLL-HL (Area 3) are present, along with intermediate areas in which the background is a mixture of CLL and inflammatory cells (Area 2). We hypothesize that CLL-HRS and CLL-HL exists on a biologic spectrum wherein HRS cells exist first in a cellular milieu composed of predominantly CLL cells (shown in blue in the top bar) and progress through stages where progressively more inflammatory cells (T cells, histiocytes, granulocytes, plasma cells) are recruited (shown in red in the top bar). In isolation, Area 2 would be diagnostic of CHL, while Area 1 would be diagnostic of CLL-HRS. Magnification: HE, PAX5, CD30 all 600x oil; CD3 and CD20 100x.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia. two coins or two sides of the same coin? [^882f2289]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has a distinct morphology and immunophenotype. Despite lacking specific genetic abnormalities, the diagnosis is straightforward even in cases with atypical morphology. B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is a rare lymphoid neoplasm first described in 1974 as an aggressive variant of CLL. It differs from CLL in morphology and immunophenotype and it is recognized as a distinct entity in the World Health Organisation classification. Like CLL, B-PLL does not have recurrent genetic alterations although MYC abnormalities, TP53 mutations and complex karyotypes are frequent. The diagnosis of B-PLL relies on cytology, the immunophenotype and on investigations that rule out other splenomegalic B-cell neoplasms, particularly, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). A debated issue is whether B-PLL represents the evolution of a CLL, particularly in cases with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL), or if it is a different entity. The differences in cytology, the immunophenotype and gene expression profile between CLL and B-PLL would argue against them being the same entity in two phases of disease evolution.

We describe a patient that manifested with a " bona fide " B-PLL and who was successfully treated with immunochemotherapy. Upon "relapse" there was evidence of a different B-cell clone with a morphology and immunophenotype consistent with CLL. This case reinforces the notion of the existence of B-PLL as an entity distinct from CLL.

A 57-year-old male presented with a 6-week history of weight loss and fatigue. Examination revealed splenomegaly and no lymphadenopathy. The white blood cell count (WBC) was 89.61x10 9 /L with 91% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 118 g/L and a normal platelet count. The biochemistry was normal except for lactate dehydrogenase that was raised to 894 UI/L (250–450 UI/L). No monoclonal band was detected by immunofixation. Peripheral blood (PB) showed medium to large sized lymphoid cells with a round prominent single nucleolus, and moderately basophilic cytoplasm. The morphology was consistent with the cell being a prolymphocyte (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry showed that 93% of cells were clonal B-lymphocytes l +, CD5 +, FMC7 ++. CD10, CD23, CD200 and CD43 were negative. The antigen intensity of CD20, CD22 and CD79b was normal (Figure 1B). A positron emission tomography scan confirmed the splenomegaly and showed infracentimetric widespread lymphadenopathy without F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.

### The first classification of acute myelogenous leukemia [^caed0ba3]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

TITLE Classifcation of the acute leukaemias.

AUTHORS David Galton and John Dacie.

JOURNAL Blood Cells. 1975;1:17–24.

When neoplasia originates in the multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell, the ensuing disordered pathological differentiation and maturation can result in a panoply of morphological variants of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The normal hematopoietic multipotential cell has the intrinsic capacity to differentiate into varied lineages (e.g. erythroid, neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytic, megakaryocytic, myeloid dendritic) and mature to various levels in each lineage. In AML, this capability is retained, albeit in a pathological and unpredictable manner. This remarkable array of leukemic phenotypes was baffling to hematologists even into the late 1960s. It cried out for a unifying theme, which would recognize the underlying pathophysiology.

### Automatic recognition of different types of acute leukaemia in peripheral blood by image analysis [^321a9ef8]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Morphological differentiation among different blast cell lineages is a difficult task and there is a lack of automated analysers able to recognise these abnormal cells. This study aims to develop a machine learning approach to predict the diagnosis of acute leukaemia using peripheral blood (PB) images.

Methods

A set of 442 smears was analysed from 206 patients. It was split into a training set with 75% of these smears and a testing set with the remaining 25%. Colour clustering and mathematical morphology were used to segment cell images, which allowed the extraction of 2,867 geometric, colour and texture features. Several classification techniques were studied to obtain the most accurate classification method. Afterwards, the classifier was assessed with the images of the testing set. The final strategy was to predict the patient's diagnosis using the PB smear, and the final assessment was done with the cell images of the smears of the testing set.

Results

The highest classification accuracy was achieved with the selection of 700 features with linear discriminant analysis. The overall classification accuracy for the six groups of cell types was 85.8%, while the overall classification accuracy for individual smears was 94% as compared with the true confirmed diagnosis.

Conclusions

The proposed method achieves a high diagnostic precision in the recognition of different types of blast cells among other mononuclear cells circulating in blood. It is the first encouraging step towards the idea of being a diagnostic support tool in the future.

### MBL versus CLL: how important is the distinction? [^30f0471a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is defined as a clonal B-cell expansion whereby the B-cell count is less than 5 × 10(9)/L and no symptoms or signs of lymphoproliferative disorders are detected. Based on B-cell count, MBL is further divided into low-count and clinical MBL. While low-count MBL seems to carry relevance mostly from an immunological perspective, clinical MBL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia appear to be overlapping entities. Only a deeper knowledge of molecular pathways and microenvironmental influences involved in disease evolution will help to solve the main clinical issue, i.e. how to differentiate nonprogressive and progressive cases requiring intensive follow-up.

### Percentage of smudge cells on routine blood smear predicts survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia… [^8616a49c]. ASCO (2009). Low credibility.

+versus CD38 –patients and in Zap70-positive versus Zap70-negative patients. Smudge cell percentage as a continuous variable was associated with prolonged survival. The 10-year survival rate was 50% for patients with 30% or less smudge cells compared with 80% for patients with more than 30% of smudge cells. In multivariate analysis, the percentage of smudge cells was an independent predictor of overall survival. The median follow-up time from diagnosis was 9. 9 years, and there were 43 deaths during follow-up. The vast majority of patients had early-stage disease at study entry. Zap70 status, CD38 status, and cytogenetic analysis by FISH were available for all 108 patients. IgVsequencing was attempted in all patients, with 89 patients classifiable as having either mutated or unmutated H IgV. H.

Remarkably, the 30% threshold was again confirmed using the minimal Pvalue approach. Therefore, we used a 30% cutoff to classify patients as having low- or high-risk disease based on smudge cell percentage in all analyses. The 10-year survival estimate was 50% v80% for patients with smudge cell percentage ≤ 30% vmore than 30%, respectively. The 10-year survival rate of patients with CD38 +disease and less than 30% smudge cells was only 13% compared with rates of 58%, 72%, and 85% for patients with CD38 +disease and ≥ 30% smudges cells, CD38 –disease and less than 30% smudge cells, and CD38 –disease and ≥ 30% smudge cells, respectively. 23We recently confirmed these two observations and demonstrated that the percentage of smudge cells remains constant over time in any given CLL patient.

13We also demonstrated that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with CLL B cell content of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein critical for rigidity and integrity of lymphocytes.

Pure erythroid leukemia (French-American-British classification M6) is characterized by > 80% of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow with ≥ 30% proerythroblasts and a non-significant myeloblastic component. Morphological features of this extremely rare entity are shown in the Figure. Remarkable anisopoikilocytosis of red cells and numerous morphologically abnormal erythroblasts are commonly observed in the peripheral blood (A). Bone marrow is infiltrated by very immature and atypical erythroid precursors. These large cells have round nuclei with reticular chromatin and prominent nucleolus, and hyperbasophilic, agranular, often vacuolated cytoplasm (B) or megaloblastic features and a voluminous paranuclear clear area (C). Leukemic erythroblasts are negative for myeloperoxidase and Sudan black B staining, while Perls' reaction may show several ring sideroblasts (D) and periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) stain is strongly positive with a granular pattern in the early erythroid precursors and a diffuse pattern in late erythroblasts (E). Atypical erythroid precursors show localized paranuclear reactivity for acid phosphatase (F).

The aleukemic variant "(< 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood) is much more common than the leukemic variant (≥ 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood)." Acute MCL, "characterized by the presence of C-findings/organ damage, is present in the majority of patients," whereas chronic MCL "is defined as MCL without C-findings/organ damage and may display a more indolent disease course over time, but its natural history requires more study."

### Closing the gap between biology and classification in splenic B-cell lymphomas [^d02a1496]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Peripheral blood smear in a patient with lymphocytosis showing medium to large lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli (arrows). After exclusion of evidence of mantle cell lymphoma and of pre‐existing low‐grade B‐cell neoplasm, especially CLL/SLL, this case was diagnosed as as splenic B‐cell lymphoma/leukaemia with prominent nucleoli in WHO‐HAEM5 and as B‐prolymphocytic leukaemia in ICC2022 (peripheral blood smear, May–Grünwald–Giemsa).

Using this definition, a multicentre study published in 2019 suggested the genomic landscape of B‐PLL to be characterised by TP53 deletions and MYC aberrations (translocations or copy number gains). Whole exome sequencing from this cohort showed mutations in TP53, MYD88, BCOR, MYC, SF3B1, SETD2, CHD2, CXCR4 and BCLAF1. Common abnormalities, as seen in SMZL, such as del(7q), KLF2 and NOTCH2 mutations, were either absent or found only rarely in B‐PLL. However, one of the main factors that confound this and essentially all studies on B‐PLL is the lack of tissue biopsies from spleen and often also of bone marrow, with most studies performed on peripheral blood samples. Thus, the best means of excluding known (splenic) lymphoma types with histological progression from putative bone fide de novo B‐PLL is lacking, despite the requirement in the definition. Indeed, the case has been made that primary B‐PLL might not exist as an entity, resulting in its elimination as a separate entity from the WHO‐HAEM5. Supporting the retiring of this entity includes the realisation that many candidates for a diagnosis of B‐PLL represent prolymphocytoid transformation of CLL, variants of MCL or other transformed lymphomas with marked splenomegaly such as SMZL, as well as the fact that molecular abnormalities characterising B‐PLL (e.g. MYC and TP53) are often secondary abnormalities. Rare remaining de novo cases previously classified as CD5‐negative B‐PLL are accommodated within SBLPN in WHO‐HAEM5.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: consensus definition by the international myeloma working group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^28e86b36]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) has a consistently ominous prognosis, even after progress in the last decades. PCL deserves a prompt identification to start the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of PCL according to the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients otherwise meeting diagnostic criteria of multiple myeloma. We could identify two retrospective series where the question about what number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL. The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with MM had a similar adverse prognostic impact as the previously defined PCL. Therefore, PCL should be defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Prognostic and predictive significance of smudge cell percentage on routine blood smear in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients: a single center study from Northern India… [^9dadbc8a]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Results: There were 135 males and 50 females. The median age was 60 years. Median absolute lymphocyte count was 42 X10. 9/L. Clinical Rai stage distribution was: stage 0
- 10%, stage I
- 15%, stage II
- 40%, stage III -15% and stage IV
- 20%. The median smudge cells percentage was 27%. There was no correlation of proportion of smudge cells with age, sex, lymphocyte count, organomegaly, ZAP 70 + or CD 38 + CLL patients, but there was significant correlation with stage of disease. Median smudge cell percentage in stage 0 & I -33%, stage II- 31% and stage III&IV-21%. One third of early stage patients required treatment during follow up, at the end of 5 years of follow up 55% required treatment with smudge cell < 30%, against 24% patients requiring treatment with smudge cells > 30%. The percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated with OS.

The 5-year survival rate was 51% for patients with 30% or less smudge cells compared with 81% for patients with more than 30% of smudge cells. Thirty percent of patients died during follow up. Median OS was 5 years with median follow up period of 3. 9 years. Smudge cells percentage had significant association with OS. Conclusions: Simple and inexpensive detection of smudge cells on blood smears on routine diagnostic test useful in predicting progression free and OS in CLL patients and may be beneficial in countries with limited recourses.

Figure 2.
Flow cytometric analysis of monocyte repartitioning. Flow cytometry demonstrating a markedly expanded M01 (CD14 + /CD16 –) monocyte fraction, approximating 98.79%, in a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. M01: classical monocytes; M02: intermediate monocytes; M03: non-classical monocytes.

In CMML, bone marrow biopsies are often hypercellular with granulocytic hyperplasia and mild to modest dysplasia (Figure 3D, E). Bone marrow monocytosis can be present, but is often difficult to appreciate and immunohistochemical studies that aid in the identification of monocytes and their precursors are recommended (Figure 3C). Almost 80% of patients will demonstrate micro-megakaryocytes with abnormal nuclear contours and lobations, and 20–30% of patients can have an increase in reticulin fibrosis. Approximately 30% of patients demonstrate nodules composed of mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells that are clonal (CD123 +, lineage-negative, CD45 +, CD11c –, CD33 –, HLA-DR +, BDCA-2 + and BDCA-4 +), often have RAS pathway mutations and predict for an inferior AML-free survival (Figure 3F). The identification of promonocytes requires expertise and these cells should be summated with blasts when estimating the blast count (Figure 3A, B). Promonocytes are described as monocytic precursors that have a delicately convoluted, folded or grooved nucleus with finely dispersed chromatin, a small indistinct or absent nucleolus, and finely granulated cytoplasm. On immunophenotyping the abnormal bone marrow cells often express myelomonocytic antigens such as CD13 and CD33, with variable expression of CD14, CD68 and CD64. Markers of aberrant expression include CD2, CD15, and CD56 or decreased expression of CD13, CD14, HLA-DR, CD64 or CD36. The presence of myeloblasts can often be detected by expression of CD34. The most reliable markers on immunohistochemistry include CD68R and CD163. On cytochemical analysis, monocytes are often positive for non-specific esterases and lysozyme, while the granulocytic precursors are often positive for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase (Figure 3C). This technique can help to differentiate CMML from other overlap neoplasms in which bone marrow monocytosis is uncommon. Conventional karyotyping on the bone marrow is important for cytogenetic risk stratification, with approximately 70–80% of patients demonstrating a normal karyotype. Common abnormalities include +8 and –Y, with isolated del5q, complex and monosomal karyotypes being very uncommon (complex and monosomal karyotypes can be seen in patients with therapy-related CMML). The CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) and the Mayo-French cytogenetic risk stratification system are two commonly used karyotype-based prognostic models for patients with CMML (Table 2).

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Our cohort included 11 men and 10 women, median age 68 years (range, 28–83 years). Twelve patients had a history of malignancy: 9 (43%) had myeloid neoplasms (including 6 myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and one chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]), 3 (14%) with lymphoid neoplasms, and 3 (14%) with solid tumors. Among them, 2 patients had both lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, and one patient had both solid tumor and myeloid neoplasm. The classification of these AML cases is listed in Online Supplementary Table S1. The myeloblasts (without MC differentiation) were mostly large, with small amounts of agranular cytoplasm (Figure 1B-D). The blasts with MC differentiation were usually small-to medium-sized, with a few metachromatic cytoplasmic granules, consistent with metachromatic blasts (Figure 1B-D). Atypical immature or mature MC that were round to oval, mostly mononuclear or occasionally bi-lobed or segmented nucleated, and often with hypo-granular cytoplasm, were also present. The median count of cells with metachromatic granules was 6% (range, 1–41%). Five of 18 (28%) cases had ≥ 10% cells with metachromatic granules, consistent with myelomastocytic leukemia (MML). Background dysplasia was present in 18 of 20 (90%) cases (Figure 1D). Dysplasia was observed in granulocytic (N = 15; 75%), erythroid (N = 14; 70%), and megakaryocytic (N = 10; 50%) lineages, and involved multiple lineages in 16 (80%) and a single lineage in 2 (10%) cases. Immunohistochemistry for CD117 highlighted myeloblasts (dim) and MC (bright) in the BM (Figure 1F). The median MC percentage by tryptase was 5% of the BM cellularity (range, 1–40%) and the MC were distributed in an interstitial pattern without forming aggregates. The intensity of tryptase expression in MC was weak to moderate in most cases (Figure 1G).

### Hairy cell leukemia treatment (PDQ ®)-national cancer institute… [^f6b96b37]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation Hairy cell leukemia usually presents with:

- Splenomegaly.
- Varying degrees of leukopenia.
- Pancytopenia.
- Monocytopenia.
- Bone marrow infiltration by atypical cells with prominent cytoplasmic projections. Lymphadenopathy is absent, except with multiply recurrent progressive disease. Diagnostic Evaluation The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia:

- Flow cytometry.
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
- Immunophenotyping.
- Cytogenetic analysis. BRAFgene testing.
- Computed tomography scan. The bone marrow is usually fibrotic and is not easily aspirated. It has circulating B cells with cytoplasmic projections. Although a bone marrow biopsy may be required to enroll in a clinical trial, the hairy cell leukemia diagnosis can usually be made by flow cytometry.

In addition to the B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and CD22, the cells coexpress CD11c, CD25, and CD103. The BRAF V600E pathogenic variant is a hairy cell leukemia–defining genetic feature that can aid in diagnosis. There is a variation of hairy cell leukemia which accounts for 10% of cases. HCL-v is distinguished clinically by an elevated white blood cell count and aberrant markers, including variable CD103 and the absence of CD23, CD25, CD12, and CD43. HCL-v cells also lack.
- A retrospective case series of nine patients with a histologic variation of hairy cell leukemia reported an 88% complete response rate and 3-year PFS rate of 42% after treatment with a purine nucleoside analogue plus rituximab.

Splenectomy Splenectomy plays a decreasing role in treating hairy cell leukemia because effective alternatives are available. Splenectomy will partially or completely normalize the peripheral blood in most patients with hairy cell leukemia. After a splenectomy, there is usually little or no change in the bone marrow, and virtually all patients have progressive disease within 12 to 18 months.

### Classification of myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasms: the past, present, and future [^c4a32e81]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these advances in the uses of the microscope in medicine, it was not until 1846 that Fuller and Cantab diagnosed a leukemic proliferation in a living patient using microscopic examination of peripheral blood. In 1869, Neumann finally discovered a link between the bone marrow and these disorders. This discovery opened the door to a better understanding of the complexity of the diseases previously viewed as "leukemia." While the concepts of acute and chronic remained to be clarified, the idea that different disorders arose in the bone marrow versus the spleen and lymph nodes was a critical finding.

The next major discovery to occur was in the work of Ehrlich in 1877 when he began to apply new discoveries in aniline dyes to stain peripheral blood and other smears to allow for more detailed examination of the cells that were previously simply called white blood cells. The ability to observe specific staining patterns of blood and bone marrow cells became critical to the discovery of specific cell types involved in myeloid disorders.

With these tools, clinicians began to identify differing clinical and hematologic features of patients, and based on case reports and small series, early disease entities were described. What we now consider primary myelofibrosis was described in several reports in what was termed osteosclerotic anemia or Heuck‐Assmann syndrome. William Osler, summarizing his own cases and prior case reports proposed what is now considered polycythemia vera as a clinical entity in 1903. This was followed by the description of di Guglielmo's syndrome in 1917 and essential thrombocythemia in 1934. By the early 20th century, four main types of leukemia were classified: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and erythroleukemia.

Scope of fellow competency

A total of 50 morphologic features and 26 morphologic diagnoses were coded by all 8 participants as either being required for fellow competency or as aspirational (Tables 3 and 4). Substantial interrater agreement was noted for each (k = 0.76 and k = 0.68, respectively). The percentage of interrater agreement on morphology was 87.8% and for morphologic diagnoses, 84.2%. Only 4 morphologic features (4/50, 8%) and 6 diagnoses (6/26, 23%) were felt to be beyond the level of competency for a graduating hematology fellow. These features included Sézary cells, Pappenheimer bodies, hypogranular platelets, and the distinction between monocytes and monoblasts. Identification of mantle cell lymphoma in circulation, myelodysplastic syndrome, May-Hegglin anomaly, T-cell leukemias, and the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were said to be aspirational.

Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) — diagnosis and immunophenotype — Adequate hematopathology review of biopsy materials and immunophenotyping are needed to establish a diagnosis, and SMZL is most definitively diagnosed at splenectomy because the immunophenotype is nonspecific and morphologic bone marrow features may not be diagnostic. In a patient with splenomegaly (small or no M component) and characteristic intrasinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration of the bone marrow, the diagnosis can strongly be suggested on bone marrow biopsy if the immunophenotype is consistent, and plasmacytoid differentiation with cytoplasmic Ig detectable on paraffin sections may occur. In such circumstances, the differential diagnosis may include WM/LPL, and MYD88 mutation analysis and BRAF mutation analysis can be useful in selected circumstances for differentiating SMZL from WM/LPL and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). On bone marrow biopsy, SMZL lacks CD5, CD10, and cyclin D1, and recommended immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers include CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD21 or CD23, CD43, kappa/lambda, IgD, CCND1, BCL2, annexin A1, and BRAFV600E; recommended flow cytometry markers include CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, CD10, CD43, and CD103. The typical immunophenotype is CD5-, CD10-, CD20+, CD23 ±, CD43-, cyclin D1-, BCL2-germinal centers, annexinA1-, CD103-, BRAFV600E-, with expression of both IgM and IgD, and this lymphoma is distinguished from CLL by absence of CD5, strong CD20, and variable CD23 expression, and from HCL by absence of CD103, CCND1, or BRAFV600E expression.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^d7427fcb]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Red cell neoplasms: classification and criteria

Red cell neoplasms can be classified according to their etiology (de novo or secondary, i.e. following MDS or a mutagenic event), WHO criteria and the presence or absence of certain molecular markers. Erythroid neoplasms include PV (JAK2 -mutated or wild-type JAK2), MDS with a prominent erythroid compartment (previously AML M6) and (pure) erythroid leukemia (Table 4). Based on the 2017 update of the WHO classification, erythroid neoplasms have been reclassified. In the previous definition provided by the French-American-British group and later by the WHO, a blast cell percentage of ≥ 20% in the non-erythroid compartment together with erythroid predominance (≥ 50% of nucleated bone marrow cells) was indicative of AML (AML M6). In the 2017 update of the WHO classification, these cases are reclassified as MDS (usually MDS with excess blasts) unless the total blast cell percentage (without subtracting erythroid cells) is ≥ 20%. – In the case of a total blast cell percentage of ≥ 20% and erythroid predominance, the final diagnosis is AML [AML not otherwise specified (NOS), acute erythroid leukemia of erythroid/myeloid type] unless molecular or cytogenetic markers identify another AML subtype. – In those with > 80% immature erythroid precursors, ≥ 30% proerythroblasts and a total blast cell percentage < 20%, the final diagnosis is acute erythroid leukemia (AML, pure erythroid type). In an updated revision, AML NOS, acute erythroid leukemia (erythroid/myeloid type) was replaced by AML NOS (erythroid subtype). Overall, the erythroid leukemias appear to comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies. For example, erythroid leukemias can occur as primary (de novo) leukemia or as a secondary form of leukemia, for instance, following MDS or MPN (Online Supplementary Table S1). In rare cases, even the blast phase of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia may have a clinical and pathological picture indistinguishable from that of erythroleukemia (Online Supplementary Figure S2). It is also important to note that erythroleukemia can develop as an acute and rapidly progressive disease or a more chronic form of leukemia. The acute forms of erythroid leukemias represent a diagnostic challenge and may be overlooked. Rarely, acute erythroleukemia presents as a large-cell anaplastic neoplasm mimicking a histiocytic malignancy or even small-cell carcinoma; such cases can also easily be overlooked unless appropriate phenotypic studies with antibodies against glycophorin A/C or CD71 are conducted (H-PH, unpublished observation). The chronic form of erythroleukemia must be distinguished from PV and reactive erythrocytosis (polyglobulia), for example, in cases with an erythropoietin-producing tumor.

### Filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio) [^d779c608]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation‚ differentiation commitment‚ and some end-cell functional activation.

Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemiluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl‑phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however‚ the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^3ce31f4f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) — diagnostic definition and variants. MCL is defined histopathologically by the presence of greater than or equal to 20% neoplastic mast cells on a bone marrow aspirate smear, and when an aspirate is a dry tap and unevaluable, MCL may be diagnosed on a core biopsy if a dense, diffuse infiltrate of atypical, immature mast cells is present. The ICC does not distinguish between acute and chronic MCL and only uses the term MCL. The aleukemic variant (< 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood) is much more common than the leukemic variant (≥ 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood). Acute MCL, characterized by the presence of C-findings/organ damage, is present in the majority of patients, whereas chronic MCL is defined as MCL without C-findings/organ damage and may display a more indolent disease course over time, but its natural history requires more study.

Flow cytometry is the primary tool for phenotyping leukemias and related conditions. With the ever increasing numbers of antibodies commercially available, the ability to study and understand leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases is improving. Although the data generated by flow cytometry are not comprehensive enough to completely subtype leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes into their myriad divisions, this wealth of information does provide phenotype, reproducible enumeration of blasts, certain prognostic information, and it can reveal the presence of cell populations with aberrant antigen profiles. An important drawback to flow cytometry as it is performed today is the inability to look at the cells that mark with the antibody panels used. As classifications of leukemia and related conditions evolve, flow cytometry continues to answer many of the questions asked and to provide critical information reliably and quickly.

### Morphometric and colorimetric analysis of peripheral blood smears lymphocytes in B-cell disorders: proposal for a scoring system [^951b2a40]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2001). Low credibility.

Distinguishing leukemic phases of B-cell disorders in peripheral blood smears is well recognized to be difficult in some cases since it depends on subtle and subjective criteria. In order to quantify cytological features and to assess objective descriptions, a morphometric analysis was performed on 83 peripheral blood smears of B-cells disorders (n = 77) and healthy donors (n = 6). Using standardized May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, standardized image acquisition system and well defined microscopic fields, we have analyzed lymphoid cells, measuring morphometric and color parameters. By combining seven relevant morphometric criteria (the nuclear shape, the cellular shape and area, the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, the nuclear red/blue ratio, the cytoplasmic green/blue ratio and the proportion of cells with nucleolus), we have established a score that could range from a minimum of -3 (large B-CLL type) to a maximum of +8 (large MCL type): negative scores corresponds to different types of B-CLL (n = 30), including "atypical B-CLL" (n = 6), the score zero correspond to healthy donors (n = 6) used as baseline, the positive score values correspond to +1 for Follicular lymphoma (n = 2), +3 for Splenic Lymphoma with Villous Lymphocytes (n = 12), +4 for Hairy Cell Leukemia (n = 7), for Hairy Cell Leukemia-variant (n = 2), +6 for B-prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 6) and +7 and +8 for most Mantle Cell Lymphoma (n = 18). Testing T-cell disorders samples (n = 10) using the same protocol, the profile is different and cannot be confused with B-cell diseases. Our scoring system indicates that measurement of some common morphologic features in standardized conditions provides objective criteria to characterize those diseases and might be helpful for diagnosis.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia: a review [^dc5ec2da]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic myeloid leukemia:

- **Definition**: CML is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: CML is caused by a chromosomal abnormality termed as Philadelphia chromosome, which results from the presence of BCR-ABL oncogene.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, abdominal fullness, bleeding, purpura, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Disease progression may lead to bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, infections, lymphadenopathy, CNS disease, and increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CML is associated with a mortality crude rate of 0.78.

### Quantitative cytologic descriptors to differentiate CLL, Sézary, granular, and villous lymphocytes through image analysis [^614136d9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to find descriptors to identify chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Sézary, granular, and villous lymphocytes among normal and abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood.

Methods

Image analysis was applied to 768 images from 15 different types of lymphoid cells and monocytes to determine four discriminant descriptors. For each descriptor, numerical scales were obtained using 627 images from 79 patients. An assessment of the four descriptors was performed using smears from 209 new patients.

Results

Cyan correlation of the nucleus identified clumped chromatin, and standard deviation of the granulometric curve of the cyan of the nucleus was specific for cerebriform chromatin. Skewness of the histogram of the u component of the cytoplasm identified cytoplasmic granulation. Hairiness showed specificity for cytoplasmic villi. In the assessment, 96% of the smears were correctly classified.

Conclusions

The quantitative descriptors obtained through image analysis may contribute to the morphologic identification of the abnormal lymphoid cells considered in this article.

Haematogones have been extensively characterized in bone marrow, but not in the peripheral blood (PB). We studied 102 PB samples from adult patients with a sensitive flow cytometry method. Sixty-six of 102 samples (65%) contained detectable haematogones, ranging from 0.01% to 1.3% of white blood cells (median 0.06%, mean 0.13%). Of 66 cases with complete blood count data, 51 had absolute haematogone counts of 0.00037–0.105 x 10(9)/l (median 0.0054 x 10(9)/l, mean 0.012 x 10(9)/l). PB haematogones belonged exclusively to the most mature maturational stage. These findings have implications for PB analysis of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and follicular lymphoma.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: consensus definition by the international myeloma working group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^845ec3d9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We have reviewed the literature, looking for validation of alternative cutoffs for the diagnosis of primary PCL in prospective or retrospective series of patients with MM. We could identify only two retrospective series where the question about what number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL. The objective in both groups was to investigate if lower values (such as 5% or more plasma cells) have the same prognostic impact as the historical criteria. In a previous report from China, the impact of the morphological examination was also assessed, even if the cutoff for high-risk group/PCL was not consistent with the other reports. This study was excluded because it only stratified MM patients with vs. without circulating plasma cells using a cut-off of 2%, instead of 5% as in the other included papers. There are other experiences also validating the lower cutoff of 5% with prognosis significance similar to classical PCL but only presented at meetings.

The objective was to summarize the results of previously published data regarding the outcomes of patients with a lower circulating plasma cell threshold from both series, one from 5 university hospitals in Catalonia, Spain (100 patients) and the other from Mayo Clinic (176 patients), in order to support the new definition of PCL. These cases were compared to simultaneous and consecutive controls over the same period of time in the first series (382 patients) and historical controls in the second (9724 patients), respectively. The Catalan series was published previously, serving the second one (Mayo Clinic) as validation series.

Peripheral blood smears stained with Wright–Giemsa were used for calculating plasma cell percentage by morphology: patients with no peripheral blood smears were excluded in both series. In the Mayo Clinic series, the percentage was obtained from the peripheral blood count showed in the medical report. The number of evaluated cells was not specified. In addition, in the Catalan series 5 expert hematologists on peripheral blood cytology reviewed all the smears, with a minimum of 100 nucleated cells per smear systematically counted using the same common criteria. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome and was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up in both studies. OS and baseline characteristics of these patients were compared to the controls and the independent prognostic impact of circulating plasma cells was addressed.
