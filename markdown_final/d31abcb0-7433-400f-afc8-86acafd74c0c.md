## Question

Can granisetron be given 1 mg BID daily for a patient taking an oral PARP inhibitor as an indefinite medication?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether granisetron 1 mg twice daily can be given indefinitely for a patient taking an oral PARP inhibitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indications and dosing limits for oral granisetron. Then, I should review the emetogenic mechanism and clinical pattern of nausea with PARP inhibitors. Next, I will check whether any guidelines or trials support chronic 5-HT3 antagonist use in this setting. After that, I will evaluate safety considerations with long-term granisetron. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and consider safer, evidence-aligned alternatives [^111Lakx7] [^1157jUkK] [^115Q5KGD].

> Let me first confirm the FDA labeling for oral granisetron; the tablet dosing is either 2 mg once daily or 1 mg twice daily, administered around chemotherapy, and the label explicitly states that either regimen should be given only on the days chemotherapy is administered and that continued treatment while not on chemotherapy has not been found to be useful [^111Lakx7].

> I need to check the nature of PARP inhibitor therapy and its emetogenic pattern; PARP inhibitors are typically administered as continuous daily oral agents for maintenance or monotherapy in ovarian cancer, and chronic low-grade nausea is among their most common toxicities, with management strategies remaining poorly defined in the literature, which underscores the absence of a standardized antiemetic protocol for this scenario [^1157jUkK] [^116dXncP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, but I should identify any mechanistic mismatch; granisetron's 1 mg twice-daily regimen is designed to blunt the acute serotonin-mediated emetic reflex during or just after cytotoxic chemotherapy, whereas PARP inhibitor–related nausea is more chronic and likely not driven by the same acute enterochromaffin 5‑HT3 surge, making indefinite granisetron use mechanistically incongruent with the pathophysiology here [^111Lakx7] [^116QY76L] [^116dXncP].

> I should confirm the safety profile if one were to use granisetron chronically; the FDA warns about QT prolongation, advises caution with other QT-prolonging drugs, and highlights the potential for serotonin syndrome with concomitant serotonergic agents, while granisetron also slows colonic transit and commonly causes constipation, all of which raise concerns with long-term exposure in a maintenance setting devoid of supportive efficacy data [^116JKi2p] [^114Bv2Gz] [^116QY76L].

> Next, I should review guideline support; the provided ASCO antiemetic guidelines address acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, but they do not provide recommendations for chronic antiemetic prophylaxis with targeted oral agents like PARP inhibitors, and within the provided evidence I do not see high-quality data supporting indefinite 5‑HT3 antagonist therapy for PARP inhibitor–related nausea [^115Q5KGD] [^117VRbMR] [^112FMear] [^116dXncP].

> Let me think about pharmacologic plausibility; granisetron blocks 5‑HT3 receptors activated by serotonin released from damaged enterochromaffin cells during cytotoxic exposure, a process that explains its peri-chemotherapy utility, whereas PARP inhibitor–related nausea likely involves different central or peripheral pathways, so indefinite 5‑HT3 blockade lacks a clear mechanistic rationale in this context and risks harm without proven benefit [^116QY76L] [^116dXncP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, at first glance I wondered if long-acting options like palonosetron or extended-release/subcutaneous or transdermal granisetron might better cover multi-day symptoms; but let me verify the evidence scope — these formulations have been studied around chemotherapy cycles, including multi-day regimens, not for open-ended daily targeted therapy, so extrapolating them to indefinite PARP inhibitor use would remain off-label and unsupported by trial data [^1128Gbxz] [^113y9ygT] [^113CGKKF] [^113HHpBP].

> I will now synthesize the recommendation; no, granisetron 1 mg twice daily should not be prescribed indefinitely for a patient on an oral PARP inhibitor, because this practice contradicts the FDA label limiting use to chemotherapy days, lacks supportive evidence for chronic targeted-therapy–related nausea, and exposes patients to cumulative safety risks such as QT prolongation and constipation without proven benefit [^111Lakx7] [^116JKi2p].

> Let me consider practical alternatives; I should confirm that supportive care starts with nonpharmacologic strategies and PARP inhibitor dose interruptions or adjustments when clinically appropriate as per oncologic management principles, and if pharmacologic therapy is needed, short-course or as-needed antiemetics — individualized and closely monitored — may be tried, such as brief 5‑HT3 RA use, olanzapine, or an NK1 receptor antagonist during exacerbations, recognizing these are extrapolated from CINV guidance rather than validated for PARP inhibitor nausea, with ECG monitoring considered when QT risk is present and a shared decision-making approach given the evidence gap [^1157jUkK] [^117VRbMR] [^112qf3yr] [^116JKi2p].

---

No, granisetron 1 mg BID is **not recommended** as an indefinite daily regimen for patients on oral PARP inhibitors because it is only approved for short-term use during chemotherapy or radiotherapy days [^111Lakx7]. Indefinite use increases risks of **QT prolongation** [^113yPQkz] and **serotonin syndrome** [^116JKi2p], especially with other QT-prolonging or serotonergic drugs. For chronic PARP inhibitor–related nausea, consider alternatives such as olanzapine, metoclopramide, or NK1 antagonists, and reserve granisetron for short-term or breakthrough use only [^116dXncP].

---

## Granisetron dosing and approved indications

Granisetron is a selective **5-HT3 receptor antagonist** indicated to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy [^116QY76L]. The FDA-approved oral regimens are: for **chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)**, 2 mg once daily or 1 mg twice daily, given only on the day(s) chemotherapy is administered [^111Lakx7]; for **radiation-induced nausea and vomiting**, 2 mg once daily within 1 hour of radiation [^111Lakx7]. Importantly, continued daily treatment outside chemotherapy or radiation days is **not recommended** [^111Lakx7].

---

## Safety considerations for indefinite granisetron use

Although granisetron is generally well tolerated for short-term use, indefinite daily administration raises **significant safety concerns**:

- **QT prolongation**: Granisetron has been associated with QT interval prolongation [^113yPQkz], increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and other serious arrhythmias. Chronic use may exacerbate this risk, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those taking other QT-prolonging medications [^114xWFob].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Granisetron, as a serotonergic agent, carries a risk of serotonin syndrome [^116JKi2p], especially when combined with other serotonergic medications. Indefinite use may increase this risk.

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Chronic use of granisetron may lead to constipation or gastrointestinal obstruction, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions [^114Bv2Gz].

- **Other adverse effects**: Headache, asthenia, somnolence, and diarrhea have been reported with granisetron use [^113yPQkz]. Chronic administration may increase the frequency or severity of these adverse effects.

---

## Drug interactions with PARP inhibitors

Granisetron does not meaningfully induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes [^116CEZzv], indicating a **low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions** with PARP inhibitors. However, both granisetron [^113yPQkz] and some PARP inhibitors (e.g. olaparib) have been associated with QT prolongation, which may increase the risk of additive cardiotoxicity.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Currently, **no clinical guidelines** or expert recommendations support the indefinite daily use of granisetron for managing chronic nausea associated with oral PARP inhibitors [^116dXncP]. Granisetron is recommended for short-term use during chemotherapy or radiation therapy, not for chronic administration [^115Q5KGD].

---

## Alternative antiemetic strategies

Given the lack of evidence for indefinite granisetron use, **alternative antiemetic strategies** should be considered for managing chronic nausea associated with oral PARP inhibitors:

- **Olanzapine**: Effective for both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting, including chronic nausea associated with oral anticancer agents.

- **Metoclopramide**: Useful for chronic nausea management, particularly in patients with delayed gastric emptying.

- **NK1 receptor antagonists (e.g. aprepitant)**: Effective for delayed nausea and vomiting, including chronic nausea associated with oral anticancer agents [^112TLsNw].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Dietary modifications, acupuncture, and behavioral therapy may also be beneficial.

---

## Monitoring and patient counseling

If granisetron is used chronically, **careful monitoring and patient counseling** are essential:

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Regular ECG monitoring to assess QT interval prolongation [^116JKi2p].

- **Serotonin syndrome monitoring**: Vigilance for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome [^116JKi2p].

- **Gastrointestinal monitoring**: Monitoring for constipation or gastrointestinal obstruction [^114Bv2Gz].

- **Patient counseling**: Educate patients about potential adverse effects, drug interactions, and the importance of adherence to monitoring protocols [^116JKi2p].

---

Granisetron 1 mg BID is **not recommended for indefinite daily use** in patients taking oral PARP inhibitors due to safety concerns, including QT prolongation [^113yPQkz] and serotonin syndrome [^116JKi2p]. Alternative antiemetic strategies should be considered [^116dXncP], and if granisetron is used chronically, careful monitoring and patient counseling are essential.

Patients should be informed that the most common adverse reactions for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are headache and constipation. For postoperative nausea and vomiting, common adverse reactions include pain, headache, fever, abdominal pain, and increased hepatic enzymes.

Patients should be advised of the risk of allergic reactions if they have previously experienced an allergic reaction to a class of antiemetics known as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

Electrocardiogram changes, specifically QT prolongation, have been reported with the use of granisetron hydrochloride. Patients should be cautioned about using this drug if they have heart problems or are taking medications for heart conditions.

Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic agents, such as medications for depression and migraines. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms such as changes in mental status, autonomic instability, or neuromuscular symptoms, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Granisetron: An update on its clinical use in the management of nausea and vomiting [^111hyzQj]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are typical side effects of cytotoxic therapy and some surgical procedures. These symptoms can represent a major therapeutic challenge and, if inadequately controlled by antiemetic treatment, may lead to increased mortality, morbidity, and health care costs. However, the management of nausea and vomiting has significantly improved in recent years with the introduction of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists, known as 'setrons'.

In light of recent advances in antiemetic care, including the approval of the first neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist, aprepitant (Emend; Merck and Company, Inc.; West Point, PA), and a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, palonosetron (Aloxi; MGI Pharma; Minneapolis, MN), this article provides an update on the clinical experience with the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist granisetron (Kytril; Roche Laboratories, Inc.; Nutley, NJ) for managing chemotherapy-induced, radiation-induced, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. It also reviews its use in special patient populations.

Granisetron is a potent and highly selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other receptors, a characteristic thought to underlie the favorable side-effect and safety profiles of this agent. Extensive clinical trial data have shown granisetron to be an effective and well-tolerated agent for treating nausea and vomiting in oncology and surgical settings. Granisetron has also proven effective and well tolerated in special populations, such as patients refractory to antiemetic treatment.

### A randomized double-blind trial to compare the clinical efficacy of granisetron with metoclopramide, both combined with dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced delayed emesis [^116nkCNt]. Annals of Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The prophylactic use of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists (setrons) after the first 24 hours of exposure to emetic chemotherapy, to decrease the incidence of 'delayed phase' emesis, increases costs. We designed a study to evaluate the efficacy of a setron (granisetron) in the delayed phase, compared with metoclopramide, each combined with a corticosteroid.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients on their first course of single-day emetic chemotherapy (cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and others) received granisetron 2 mg p.o. and dexamethasone 8 mg p.o. on day 1, followed for 5 days by dexamethasone 4 mg p.o. od combined with either metoclopramide 20 mg p.o. tds or granisetron 1 mg bd in a double-blinded double-dummy protocol. Patients evaluated the results using a diary card. Randomization was stratified by institution, sex, emetic chemotherapy naïve versus previous, alcohol consumption, and platinum versus non-platinum regimen.

- **Results**: 131 evaluable patients received granisetron in the delayed phase, and 127 received metoclopramide. Control of acute emesis in both arms was similar (86% granisetron; 85% metoclopramide). The 35 patients experiencing acute emesis had poor control in the delayed phase, with only four granisetron and three metoclopramide patients having no or mild nausea and no vomiting.

- **Conclusions**: In daily practice, a combination of oral dexamethasone and oral granisetron achieves an extremely high control of acute emesis (86% protection). Our data suggest that routine prescription of setrons for delayed phase control is not advised.

### Antiemetics: ASCO guideline update [^115Q5KGD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, more specifically with respect to prophylactic antiemetics and moderately emetogenic radiotherapy, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend administering a 5-HT3-RA before each fraction. This can be done with or without dexamethasone, before the first five fractions in adult patients treated with moderately emetogenic radiotherapy.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^111Lic9p]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Pooled patient-level data from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase III trials were analyzed. Two of the trials were conducted in patients scheduled to receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and two in patients scheduled to receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). Notably, 64% of patients in the study by Eisenberg et al. received anthracycline + cyclophosphamide (AC), which is currently classified as HEC; at the time of the study, AC was classified as MEC. Three trials were conducted in Europe or North America, and one was in Japan. All four studies received approval from institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at their respective sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients before the initiation of any study-related procedures.

- **5HT3 receptor antagonists (RAs)**: All 5HT3 RAs were administered as a single IV dose 30 minutes before the scheduled chemotherapy regimen.
- **Dexamethasone administration**:
	- Patients could also receive dexamethasone, 20 mg IV, 15 minutes before chemotherapy.
	- All patients also received dexamethasone, 16 mg IV, 45 minutes before 5HT3 RAs, plus another IV (8 mg) or oral dose (4 mg) on days 2 and 3 after chemotherapy.​

### Guidelines versus individualized care for the management of CINV [^111HDXAm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

There have been several significant updates to the consensus guidelines for CINV prophylaxis. In addition to the many novel agents now added to the emetogenic classification categories (over 40 new drugs added in the recently updated MASCC/ESMO CINV guidelines), AC has been reclassified as HEC instead of MEC.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis for carboplatin has also been revised in the MASCC/ESMO, NCCN, and ASCO guidelines. Although carboplatin is classified as MEC, the emetogenic potential is at the higher end of the MEC range (82 to 84% according to clinical trials). Recent phase II and phase III studies have shown that adding an NK-1 receptor antagonist to a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone therapy can increase the complete response (CR; no vomiting and no use of rescue medication) by approximately 10 to 15% in patients receiving carboplatin chemotherapy.

As a result, MASCC/ESMO guidelines recommend incorporation of an NK-1 receptor antagonist such as aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant, or rolapitant. NCCN and ASCO guidelines also recommend inclusion of an NK-1 receptor antagonist for patients receiving carboplatin at doses resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 4 mg/mL per minute.

### Ondansetron [^116Ppb5B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting**: In two randomized, double-blind monotherapy trials, a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron was superior to a relevant historical placebo control in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m². Steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients receiving a cisplatin dose greater than or equal to 50 mg/m² in the historical-placebo comparator experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.

- **Highly emetogenic chemotherapy**: The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron - 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for two doses, and 32 mg as a single dose - in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m². The initial or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24-mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8-mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32-mg once-a-day group completed the 24-hour trial period with zero emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the three treatment groups was shown to be statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control.

### A phase III, double-blind, randomized trial of palonosetron compared with ondansetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy [^1128Gbxz]. Annals of Oncology (2006). High credibility.

This pivotal phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of palonosetron in preventing acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC).

- **Patients and methods**: Patients were randomized to a single intravenous dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg or 0.75 mg, or ondansetron 32 mg prior to HEC. Dexamethasone pre-treatment (with stratification) was used at investigator discretion. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) during the first 24 hours post-chemotherapy (acute phase).

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat analysis (n = 667), palonosetron 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg were at least as effective as ondansetron in preventing acute CINV (59.2%, 65.5%, and 57.0% CR rates, respectively); CR rates were slightly higher with palonosetron than ondansetron during the delayed (24–120 h) and overall (0–120 h) phases. Two-thirds of patients (n = 447) received concomitant dexamethasone. Patients pre-treated with palonosetron 0.25 mg plus dexamethasone had significantly higher CR rates than those receiving ondansetron plus dexamethasone during the delayed (42.0% versus 28.6%) and overall (40.7% versus 25.2%) phases. Palonosetron and ondansetron were well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Single-dose palonosetron was as effective as ondansetron in preventing acute CINV following HEC, and with dexamethasone pre-treatment, its effectiveness was significantly increased over ondansetron throughout the 5-day post-chemotherapy period.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^113piiJa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The methods for each study have been previously described in detail. Patients enrolled in the four studies were required to be at least 18 years of age, have a histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy, and have a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of ≥ 50%. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive single intravenous (IV) doses of palonosetron (0.25 or 0.75 mg) or older 5HT 3 RAs: ondansetron (32 mg), dolasetron (100 mg), and granisetron (40 μg/kg), all administered 30 minutes before the scheduled chemotherapy regimens. Consistent with guidelines at the time of the studies, concomitant steroids were permitted or required in three of the four studies.

In each study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate, defined as no emesis and no rescue medication, during the acute (0–24 h), delayed (> 24–120 h), and/or overall (0–120 h) postchemotherapy treatment periods. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the complete control (CC) rate, defined as no emesis, no rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea, during the acute, delayed, and overall postchemotherapy treatment periods; numbers of emetic and nausea episodes; and nausea severity, which was rated on a four-point Likert scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory test results, and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings.

### Granisetron: Relating pharmacology to clinical efficacy [^115sFSDE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, regarded as the "antiemetic gold-standard", are used for prophylaxis against chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced emesis. At equally effective doses, these antagonists have demonstrated broadly equivalent clinical antiemetic activity and safety. However, the pharmacology of granisetron suggests that it may offer an improved side-effect and tolerability profile, a lower risk of drug interactions, and a longer duration of action compared to other 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. The high affinity of granisetron, coupled with the insurmountable antagonism displayed at 5-HT(3) receptors, is thought to underlie its good clinical efficacy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of transdermal granisetron for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately and highly emetogenic multi-day chemotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^114opoFb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Further investigation is needed to determine how the pharmacokinetics of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (RAs) affect their pharmacodynamics; for example, it is unclear how the single-peak, sustained pharmacokinetics of the GTDS might impact its efficacy compared to the reduced peak–tail fluctuations observed with long-acting palonosetron. Such investigations could also include the addition of oral or intravenous granisetron on the first day of GTDS therapy to achieve therapeutic levels of granisetron more rapidly.

Furthermore, it would be of interest to examine the effects of combining the GTDS with neurokinin-1 (NK-1) RAs, such as aprepitant. NK-1 RAs were not included in this study, as these agents were not available in some participating centers at the time of study commencement. Given the previously demonstrated efficacy of NK-1 RAs against delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when added to 5-HT 3 RA therapy, it seems reasonable to postulate that their addition to GTDS therapy may improve control of CINV, particularly on the latter days of chemotherapy. The addition of NK-1 RAs to GTDS therapy would be expected to be well tolerated, as 5-HT 3 RAs and NK-1 RAs are commonly used in combination.

The results of this randomized phase III study suggest that the GTDS could provide a valuable new option for the control of CINV in patients receiving multi-day chemotherapy regimens. Since 5-HT 3 RAs, including granisetron, are also used outside of CINV, the clinical application of the GTDS may eventually be broadened.

### Antiemetics: ASCO guideline update [^112FMear]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, specifically concerning prophylactic antiemetics and low/minimally emetogenic radiotherapy, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend administering breakthrough therapy with a 5-HT3-RA, dexamethasone, or a dopamine-receptor antagonist in adult patients treated with minimally emetogenic radiotherapy.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113yv8Mq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron injection is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of:

- **Nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high-dose cisplatin. It is approved for patients aged 6 months and older.

- **Postoperative nausea and/or vomiting**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended for patients with little expectation of experiencing nausea and/or vomiting postoperatively. However, for patients where postoperative nausea and/or vomiting must be avoided, ondansetron injection is recommended even when the incidence is low. If patients do not receive prophylactic ondansetron injection and experience nausea and/or vomiting postoperatively, ondansetron injection may be administered to prevent further episodes. It is approved for patients aged 1 month and older.

### Antiemetic guidelines: Creating a more practical treatment approach [^114LmNLR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Antiemetic guidelines from a variety of professional organizations have been available for several years. It is unclear just how often these guidelines have been used, however; data indicate that some practitioners still do not treat their patients according to the recommendations. Some of those involved in the creation of the original guidelines convened to try to create a simpler, more practical approach to the use of antiemetics in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The group's intention was to clarify available guidelines and produce a practical document, based on evidence, that could be used in everyday practice. The group created four consensus statements that would serve as a basis for their recommendations.

One primary strategy used was to have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting viewed as a single process that can occur throughout a treatment cycle, and not so much as an acute and a delayed process, as is usual in clinical trials. Patients' management should be considered over a 4- to 5-day period, rather than primarily dealing with the day of treatment only. The group created three tables: emetic risk of chemotherapy; treatment options based on emetic category; and antiemetic dosing recommendations. Use of these tables should make appropriate antiemetic selection more straightforward and easier for the practitioner in an everyday setting. Although this document alone may not solve all the challenges with appropriate antiemetic management, it will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction.

### Management of nausea and vomiting from poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy for advanced ovarian cancer [^116dXncP]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have rapidly emerged as a new class of daily oral chemotherapeutic agents with the potential to dramatically alter the treatment of primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, and ovarian cancers. However, the management of nausea and vomiting — the most common toxicities associated with these agents — remains poorly understood. This review aims to provide an overview of guidelines, antiemetic agents, and management steps for patients experiencing nausea and vomiting associated with the use of PARP inhibitors.

### Comparative trial of two intravenous doses of granisetron (1 versus 3 mg) in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced acute emesis: a double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial [^115YoPRN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). High credibility.

A single 3 mg or 40 μg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron combined with dexamethasone is routinely used in several countries, although the antiemetic guidelines have recommended granisetron at the dose of 1 mg or 10 μg/kg. A randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the optimal intravenous granisetron dose, 1 or 3 mg, in cancer patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 365 patients and randomly assigned them to receive intravenous granisetron 3 mg (3-mg group) or 1 mg (1-mg group), combined with dexamethasone at an adequate dose fixed as per the emetic risk category. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete response during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy.

- **Results**: The study demonstrated that 1 mg of granisetron was not inferior in effect to 3 mg. For the primary endpoint, 359 patients were evaluable according to the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Complete protection was achieved in the modified ITT population, 90.6% and 88.8% for the 3- and 1-mg groups, respectively (p < 0.01 for non-inferiority).

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that 1 mg granisetron is not inferior to 3 mg when both doses are combined with dexamethasone. Therefore, a 1-mg dose of intravenous granisetron should be the recommended prophylactic regimen for the prevention of acute emesis.

### Palonosetron plus dexamethasone versus granisetron plus dexamethasone for prevention of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy: a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, comparative phase III trial [^113Kccx4]. The Lancet. Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT(3))-receptor antagonist that has shown better efficacy than ondansetron and dolasetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and similar efficacy to ondansetron in preventing CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. In this phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, stratified, parallel-group, active-comparator trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of palonosetron versus granisetron for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, both of which were administered with dexamethasone in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: Between July 5, 2006, and May 31, 2007, 1,143 patients with cancer who were receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (i.e. cisplatin or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combination [AC/EC]) were recruited from 75 institutions in Japan and randomly assigned to either single-dose palonosetron (0.75 mg) or granisetron (40 microg/kg) 30 minutes before chemotherapy on day 1. Both were administered with dexamethasone (16 mg intravenously) on day 1, followed by additional doses (8 mg intravenously for patients receiving cisplatin or 4 mg orally for patients receiving AC/EC) on days 2 and 3. A non-deterministic minimisation method with a stochastic-biased coin was applied to the randomisation of patients. Covariates known to affect emetic risk, such as sex, age, and type of highly emetogenic chemotherapy, were used as stratification factors in minimisation to ensure balance between groups.

### Comparison of an extended-release formulation of granisetron (APF530) versus palonosetron for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority phase 3 trial [^113y9ygT]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, several large randomized trials have demonstrated that palonosetron is at least as effective as ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). However, in the trial, a new subcutaneous formulation of granisetron was noninferior to palonosetron — an agent broadly recommended as the preferred 5-HT 3 antagonist in treatment guidelines — in the control of acute CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC.

It has been postulated that the superiority of palonosetron over first-generation agents is due, in part, to its unique characteristics, including cooperative interactions with substance P and the NK-1 receptor pathway. Our findings of noninferiority of this granisetron formulation to palonosetron appear to question this hypothesis. From the results of this study, it appears that both APF530 and palonosetron provide good antiemetic control in the settings tested. Oral palonosetron was recently reported to be noninferior to palonosetron IV in preventing acute CINV in patients receiving MEC.

The convenience of a single subcutaneous injection of APF530 provides an alternative option to palonosetron IV for the prevention of CINV. Post hoc analyses may provide further insights into the efficacy of APF530 SC and the effects of sex, age, type of chemotherapy regimen administered, and prior therapies. Further studies may investigate the potential for APF530 in other clinical situations where sustained antiemetic activity is desired, such as during multiday chemotherapy, in patients receiving ra.

### Getting it right the first time: Recent progress in optimizing antiemetic usage [^116LsRUM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Several phase III trials directly compared palonosetron to either dolasetron, ondansetron, or granisetron in patients treated with MEC or HEC and demonstrated significantly higher efficacy in the acute and delayed phases in patients receiving palonosetron. A pooled analysis of palonosetron phase III trials confirmed significantly higher complete response (CR, no emesis, and no rescue antiemetics) rates in the delayed (57% vs. 45%; P < .0001) and overall period (51% vs. 40%; P < .0001) for palonosetron compared to the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Palonosetron also significantly decreased nausea severity in the delayed and overall periods. Based on these trials, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved palonosetron for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC.

In a phase III trial of APF530 versus palonosetron in over 1400 patients receiving MEC or HEC, APF530 was noninferior to palonosetron in preventing acute CINV after MEC or HEC and delayed CINV associated with MEC. A second phase III study compared APF530 to ondansetron, both in combination with fosaprepitant and dexamethasone, in patients receiving HEC. Delayed phase CR was significantly more common in patients receiving APF530 compared to the delayed phase CR found with ondansetron (65% vs. 57%; p = 0.014). The most common treatment-related adverse events were constipation, fatigue, headache, and infusion-site reactions.

### Are all 5-HT3 receptor antagonists the same [^112wmxZz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). High credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have become the cornerstone for preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Four 5-HT3 antagonists are commercially available in the United States, and numerous reports have been published comparing two or more agents. The studies ranged from randomized, double-blinded to open-label or retrospective trials; included chemotherapy-naïve and non-naïve patients; and covered a range of doses and routes of administration with and without concomitant steroids for preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy. With few exceptions, the studies uniformly show an equivalent efficacy rate and side effect profile among the various agents at equivalent doses.

This article reviews the pharmacology of the class for insight into minor differences among the agents that could possibly influence drug selection for certain patients, and considers data on the absorption, half-life, metabolism, and receptor activity. Clinical trials support the claim of various guidelines that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are therapeutically similar in safety and efficacy, particularly because the best practice for preventing nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy is a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, steroids, and aprepitant.

Regarding preventative measures for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, specifically in relation to prophylactic antiemetics for highly emetogenic radiotherapy, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend administering a two-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (5-HT3-RA) and dexamethasone. This should be done before each fraction and on the day after each fraction if radiotherapy is not planned for that day in adult patients treated with highly emetogenic radiotherapy.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^112LpYzd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, the efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m², was confirmed.

- **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period.

### MASCC antiemetic consensus recommendations: Resource-limited settings [^112qf3yr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

The prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains an essential supportive care need for patients receiving cancer treatment. Due to inadequate access to antiemetics in many countries, guideline-recommended CINV prophylaxis is not always possible. Our goal was to formulate antiemetic recommendations for resource-limited settings and define alternative antiemetic regimens for CINV prophylaxis after highly emetic chemotherapy (HEC) and moderately emetic chemotherapy (MEC) when NK1-receptor antagonists are not accessible.

- **Methods**: The recommendations based on the MASCC/ESMO 2023 Guideline Update were considered as the best option. The stratification based on a meta-analysis published by Filetti et al. (2023) was used to select and rank NK1-receptor antagonist-free regimens by their probability of achieving a complete response. Alternative NK1-receptor antagonist-free regimens based on olanzapine are proposed, ranked by their efficacy as "better" and "good" options when "best" regimens recommended by the MASCC/ESMO 2023 Guideline Update were not available or affordable.

- **Results**: For the prevention of acute CINV in patients receiving HEC (HEC-cisplatin and AC-HEC) with no access to an NK1-receptor antagonist, a 3-drug regimen including single doses of a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and olanzapine given before chemotherapy is recommended as an alternative option. Olanzapine and dexamethasone are recommended on days 2–4 after chemotherapy. The O10PD regimen (10 mg olanzapine, palonosetron, and dexamethasone) is suggested as the alternative.

### Consensus recommendations for the prevention of vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112DPBwz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In this update of our 2005 document, we used an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents for the prevention of emesis and nausea following anticancer chemotherapies of high emetic risk. A three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant beginning before chemotherapy and continuing for up to 4 days remains the standard of care.

We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. We conclude that, for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. In trials designed to prove the equivalence of palonosetron to ondansetron and granisetron, palonosetron proved superior in emesis prevention, while adverse effects were comparable. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration.

### 5-ht(3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^114xWFob]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment.

Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects and thus should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^112LiTN7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Complete response rates were significantly higher for palonosetron (pooled doses) relative to older 5HT 3 receptor antagonists (RAs) during the delayed phase (P < 0.0001) and the overall phase (P < 0.0001), but not during the acute phase (P = 0.091). Likewise, odds ratios (ORs, 95% CI) reflected a significantly greater likelihood of complete response with palonosetron versus older 5HT 3 RAs in the delayed (OR, 1.62 [1.40–1.88]) and overall phases (OR, 1.56 [1.34–1.81]), but not in the acute phase (OR, 1.15 [0.98–1.34]).

- **Complete response rates**: Significant differences between the palonosetron and other 5HT 3 RAs groups were observed in the delayed and overall phases. Complete response is defined as no emetic episodes and no usage of rescue medication. ✱ p < 0.0001, comparing palonosetron versus other 5HT 3 RAs.

- **Complete control rates**: Analysis of the complete control (CC) data showed that palonosetron provided higher CC rates than older 5HT 3 RAs in the delayed (P < 0.0001) and overall (P < 0.0001) phases, but not in the acute phase (P = 0.137). Odds ratios (95% CI) reinforced these findings. Complete control is defined as no emetic episodes, no usage of rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea. ✱ p < 0.0001, comparing palonosetron versus other 5HT 3 RAs.

### Emend [^112TLsNw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study involving 302 pediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), EMEND combined with ondansetron was compared to ondansetron alone (control regimen) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) (Study 5). Intravenous dexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen in both treatment groups, at the discretion of the physician. A 50% dose reduction of dexamethasone was required for patients in the EMEND group to account for a drug interaction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, no dexamethasone dose reduction was required for patients who received the control regimen.

Eligible patients had documented malignancy at either an original diagnosis or relapse and were scheduled to receive emetogenic chemotherapy or a chemotherapy regimen not previously tolerated due to vomiting, along with ondansetron as part of their antiemetic regimen.

Of the 152 pediatric patients randomized to receive the EMEND regimen, 55% were male, 45% female, 78% White, 7% Asian, 0% Black, 24% Hispanic, and 13% Multi-Racial. The most common primary malignancies in subjects receiving the EMEND regimen were osteosarcoma (11%), Ewing's sarcoma (11%), neuroblastoma (9%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (8%). Other commonly administered concomitant chemotherapy agents among EMEND patients included vincristine sulfate (65), etoposide (59), doxorubicin (48), ifosfamide (45), and carboplatin (39).

### Control of nausea with palonosetron versus granisetron, both combined with dexamethasone, in patients receiving cisplatin- or anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based regimens [^112NYGf9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Palonosetron (PALO) exhibits a longer half-life, more potent binding, and unique molecular interactions with the 5-HT3 receptor compared to first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (RAs). PALO allosterically binds to the 5-HT3 receptors with positive cooperativity, most likely triggering receptor internalization and leading to persistent inhibition of their function. Additionally, PALO can inhibit 5-HT3/NK1 receptor signaling cross-talk, mediating the prophylaxis of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), unlike first-generation 5-HT3 RAs. It has demonstrated efficacy in the prophylaxis of CINV during the acute and delayed phases, as well as overall, in various clinical studies. PALO has also shown greater effectiveness than dolasetron and ondansetron in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and outperforms ondansetron in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). Furthermore, a recent retrospective study involving nearly 10,000 patients with breast or lung cancer treated with carboplatin or cisplatin revealed that patients initiated and maintained on PALO experienced a significantly lower risk of CINV compared to those receiving first-generation 5-HT3 RAs. In a phase 3 comparative study of single-dose PALO and granisetron (GRA), both administered with dexamethasone and involving 1114 Japanese patients receiving HEC, Saito et al. found that PALO was non-inferior to GRA for controlling CINV in the acute phase and superior in the delayed phase.

When evaluating treatments to control CINV, risk factors for CINV should be considered. The efficacy of CINV prophylaxis can be influenced by the chemotherapeutic regimen and the patient.

### Low-dose granisetron for prophylaxis of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: A pilot study [^112Dvi2s]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (QTNV) are very uncomfortable symptoms for patients with cancer. These symptoms can often be circumvented with drug combinations containing serotonin receptor antagonists, such as granisetron. In an attempt to decrease the costs of QTNV prophylaxis, we studied a lower dose regimen of granisetron.

Sixty patients with cancer scheduled to receive moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy were pretreated one hour before with 0.5 mg of granisetron orally, combined with 20 mg of dexamethasone intravenously.

We observed complete control for nausea in 78% [95% confidence interval (CI), 67–89%], for vomiting in 61% (95% CI, 47.5–74.5%), and for both nausea and vomiting in 58% (95% CI, 44.3–71.7%) of the patients. This regimen was very well tolerated; headache (35%), xerostomia (11%), and constipation (5%) were the most frequent adverse symptoms reported.

The regimen with lower dose granisetron is effective for acute QTNV prophylaxis and offers a cheaper alternative for QTNV control. We feel that these encouraging results should be confirmed in a randomized comparative trial.

EVisual analog scale assessment of satisfaction: 0 = not at all satisfied, 100 = totally satisfied.

- **Re-treatment**: In uncontrolled trials, 127 patients receiving cisplatin (median dose, 100 mg/m²) and ondansetron who had two or fewer emetic episodes were re-treated with ondansetron and chemotherapy, mainly cisplatin, for a total of 269 re-treatment courses (median, 2; range, 1 to 10). No emetic episodes occurred in 160 patients (59%), and two or fewer emetic episodes occurred in 217 (81%) re-treatment courses.

- **Pediatrics**: Four open-label, noncomparative (one US, three foreign) trials were conducted with 209 pediatric cancer patients aged 4 to 18 years given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. In the three foreign trials, the initial dose of ondansetron injection ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg/kg for a total dose of 2.16 to 12 mg. This was followed by oral administration of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In the US trial, ondansetron was administered intravenously in three doses of 0.15 mg/kg each for a total daily dose of 7.2 to 39 mg. In these trials, 58% of the 196 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on Day 1. Thus, prevention of vomiting in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for patients older than 18 years.

An open-label, multicenter, noncomparative trial was conducted on 75 pediatric cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months receiving at least one moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic agent. Fifty-seven percent of the participants were female; 67% were white, and 18% were American Hispanic.

### Ondansetron has similar clinical efficacy against both nausea and vomiting [^114MyZ6G]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea. We analyzed data from 5,161 patients undergoing general anesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions, one of which was 4 mg ondansetron versus placebo. For the purpose of this study, a 20% difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant. Nausea was reduced from 38% (969/2,585) in the control group to 28% (715/2,576) in the ondansetron group, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74, or a relative risk reduction of 26%. Vomiting was reduced from 17% (441/2,585) to 11% (293/2,576), corresponding to a relative risk of 0.67, or a relative risk reduction of 33%. The relative risks of 0.67 and 0.74 were clinically similar, and the difference between them did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that ondansetron prevents postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting equally well.

### Granisetron hydrochloride [^117Nq787]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro.

In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known.

QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with other agents causing QT prolongation should be undertaken with caution.

### Comparison of an extended-release formulation of granisetron (APF530) versus palonosetron for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority phase 3 trial [^116orr5w]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The primary objectives were to establish, during cycle 1, the noninferiority of APF530 SC to palonosetron IV in preventing acute CINV (0–24 h) following MEC or HEC administration; the noninferiority of APF530 SC to palonosetron IV in preventing delayed CINV (24–120 h) following MEC administration; and the superiority of APF530 SC to palonosetron IV in preventing delayed CINV (24–120 h) following HEC administration. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of efficacy over the entire (0–120 h) period during cycle 1 and the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of APF530 SC.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR; no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medications) during the acute (0–24 h) and delayed (24–120 h) phases after chemotherapy cycle 1. Secondary endpoints included the safety and percentage of patients with CR over the entire (0–120 h) period during cycle 1, both of which are reported here. Other secondary endpoints (not reported) included percentages of patients with complete control (CC; CR with no more than mild nausea) and total response (TR; CR with no nausea) during the acute and delayed phases in cycle 1; assessment of APF530 SC pharmacokinetics in a subset of patients receiving MEC or HEC during cycle 1; and measurement of cardiac safety using electrocardiographic monitoring during cycle 1. Efficacy measures were determined from diaries, in which patients recorded emetic episodes, rescue medication, and severity of nausea for each 24-hour period after chemotherapy.

### Granisetron [^116QY76L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1; 5-HT1A; 5-HT1B/C; 5-HT2; for alpha1-, alpha2- or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D2; or for histamine-H1; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin; or opioid receptors.

Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds.

In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies.

Granisetron hydrochloride injection exhibited no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers.

### Consensus proposals for the prevention of acute and delayed vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112f6GBS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

This paper uses an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) antagonists. We conclude that for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration, even with chemotherapy of high emetic risk. Selective antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT(3)) in combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant are the standard of care for the prevention of emesis following chemotherapy of high emetic risk.

### Ondansetron [^1127RGEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m², was confirmed.

- **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the US with 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8-mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, followed by a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, and then 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^11223pYw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Efficacy was based on an "all-patients-treated" analysis. The median was undefined since at least 50% of the patients were rescued or experienced more than five emetic episodes.

- **Visual analog scale assessment of nausea**: 0 = no nausea, 100 = nausea as bad as it can be.
- **Visual analog scale assessment of satisfaction**: 0 = not at all satisfied, 100 = totally satisfied.

Ondansetron injection (0.15 mg/kg for three doses) was compared with metoclopramide (2 mg/kg for six doses) in a single-blind trial involving 307 patients receiving cisplatin ≥ 100 mg/m² with or without other chemotherapeutic agents. Patients received the first dose of either ondansetron or metoclopramide 30 minutes before cisplatin. Two additional ondansetron doses were administered 4 and 8 hours later, whereas five additional metoclopramide doses were given 2, 4, 7, 10, and 13 hours later. Cisplatin was administered over a period of 3 hours or less. Episodes of vomiting and retching were tabulated over the 24-hour period following cisplatin administration.

### Efficacy and tolerability of transdermal granisetron for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately and highly emetogenic multi-day chemotherapy: A randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^113HHpBP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The study was carried out between January and October 2006. Of 715 patients assessed for eligibility, 641 were randomized to receive the GTDS (n = 318) or oral granisetron (n = 323). Of these patients, 637 were in the SS, 621 were in the FAS, and 582 were in the PPS; reasons for withdrawal were similar between the two treatment groups. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics, including stratification variables, were comparable between the two treatment groups. Baseline characteristics in the SS and PPS were similar to the FAS. Prophylactic use of corticosteroids was well balanced between the two arms (GTDS group, 61.0%; placebo group, 61.7%). In the FAS, 71% of GTDS patients and 72% of oral granisetron patients received regimens containing one or more days of cisplatin.

- **Flow of participants through the study**: SS refers to all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment. FAS includes all SS patients who had ≥ 1 efficacy assessment after the start of chemotherapy. PPS includes all FAS patients without protocol violations that directly impinged on or affected the primary endpoint. Protocol violations leading to exclusion from the PPS comprised changes in the planned chemotherapy regimen, receipt of banned concomitant medications, > 50% patch detachment, and incorrect study drug administration.

### Potential role of the NK1 receptor antagonists in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [^115hTTdo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Better tolerated and more effective means of controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have been introduced over the past decade. Despite the progress made, incompletely controlled emesis is a persistent problem for significant numbers of patients receiving chemotherapy. Efforts to improve antiemetic control further are ongoing. The most interesting new class of antiemetics under development focuses on antagonism of the neurotransmitter substance P. Substance P exerts its effects by binding to the tachykinin neurokinin NK1 receptor.

A number of selective antagonists of the NK1 receptor have been synthesized and, when used in preclinical models, have demonstrated an ability to antagonize the emetic effects of a number of stimuli, including chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin. Over the past three years, results of the initial studies evaluating this class of agents for cisplatin-induced emesis in cancer patients have begun to appear. These agents have been well tolerated. As single agents, they appear to be no more effective than 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing acute cisplatin-induced emesis. Their real value may be found in combination with existing agents and in the treatment of delayed emesis. The results of ongoing clinical trials will hopefully define the utility and appropriate place for this new class of agents in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

### Oral ondansetron is highly active as rescue antiemetic treatment for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy: results of a randomized phase II study [^112xhqMY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

In the present phase II randomized study, two different schedules of ondansetron were investigated as rescue antiemetic treatment for delayed emesis related to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).

- **Materials and methods**: Patients scheduled to receive a first course of MEC were randomized to ondansetron 8 mg intramuscularly (arm A) or ondansetron 16 mg orally (arm B) as rescue antiemetic treatment for delayed emesis. Efficacy and safety evaluation was performed from days 2 to 6 through the administration of a diary and a questionnaire in which the emetic episodes and the use of the assigned rescue treatment were recorded. All patients received standard prophylaxis for delayed emesis with oral dexamethasone 8 mg daily for 4 days starting on day 2.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, with 44 randomized to arm A and 45 to arm B. Twenty-two patients in each arm developed grade 1–2 delayed nausea/vomiting, all of which recurred to the rescue study treatment. Oral ondansetron proved superior to intramuscular ondansetron in terms of complete response for nausea (77.3% vs. 40.9%, respectively, p = 0.01) and vomiting (81.8% vs. 31.8%, respectively, p = 0.001). Both schedules were very well tolerated, with no differences in toxicity observed between the two treatment arms. Furthermore, personal satisfaction with the assigned rescue study medication was significantly higher in arm B.

Due to its high efficacy and excellent tolerability, oral ondansetron is an important option in the management of MEC.

### Apokyn [^116buNkM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Apokyn is contraindicated in patients using concomitant drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class, including antiemetics such as ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. There have been reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when Apokyn was administered with ondansetron. Additionally, patients with hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to apomorphine or any of the excipients of Apokyn, including sulfites like sodium metabisulfite, should not use this medication. Angioedema or anaphylaxis may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^112oMcZM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis: For this analysis, data from patients treated with ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron were pooled, and all data from patients treated with palonosetron were pooled. Because the older 5HT3 RAs have similar efficacy in preventing CINV when administered at therapeutically equivalent doses, pooling of the data for these agents was considered valid. Similarly, as there are few differences in efficacy between the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron, pooling of data for the two doses was also considered valid.

A logistic regression model was used to analyze pooled data from the four phase III trials. This model was fitted for CR and CC endpoints with terms for palonosetron 0.25, palonosetron 0.75, HEC, MEC, and the Japanese study. A goodness-of-fit test (Hosmer–Lemeshow) was applied to ensure consistency of the endpoint effect across various strata of variables in the model. Interaction terms were assessed for significance; nonsignificant terms were removed from the model, which was then refitted. Model-fit and goodness-of-fit tests were reapplied in this iterative process until all nonsignificant variables were eliminated or the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test indicated a poor model fit.

This process was also repeated for subgroups of patients with lung cancer or breast cancer. For descriptive purposes, if both the model-fit and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests were statistically significant, it suggested poor model fit across the dataset.

### Single-dose oral granisetron versus multidose intravenous ondansetron for moderately emetogenic cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in pediatric outpatients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111qhcn1]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

This prospective study was designed to compare the efficacy of ondansetron with granisetron in terms of complete emesis control and time spent in an ambulatory care setting in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing moderately emetogenic cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. The costs for both treatments are also examined.

A total of 33 children (mean age: 7.8 ± 4.9 years) were studied during 66 chemotherapy cycles. Analysis was based on 33 courses of a single oral dose of granisetron and 33 courses of ondansetron, incorporating two intravenous doses of ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg followed by one dose of the same dosage orally. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of overall efficacy (McNemar's chi-square test).

Twenty of 33 patients (60.6%) receiving granisetron and 15 of 33 patients (45.5%) receiving ondansetron experienced no emesis 24 hours after chemotherapy (p = .227). Boys experienced greater rates of vomiting than girls despite antiemetic treatment; however, no apparent reason for the gender discrepancy was noted. Both antiemetic regimens have similar efficacy for treating the moderately emetogenic effects associated with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. It is possible that the granisetron regimen may be preferable because it is simpler to administer and more cost-effective.

### Efficacy and tolerability of transdermal granisetron for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately and highly emetogenic multi-day chemotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^113CGKKF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy analysis met its predefined primary endpoint. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the treatments was greater than −15%, indicating that the granisetron transdermal system (GTDS) was non-inferior relative to oral granisetron. The number of patients in the per-protocol set (PPS) who achieved complete control (CC) of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) during the post-chemotherapy emergency period (PEEP) was 193 (65%) in the oral granisetron group and 171 (60%) in the GTDS group. This equates to an estimated difference in percentage CC between the groups of 5% (95% CI, −13 to 3).

Secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses involved examining CC in predefined subgroups of the PPS, based on known CINV risk factors. These analyses showed no significant differences between the GTDS and oral granisetron in any subgroup. This indicates that the results of the primary efficacy analysis are consistent across these predefined subgroups. Additionally, analysis of CC in the full analysis set (FAS) gave similar results to those obtained in the PPS. The results of these exploratory analyses, therefore, support the conclusion of non-inferiority of the GTDS relative to oral granisetron.

The percentage of patients in the PPS who achieved complete response (CR) and total control (TC) during the PEEP is shown. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of patients achieving CR and TC in the two treatment groups.

### Getting it right the first time: Recent progress in optimizing antiemetic usage [^117FKN3z]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Netupitant and NEPA preclinical studies revealed synergistic activity for netupitant and palonosetron (NEPA) that, coupled with the unique pharmacologic features of palonosetron, suggested that this combination could be highly effective against CINV. A pivotal phase II trial examined multiple dosing combinations of these two agents versus palonosetron alone or an exploratory arm of aprepitant and ondansetron in 694 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. All the patients receiving NEPA were significantly more likely to achieve a CR compared to those receiving palonosetron alone in the delayed and overall phases (89.6% vs. 76.5%; p = 0.004). NEPA at a netupitant dose of 300 mg (NEPA300) significantly improved the rates of CR, no emesis, no significant nausea, and complete protection (CR plus no significant nausea) in the acute, delayed, and overall phases compared to palonosetron. An oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant (300 mg) and palonosetron (0.5 mg) was subsequently developed to provide a convenient antiemetic therapy that combined a 5-HT3 and NK-1 receptor antagonist as suggested by CINV guidelines.

A subsequent randomized phase III trial directly compared a single dose of NEPA to a single dose of oral palonosetron (0.5 mg), both with dexamethasone, in 1455 patients receiving AC-based chemotherapy. NEPA significantly increased the CR rate compared to palonosetron during the delayed phase (76.9% vs. 69.5%; p = 0.001), acute phase (88.4% vs. 85.0%; p = 0.047), and overall (74.3% vs. 66.6%; p = 0.001). NEPA provided more protection than palonosetron alone.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^115zAFmt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

This analysis of pooled patient-level data from four multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blind, comparative trials demonstrates that palonosetron has a safety profile similar to that of older 5HT3 RAs but provides superior prophylaxis of CINV. Palonosetron demonstrated significantly higher complete response (CR) and complete control (CC) rates than older 5HT3 RAs (ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron) during the delayed (> 24–120 h) and overall (0–120 h) postchemotherapy periods. The number of emetic episodes and severity of nausea were also significantly different for palonosetron compared with older 5HT3 RAs.

The most noteworthy differences between palonosetron and older 5HT3 RAs occurred in the delayed phase and throughout the overall 5-day evaluation period. Palonosetron therefore provides an effective option for delayed onset CINV, an effect of chemotherapy that previously had been more difficult to manage due to the limited efficacy of older 5HT3 RAs in this context. Further, palonosetron may be more effective in controlling nausea (particularly delayed nausea), which remains a challenge despite the antiemetic efficacy of the older 5HT3 RAs. The observed advantage of palonosetron in efficacy during the delayed phase may be explained by differences in binding characteristics of palonosetron, such as a longer elimination half-life relative to other 5HT3 RAs and triggering of receptor internalization leading to prolonged inhibition of receptor function and NK1 cross talk. All of the studies evaluated outcomes following a single dose of palonosetron.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^112Fdeks]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting**:

	- In two randomized, double-blind, monotherapy trials, a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron was shown to be superior to a relevant historical placebo control in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m². It is important to note that steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients who received a cisplatin dose of 50 mg/m² or greater in the historical placebo comparator group experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.

	- The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron: 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for two doses, and 32 mg as a single dose, in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin at doses of 50 mg/m² or greater. The first or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Of the patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 66% completed the 24-hour trial period with zero emetic episodes and no need for rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Similarly, 55% of patients in both the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group and the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group also met this endpoint. Each of the three treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant superiority to a historical placebo control.

### Granisetron [^116CEZzv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. Although definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs have not been conducted, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications, which are commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. As granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. Additionally, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4, involved in the metabolism of some primary narcotic analgesic agents, is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro.

In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited the ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known.

QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride.
