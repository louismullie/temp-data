## Question

Does having chronic hepatitis C disqualify you for use of pre-exposure prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic hepatitis C disqualifies someone from using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labels and major guidelines list as absolute contraindications. Then, I should verify whether CDC PrEP guidance names chronic HCV as an exclusion. Next, I will check key PrEP trials for HCV-related exclusions. After that, I need to review AASLD/IDSA HCV guidance for coinfection management and drug–drug interactions with PrEP options. Finally, I will consider practical monitoring and how to coordinate HCV treatment alongside PrEP without interruption.

> Let me first confirm the labeled contraindications and eligibility. The Apretude (cabotegravir) and Descovy (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) PrEP labels list unknown or positive HIV-1 status as the contraindication and require a negative HIV test and weight at least 35 kg prior to initiation; neither label lists chronic hepatitis C infection as a contraindication, which supports that HCV alone does not disqualify PrEP use [^115QP88j] [^1165Q2mD]. I should also check the CDC PrEP guideline language, and it likewise recommends PrEP for persons at substantial HIV risk without naming chronic HCV as an exclusion [^1152SxG8] [^111GC8bR].

> Wait, let me verify that I am not conflating hepatitis B and C considerations. The prominent liver-related warning on tenofovir/emtricitabine products is for HBV reactivation after discontinuation, which is an HBV issue and not a reason to withhold PrEP for patients with chronic HCV; the key safety action is to recognize and manage HBV if present, not to exclude HCV from PrEP eligibility [^116iXobp] [^1165Q2mD].

> Next, I should review whether major PrEP trials treated chronic HCV as a disqualifier. In the PROUD study, participants with active or indicated treatment for hepatitis B were excluded, but hepatitis C infection was not an exclusion criterion, and subsequent analyses documented HCV infections during follow-up without suggesting that baseline HCV precluded PrEP participation [^112DpHLs] [^11155NvZ] [^112n9A4T].

> Hold on, I should verify what hepatology guidelines say about coinfection and antiretroviral use. The AASLD/IDSA HCV guidance advises treating and retreating HCV in people with HIV similarly to those without HIV after accounting for drug interactions, and it explicitly advises not interrupting antiretroviral therapy to allow HCV therapy, which aligns with a concurrent, not exclusionary, approach to HIV prevention and HCV care [^111cwn4m] [^114zzG98] [^116HLJpC].

> I will now examine drug–drug interaction and monitoring nuances that matter when HCV therapy and PrEP overlap. For tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimens, renal monitoring is prudent with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and pharmacokinetic boosters and avoidance is recommended if eGFR is less than 60 mL/min; consideration of switching to tenofovir alafenamide can mitigate exposure when cobicistat or ritonavir are present, while certain DAA combinations such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or elbasvir/grazoprevir are compatible with many modern antiretrovirals; additionally, voxilaprevir with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors or elvitegravir/cobicistat warrants hepatotoxicity monitoring, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir should be avoided with specific antiretrovirals listed in guidance [^116i2cGq] [^1111wMcU] [^1169WAKX] [^113LuPfS] [^116rFJeS] [^117Tptor] [^111k1zPR] [^113u6WK5].

> Let me consider ongoing monitoring while on PrEP to ensure safety and early detection issues are addressed. CDC recommends confirming HIV-negative status at initiation and at least every 3 months with oral PrEP and about every 4 months with injectable cabotegravir, and standard PrEP care includes renal function assessment for tenofovir-based regimens; integrating periodic HCV screening for higher-risk populations within these visits is reasonable and supported by modeling and implementation data highlighting the value of regular HCV testing among PrEP users [^114NFSLk] [^116aSVRy] [^115NEPCT] [^1152YmPZ] [^115xK4S5].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly: chronic hepatitis C is not a contraindication to HIV PrEP, and individuals with chronic HCV who are at risk for HIV should be offered PrEP with attention to baseline and ongoing HIV testing, renal and hepatic considerations, and coordination of HCV therapy to avoid interactions; HCV treatment should proceed and antiretroviral prevention should not be interrupted, with regimen choices individualized based on comorbidities and potential drug–drug interactions [^115QP88j] [^1165Q2mD] [^114NFSLk] [^111cwn4m] [^114zzG98].

---

No, chronic hepatitis C **does not disqualify** a person from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is indicated for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk, **regardless of HCV status** [^116aSVRy]. PrEP regimens (TDF/FTC, TAF/FTC [^1165Q2mD], cabotegravir) [^115QP88j] are **safe and effective in HCV-infected individuals**, with no clinically significant interactions with HCV direct-acting antivirals such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir [^113LuPfS], sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. PrEP users with chronic HCV should have baseline and periodic renal and hepatic monitoring, and HCV treatment should be coordinated with PrEP care [^1167a8RR] [^117Tptor]. PrEP should be paused only if severe renal impairment or advanced liver disease develops, **not due to HCV alone**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current CDC [^116aSVRy] and WHO guidance states that chronic hepatitis C is **not a contraindication to PrEP**. The CDC's 2021 guideline [^116aSVRy] explicitly recommends PrEP for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk of HIV acquisition [^111GC8bR], regardless of HCV status. Similarly, WHO supports PrEP for people at high risk of HIV acquisition, including those with chronic HCV infection.

---

## Safety and efficacy of PrEP in individuals with chronic hepatitis C

PrEP regimens — tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC), and cabotegravir — have been extensively studied and are **safe and effective** in individuals with chronic HCV infection. They do not have clinically significant interactions with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) used to treat HCV, such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir [^113LuPfS], sofosbuvir/velpatasvir [^11256z6R], or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir [^111k1zPR] [^116rFJeS]. However, individuals with chronic HCV infection may have an **increased risk of renal impairment**, particularly with TDF-containing regimens; accordingly, regular renal function monitoring is recommended [^1111wMcU] [^1167a8RR].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

Although chronic HCV does not preclude PrEP use, clinicians should be aware of the following considerations and potential risks:

- **Renal impairment**: Chronic HCV infection can increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly with TDF-containing regimens. Regular renal function monitoring is recommended [^1111wMcU] [^116i2cGq].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Individuals with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may require careful monitoring and dose adjustments due to potential hepatic impairment [^117Tptor].

- **Drug interactions**: Although no significant interactions have been identified between PrEP medications and DAAs, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential interactions, especially in patients with complex medication regimens [^113u6WK5].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

Healthcare providers should follow these clinical management and monitoring steps when prescribing PrEP to individuals with chronic HCV infection:

- **Baseline assessment**: Conduct baseline renal and hepatic function tests before initiating PrEP.

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor renal and hepatic function regularly during PrEP use, particularly in individuals with advanced liver disease or renal impairment.

- **HCV treatment coordination**: Coordinate HCV treatment with PrEP use, ensuring that any potential drug interactions or side effects are managed appropriately [^116HLJpC].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about the importance of adherence to both PrEP and HCV treatment regimens, as well as the need for regular monitoring and follow-up appointments [^115cDX9H].

---

## Clinical scenarios where PrEP may be contraindicated or require caution

Although chronic HCV alone does not preclude PrEP use, certain clinical scenarios warrant caution or additional monitoring:

- **Severe renal impairment**: PrEP regimens containing TDF are contraindicated in individuals with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min). Alternative regimens or dose adjustments may be necessary.

- **Advanced liver disease**: Individuals with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may require careful monitoring and dose adjustments due to potential hepatic impairment.

- **Concurrent medications**: Patients taking multiple medications, particularly those with potential renal or hepatic toxicity, may require additional monitoring and management [^113LuPfS] [^111k1zPR].

---

Chronic hepatitis C infection **does not disqualify individuals from using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)** [^116aSVRy]. PrEP is safe and effective for individuals with chronic HCV infection, but regular monitoring of renal and hepatic function is recommended [^1167a8RR]. Healthcare providers should consider potential risks and interactions, and manage PrEP use accordingly [^114NFSLk].

### Expanding knowledge about implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): A methodological review [^1124NvTB]. AIDS and Behavior (2019). Low credibility.

In order to include articles published through the end of 2018, we attempted to update our search in January 2019. Unfortunately, in the interim, the database system, ArticlesPlus, on which we had conducted our original search, was discontinued by the University of Michigan. Therefore, we conducted our updated search using the new University of Michigan search interface, which consolidated ArticlesPlus with other library search interfaces. To meet the parameters of this new search tool, our search terms needed to be altered slightly to limit operators and parenthetical clauses included within search term categories. The following updated search was conducted on January 13, 2019: [subject:HIV OR HIV/AIDS OR AIDS AND title:PrEP OR "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis" AND all_fields:linkage* OR linking OR referral* OR implementation OR uptake] OR [subject:HIV OR HIV/AIDS OR AIDS AND title:antiretroviral* OR pharmaceutical* AND prevent* AND all_fields:linkage* OR linking OR referral* OR implementation OR uptake]

Compared to our original search, which yielded 196 articles between 2007 and June 2018, this consolidated search tool yielded many more results. The search generated 340 articles published between 2007 and 2018, with 144 articles published in 2018 alone. We conducted a preliminary review based on titles and abstracts, eliminating 217 articles that did not meet inclusion criteria. The remaining 123 articles were then subjected to a full-text review, at which point we were able to eliminate an additional 44 articles that did not meet inclusion criteria.

### US guideline criteria for human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis: Clinical considerations and caveats [^116WvXJc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been instrumental in the implementation of PrEP in medical practices throughout the country. However, the eligibility criteria contained within may inadvertently limit PrEP access for some patients.

- **Key considerations and caveats**: We describe the following aspects related to these criteria: promotion of a selective versus universal approach to sexual health education involving PrEP; misalignment between criteria stated in the table and text boxes; problematic categorization and confounding of sexual orientation, gender identity, and risk behavior. Additionally, there is an underemphasis of network/community-level drivers of HIV transmission, oversimplification of serodiscordant risk, and a lack of clarity surrounding the relevance of condoms to PrEP eligibility.

- **Recommendations**: We offer concrete recommendations to address the identified issues and strengthen future iterations of the guidelines. These recommendations are applied in an alternative table of "criteria".

### HIV preexposure prophylaxis: The role of primary care clinicians in ending the HIV epidemic [^1133KYu1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic persists despite data supporting multiple effective and safe tools that prevent HIV transmission and acquisition. Human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-uninfected at-risk populations using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate emtricitabine is highly effective and safe, and it is recently endorsed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as a grade A recommendation. In this Special Communication, we summarize guidelines and expert recommendations in a call for wider adoption of PrEP prescribing activities by frontline primary care clinicians.

- **Components include**: the ideal contexts in which PrEP may be prescribed, eligibility criteria, clinical considerations and pitfalls, laboratory monitoring, prescription practices, situations that may warrant expert consultation, and future directions.

Given the broad scope, access, and point-of-entry status of primary clinicians in health systems, generalists will need to be at the center of any successful effort to leverage the power of and destigmatize PrEP to end the HIV epidemic.

### Incidence of hepatitis C virus infections among users of human immunodeficiency virus pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1152SxG8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is well documented among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals. The use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be associated with engagement in activities that facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and possibly HCV among PrEP users.

- **Methods**: Between 2012 and 2019, the incidence of HCV and bacterial STIs were calculated among HIV-negative individuals receiving PrEP at the University Health Network HIV Prevention Clinic. Mucosal, anal, and blood samples were taken to test for HIV, syphilis, and anti-HCV antibodies.

- **Results**: Among 344 HIV-uninfected patients receiving PrEP, 86% were men having sex with men (MSM). Five individuals were HCV-antibody positive at the time of PrEP initiation. Serologic and virologic follow-up data were available for 109 HCV-negative individuals over 282 patient-years (PY). Two new infections were recorded, yielding an incidence of primary HCV infection of 0.7 per 100 PY. In contrast with HCV, the incidence rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis were 49.2 per 100 PY, 36.3 per 100 PY, and 5.2 per 100 PY, respectively. Both individuals with new HCV diagnoses reported being MSM with a history of unprotected intercourse, and one individual also reported recreational drug use. Both individuals were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the infections were detected by routine laboratory monitoring.

- **Conclusions**: The low incidence of HCV infections despite significantly higher rates of other STIs suggests that sexual transmission is less common.

### Preferences for pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV: A systematic review of discrete choice experiments [^113ytUeJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medications by people without HIV and offers up to 99% protection against HIV infection when taken as prescribed. HIV PrEP benefits individuals and, by reducing HIV transmission, potentially benefits the population level as well. Due to its proven benefits, PrEP was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV as part of combination HIV prevention approaches. This was updated in 2019 to include the recommendation on event-driven or on-demand PrEP, and in 2021 on vaginal ring PrEP.

Levels of PrEP access are not sufficient to significantly affect the course of the HIV pandemic. Despite strong evidence on the benefits of PrEP, and a commitment by the United Nations to have 3 million people at high risk of HIV infection accessing PrEP by 2020, it is estimated that 927,277 were using PrEP at the end of 2020. In Q3 of 2021, the figure had increased to 1,544,777, with the majority of users located in the Americas (42%) and Africa (34%). Furthermore, while the intention is for PrEP to be used dynamically in accordance with risk (i.e. particularly to be used during periods of risk), a systematic review reported that at least one-third of PrEP users had discontinued PrEP within six months. Several barriers were noted at the individual and structural levels, such as internalized stigma about risk behaviors (including stigma towards key populations and personal feelings of shame about having condomless sex).

### Low incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in two cohorts of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis adherence interventions in men who have sex with men in Southern California [^111Zk2yH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been associated with incident hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in men who have sex with men (MSM) due to decreased condom use. We examined rates of HCV among MSM and transgender women at high risk of HIV on PrEP in Southern California using data from two trials (NCT01761643 and NCT01781806).

Five of 599 participants (0.84%, 95% CI, 0.27–1.93) had HCV antibodies detected at entry. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity included being older (p = .002) and having a lower education level (p < .001). HCV-positive participants had no reported cases of sexually transmitted infections (rectal, urethral, or pharyngeal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia) at entry, while HCV-negative participants had a prevalence of 18% (95% CI, 15%-21%).

There were no significant differences in substance use and sexual risk behavior between HCV-positive and HCV-negative participants 1–3 months prior to entry. Among early PrEP adopters, incident HCV did not occur despite ongoing condomless intercourse. Screening intervals for HCV in MSM on PrEP should be led by a risk behavior assessment.

### Update to interim guidance for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection: PrEP for injecting drug users [^113ZDfy1]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). High credibility.

On June 12, 2013, the Thailand Ministry of Health and CDC published results from a randomized controlled trial of a daily oral dose of 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) that showed efficacy in reducing the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs). Based on these findings, CDC recommends that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) be considered as one of several prevention options for persons at very high risk for HIV acquisition through the injection of illicit drugs.

### The risk of HIV drug resistance following implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114ucTsa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010).

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the results of trials determining whether pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral drugs prevents the transmission of HIV. Tenofovir and emtricitabine, currently being evaluated as PrEP, are popular in the treatment of HIV. Drug resistance could, therefore, be critical in the use of PrEP. We review the literature regarding risks associated with drug resistance owing to PrEP.

Few studies have addressed the issue of drug resistance to tenofovir and/or emtricitabine. Studies in HIV-1-infected individuals followed small numbers of patients for a short time. Studies in macaques were well-designed but used SHIV, which has an attenuated course of infection. The available information suggests that the probability of the emergence of drug resistance is small. Infections that occurred despite the use of PrEP had reduced peak viremia, which could reduce HIV transmissibility. Mathematical modeling suggests that, although transmitted drug resistance may, under some circumstances, increase, the benefits of PrEP outweigh the risks associated with resistance.

Tenofovir and emtricitabine are recommended in first-line treatment. The potentially limited impact of drug resistance should, therefore, be confirmed in daily practice. Surveillance of drug resistance is recommended in areas where PrEP is used. Patients who became infected despite the use of PrEP should be closely monitored for virological failure.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^116ifXYJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Impact of PrEP on HCV**: Due to the switch to DAA therapies from 2015, HCV incidence will decrease by 42.1% (95% CR 20.8%−61.9%) over 2018–2030, even without the introduction of PrEP or enhanced HCV screening, and overall HCV prevalence will decrease by 32.6% (95% CR 20.5–44.4%) due mainly to a 62.2% (95% CR 50.8–71.2%) decrease in HCV prevalence in HIV-diagnosed MSM. With 12.5% coverage of PrEP, an additional small decrease in HCV incidence occurs (by 45.1% (95% CR 16.8–67.2%) – Fig. 1 and Table 2) if sexual behaviors remain unchanged (S0) and HCV screening remains the same. This decrease is due to PrEP reducing the number of HIV-infected MSM, among whom HCV is concentrated, thus translating to fewer HIV/HCV co-infections. Interestingly, the HCV prevalence and incidence among HIV-negative MSM using PrEP are both about 3-fold higher than other HIV-negative MSM due to many PrEP users being high-risk (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, although HIV-positive MSM and MSM on PrEP have the highest prevalence of HCV, HIV-negative MSM not using PrEP on average harbor 73.1% of all HCV infections (Supplementary Fig. S4).

- **Projections of HCV**: Fig. 1 shows projections of HCV (A) prevalence and (B) incidence among different subgroups of MSM by 2030 for the baseline 'no PrEP' scenario and due to the introduction of PrEP both with and without risk compensation. The projections assume 12.5% coverage of PrEP in HIV-negative MSM and no additional HCV screening. The risk compensation scenario assumes condom use among PrEP users reduces from 68% to 34%. Point estimates are the median of our model projections.

Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves the use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-negative individuals to prevent HIV infection. In 2015, the WHO released new guidelines recommending PrEP for all populations at substantial risk of HIV infection. To prepare these guidelines, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the values and preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP. These populations include women, heterosexual men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and healthcare providers who may prescribe PrEP.

A comprehensive search strategy reviewed three electronic databases of articles and HIV-related conference abstracts from January 1990 to April 2015. Data abstraction was conducted using standardized forms to categorize by population groups and relevant themes. Out of 3068 citations screened, 76 peer-reviewed articles and 28 conference abstracts were included, covering a global geographic scope. Most studies (N = 78) evaluated hypothetical use of PrEP, while 26 studies involved individuals who actually took PrEP or a placebo.

Awareness of PrEP was generally low; however, once presented with information about PrEP, the majority indicated they would consider using it. Concerns about safety, side effects, cost, and effectiveness were the most frequently cited barriers to use, with little indication of risk compensation. Healthcare providers expressed willingness to prescribe PrEP but indicated a need for more information before doing so. Findings from a rapidly expanding evidence base suggest that the majority of populations most likely to benefit from PrEP are receptive to its use.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114q6M8M]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

Characteristics of the 544 study participants have been previously described. Figure 1 illustrates the hepatitis C screening and infection among study participants. One hundred and thirty-three (24.4%) participants were screened for HCV at enrolment, and 499 (91.7%) were tested at least once during follow-up. Nine participants were only screened at baseline and therefore could not contribute to an incidence analysis. An HCV screen was conducted at 54.0% (3213/5946) of visits, with higher screening rates during the phase of routine quarterly screening (80.6%) compared to the earlier phase of testing on indication (34.9%). The median number of screens per participant was six (IQR: 3–8). Of the 45 participants who were never tested, 14 were also missing information on HCV history collected at enrolment.

- **Figure 1 description**: Hepatitis C screening and infection consort diagram. Seroprevalent infections are indicated by a dashed box, and incidence infections are indicated by a double-lined box. TMG stands for Trial Management Group.

- **Hepatitis C seroprevalence at enrolment**: The seroprevalence at enrolment was 2.1% (11/530; 95% CI: 1.0%-3.7%). The 11 cases were identified as follows: eight participants were reported by the clinician at enrolment to have had a previous diagnosis of HCV; two were diagnosed with HCV a few days before enrolment; two participants had HCV viraemia detected at their first post-enrolment test (they were not tested at enrolment), and one of these was judged to have acquired the infection before enrolment.

### Real-world eligibility for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis among people who inject drugs [^11122ShJ]. AIDS and Behavior (2020). Low credibility.

Recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of and willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID); however, knowledge of real-world applicability is limited. We aimed to quantify the real-world eligibility for HIV-PrEP among HIV-negative PWID in Montreal, Canada (n = 718). Eligibility was calculated according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and compared to the risk of HIV acquisition according to the Assessing the Risk of Contracting HIV (ARCH-IDU) risk screening tool. Over one-third of participants (37%) were eligible for HIV PrEP, with one-third of these eligible due to sexual risk alone. Half of the participants were considered high risk of HIV acquisition according to ARCH-IDU, but there was poor agreement between the two measures. Although a large proportion of PWID were eligible for HIV-PrEP, better tools that are context- and location-informed are needed to identify PWID at higher risk of HIV acquisition.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection (PROUD): Effectiveness results from the pilot phase of a pragmatic open-label randomised trial [^112DpHLs]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

We conducted this pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 13 sexual health clinics in England. Eligible participants were male at birth, aged 18 years or older, had previously attended the enrolling clinic, had been screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, were HIV negative by a routinely used assay in the previous 4 weeks or on the day of enrolment, and had reported anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days and likely expected to do so in the next 90 days. We excluded participants with acute viral illness possibly due to HIV seroconversion, any contraindication to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or emtricitabine, and those being treated with or indicated for treatment of hepatitis B infection. The study was reviewed and approved by the London Bridge Research Ethics Committee. All patients provided written informed consent.

We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive PrEP either starting at the enrolment visit (immediate group) or following a deferral period of 1 year (deferred group). The computer-generated randomisation list with variable block sizes (of four, six, and eight; stratified by clinical site) was prepared by one of the trial statisticians and incorporated within the database held at the coordinating centre. Randomisation was web-based and done by approved members of the research team at each clinic. Regular sexual partners were encouraged to enrol together.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114Serzz]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Previous modelling has considered what is required to eliminate HCV among HIV-diagnosed MSM, but none have accounted for the HCV transmission dynamics among HIV-negative MSM. In this study, we use modelling to determine what HCV testing and treatment strategies are needed to reduce the overall incidence of HCV among MSM by 90% by 2030 in the UK. We assess how PrEP and any associated changes in condom use may affect the impact achieved, and determine the need for HCV screening among PrEP users and other HIV-negative MSM to help inform future policy and guidelines.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^112n9A4T]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

In general, HIV‐negative men who have sex with men (MSM) have been considered to be at low risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HIV‐negative MSM who access pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have reported sexual behaviors that could place them at high risk of HCV, including high partner numbers, chemsex, and injecting drug use. Early diagnosis of HCV infection allows early linkage to treatment and care, thereby reducing onward transmission of infection. Data from European PrEP trials and cohort studies of PrEP users have reported high baseline HCV prevalence and incidence during follow‐up. In contrast, studies from North America have generally found low levels of HCV endemicity among PrEP users.

The PROUD study was an open‐label trial of HIV PrEP among 544 HIV‐negative MSM. As there were no data on HCV incidence in HIV‐negative MSM using PrEP in the UK, we implemented routine quarterly screening during the long‐term follow‐up phase when all participants had access to PrEP. We report HCV prevalence and incidence among participants in the PROUD study.

### The future of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention: A global qualitative consultation on provider perspectives on new products and differentiated service delivery [^114kEwRB]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). High credibility.

Some clients struggle with risk assessment and do not understand the pharmacokinetics, making it difficult to convince them that daily PrEP is the best protection. In these cases, an injection will be much easier for both the provider and the client.

It is challenging to maintain the motivation to adhere to a daily pill without an HIV diagnosis. Client enthusiasm for an injectable and long-acting option is considered an important facilitator for the uptake of PrEP. Several providers noted that clients are already asking for this product. Some providers mentioned that many people already have experience with injectables for other healthcare needs.

Cabotegravir is a novel concept within PrEP, but it is not a novel concept in general, as it refers to injectable contraception and medications for a range of health issues. It is a creative way to help prevent new cases of HIV transmission.

Personal preferences are an important determinant of PrEP uptake, and providers emphasized the need to preserve choice. Some people are afraid of injections, so both options must be available. CAB-LA is not the answer to all the problems, but it is a very useful new means of prophylaxis.

Most providers felt that CAB-LA would be difficult to deliver in non-clinic settings due to the reliance on physicians or nurses to administer injections and review complex health issues or drug interactions.

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^1129nBLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

More than 30 years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 2.7 million people becoming infected every year. There is a need for HIV prevention strategies that are more effective. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of oral antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in HIV-uninfected high-risk individuals.

- **Search methods**: We revised the search strategy from the previous version of the review and conducted an updated search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE in April 2012. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent or combination of antiretroviral agents in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect.

- **Main results**: We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that met the criteria for the review. Six were ongoing trials, four had been completed, and two had been terminated early. Six studies with a total of 9,849 participants provided data for this review.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1119c3nK]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

To ascertain which parameters are important for determining variability in the impact projections across the 500 baseline model fits, a linear regression analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on the projected decrease in overall HCV incidence (2018–2030) of undertaking 6-monthly screening among HIV-diagnosed MSM and MSM using PrEP (no risk compensation). The proportion of the sum of squares contributed by each parameter was calculated to determine each parameter's importance to the variability in our projections.

We also performed a series of sensitivity analyses where we varied the following:

- **4 versus 6 months**: Between HCV diagnosis and treatment completion.
- **25% versus 12.5% coverage of PrEP**: The impact of different coverage levels.
- **Condom use among PrEP users**: Decreases to 13% instead of 34% with risk compensation.
- **Distribution of PrEP**:
	- Evenly between high and low-risk MSM
	- Just low-risk MSM
	- Just high-risk MSM
- **Infectiousness of HCV with HIV co-infection**: No increase.
- **Mixing by HIV-status following PrEP introduction**: 50% less mixing.
- **Risk associated with chem-sex**: No increased risk.
- **HCV transmission rate**:
	- Decreased by 20% from 2012 to simulate a decreasing HCV epidemic before the introduction of DAA treatments
	- Conversely, increased by 20% to simulate an increasing HCV epidemic.

Healthcare personnel are commonly exposed to infectious agents via sharp injuries (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus), direct patient care (e.g. pertussis and meningococcus), and the contaminated environment (e.g. Clostridium difficile). An effective occupational program is a key aspect of preventing the acquisition of infections by offering the following:

- **Education of healthcare personnel**: This includes proper handling of sharps, early identification and isolation of potentially infectious patients, and hand hygiene.
- **Assuring immunity**: Ensure immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases.
- **Immediate availability of medical evaluation**: A medical evaluation should be readily available following a nonprotected exposure to an infectious disease.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113Soie9]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

An estimated 1.1 million individuals in the United States are currently living with HIV, and more than 700,000 persons have died of AIDS since the first cases were reported in 1981. In 2017, there were 38,281 new diagnoses of HIV infection reported in the United States; 81% of these new diagnoses were among males and 19% were among females. Although treatable, HIV infection has no cure and has significant health consequences.

The objective is to issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection.

The evidence review conducted by the USPSTF examined the benefits of PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. It also assessed whether the benefits vary by risk group, population subgroup, or regimen or dosing strategy; the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at high risk of HIV acquisition; the rates of adherence to PrEP in primary care settings; the association between adherence and effectiveness of PrEP; and the harms of PrEP when used for HIV prevention.

The findings indicate that the USPSTF found convincing evidence that PrEP substantially decreases the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. Adherence to PrEP is highly associated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection; thus, adherence to PrEP is central to realizing its benefit.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: A clinical practice guideline [^114NFSLk]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

The CDC 2021 guidelines provide recommendations on preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, specifically focusing on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The guidelines recommend assessing HIV infection at least every 3 months in patients taking daily oral PrEP and every 4 months in patients receiving cabotegravir injections for PrEP, ensuring that individuals with an incident infection do not continue taking it. It is crucial to recognize that the 2-drug regimens of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, as well as the single drug cabotegravir, are inadequate therapies for established HIV infection. Their use in patients with early HIV infection may lead to resistance to one or more of the PrEP medications.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection (PROUD): Effectiveness results from the pilot phase of a pragmatic open-label randomised trial [^114AFfw7]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown that daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir-emtricitabine reduces the risk of HIV infection. However, this benefit could be counteracted by risk compensation in users of PrEP, which the PROUD study aimed to assess.

- **Methods**: PROUD is an open-label randomised trial conducted at 13 sexual health clinics in England. We enrolled HIV-negative gay and other men who have sex with men who had anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (245 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg) either immediately or following a deferral period of 1 year. Randomisation was executed via web-based access to a central computer-generated list with variable block sizes, stratified by clinical site. Follow-up was quarterly. The primary outcomes for the pilot phase were time to accrue 500 participants and retention; secondary outcomes included incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN94465371) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).

- **Findings**: We enrolled 544 participants (275 in the immediate group, 269 in the deferred group) between Nov 29, 2012, and April 30, 2014. Based on early evidence of effectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on Oct 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be offered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90%).

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^11155NvZ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

HCV incidence is based on the 490 participants who were considered HCV seronegative at enrolment or who had previously cleared HCV infection prior to enrolment and had at least one post-enrolment HCV test. Baseline characteristics of these participants indicate a cohort with high-risk behaviors: 226 (47.6%) reported use of chemsex-associated drugs in the past three months, 282 (57.6%) were diagnosed with any STI in the past 12 months, 170 (36.9%) reported using post-exposure prophylaxis in the past 12 months, and the median number of partners in the past three months was 10.

The median follow-up (enrolment to last HCV test) was 2.6 years (IQR: 2.1–3.0), with a total follow-up of 1188.8 person-years (PY). Overall, 25 participants had a new HCV infection, yielding an incidence rate of 2.1 per 100 PY (25/1188.8; 95% CI: 1.4–3.1). Three of these were re-infections (the previous infections had cleared spontaneously or with treatment before enrolment), and one participant experienced two infections during follow-up (only the first infection was included in the incidence calculation). Two HCV infections were acquired after diagnosis of HIV whilst the participant was no longer on PrEP but was being actively followed up. Excluding these cases from the HCV incidence calculation reduced the estimate only slightly to 1.9 per 100 PY (95% CI: 1.2–2.9). Use of nonprescribed injected drugs was reported by 11 participants at the suspected time.

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^117FPC8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Twenty-five years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 4 million people becoming infected every year. There is a need for HIV prevention strategies that are more effective. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the risk reduction and side effects of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE (1980 through June 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (March 2008); EMBASE (June 2008); and AIDSearch (June 2008). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in June 2008 for ongoing or prospective trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. The information gathered from each included trial were location of the trial, date, publication status, demographics of participants (e.g. age, gender, risk behavior), exposure modality, type of antiretroviral drug used, duration of drug use, and outcomes. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect. Only one trial met our inclusion criteria, so we did.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis: A useful tool to prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection [^113SmUN4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of preventive measures against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is to reduce the incidence of HIV infection in the general population and in high-risk groups, such as men having sex with men (MSM), and to reduce the risk that a given individual will contract or spread the virus. Male and female condoms, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision are preventive methods currently recognized or promoted worldwide. Although modest success has been reported in a phase-III vaccine trial, other methods are being evaluated, such as vaginal and rectal microbicides, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Herein, we discuss results from prevention trials, especially those focusing on PrEP and particularly on recent results from 'on-demand' PrEP regimens.

The efficacy of PrEP (rates of 0%-86%) is strongly correlated with adherence and plasma concentrations of antiretrovirals. Adverse events are rare. Selection of emtricitabine-resistant strains is mainly reported in individuals with an undiagnosed HIV infection using PrEP. PrEP is now strongly recommended in WHO prevention programmes for individuals at substantial risk for HIV, with a view to controlling this epidemic by 2030.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^115xK4S5]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

**Impact of increasing HCV screening in PrEP users**: In the previous section, no additional HCV screening of PrEP users occurred. Assuming 12.5% coverage of PrEP and no risk compensation (S0), screening PrEP users every 12, 6, or 3 months (and reducing time to completing treatment to 6 months) reduces the HCV incidence among PrEP users by 65.7% (95% CR 51.1–77.5%), 68.8% (95% CR 55.9–79.7%), or 70.4% (95% CR 58.4–80.7%), respectively, all compared to 2018 levels (Fig. 2), and the HCV incidence among all MSM decreases by 67.3% (95% CR 52.7–79.2%), 70.2% (95% CR 57.1–80.8%), or 71.8% (95% CR 59.5–81.6%). This sizeable impact is due to HCV transmission being primarily driven by high-risk MSM, which predominate among PrEP users, with the large impact of HCV treatment in PrEP users having a substantial subsequent impact among other high-risk MSM (especially HIV-positive MSM) due to them preferentially mixing with each other (, Supplementary materials). Risk compensation (S1) reduces the impact on HCV incidence in PrEP users of screening PrEP users by about half (Fig. 2).

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis accessibility research and evaluation (PrEPARE study) [^113qG53d]. AIDS and Behavior (2014). Low credibility.

Tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) has demonstrated effectiveness as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but it is not commonly prescribed. Our study was designed to determine the barriers preventing the utilization of PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM), the group at greatest risk for HIV infection in the United States. A population-based sample of MSM presenting for HIV testing at 'Early Test' HIV testing and counseling sites in San Diego, California, were offered PrEP and education about its potential efficacy. Eligible individuals reported having unprotected sex within the past 12 months and who tested negative for HIV were offered study participation. Despite offering procedures for evaluation and prescription for PrEP to 416 eligible subjects, less than 0.5% of participants received the drug.

Surveys collected from 54 of those who declined study participation revealed multiple barriers to PrEP among MSM, including cost, low perceived risk of infection, and concerns about taking a daily medication and potential long-term side effects. Efforts should be made to address these barriers, especially lowering the cost of TDF-FTC, providing education about PrEP side effects, and increasing awareness of HIV risks.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^113iR2MK]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

The PROUD study was an open-label, wait-list trial design that randomized men who have sex with men (MSM) attending participating sexual health centers in England to receive HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) immediately or following a deferral period of one year (the deferred phase). A total of 544 participants were recruited between November 2012 and April 2014, with follow-up continuing until October 2016. Following an interim analysis in November 2014 indicating PrEP's high effectiveness, the protocol was modified, allowing some participants in the deferred arm to be offered PrEP earlier than one year (N = 163).

The initial PROUD protocol followed national guidelines on hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing, which involved screening 'on indication'. Screening at enrollment was not mandated. The tests used during the trial varied by site, with the use of antibody, antigen, or viral load tests depending on the participant's prior HCV history. Information on HCV was collected in several ways. At enrollment, participants self-reported a diagnosis with HCV in the previous 12 months, and clinicians reported whether the participant had ever been screened for HCV and if diagnosed. At each visit, the number of HCV screens and positive screens (without distinguishing the type of test) since the previous visit was recorded. For all new infections, clinics were asked to provide detailed clinical and laboratory information, including dates of last positive and last negative tests (for all assays), HCV viral load test results, liver function test results, and history of injecting drug use.

### Preexposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116PTDu8]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

- **Importance**: An estimated 1.2 million persons in the US currently have HIV, and more than 760,000 persons have died of complications related to HIV since the first cases were reported in 1981. Although treatable, HIV is not curable and has significant health consequences. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent HIV are an important public health and clinical priority.

- **Objective**: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of preexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of HIV acquisition, and the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition.

- **Population**: Adolescents and adults who do not have HIV and are at increased risk of HIV.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that there is a substantial net benefit from the use of effective antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV in persons at increased risk of acquiring HIV.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe preexposure prophylaxis using effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV (A recommendation).

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis and the promise of combination prevention approaches [^114qUc8v]. AIDS and Behavior (2011). Low credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is a promising experimental approach currently being tested globally. Several PrEP trials are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PrEP in men who have sex with men (MSM) and other populations at risk for HIV, and results will be available from this first generation of efficacy trials over the next few years. Here, we review the rationale for orally-administered antiretrovirals for prevention and outline issues the first generation trials will address, as well as questions that may be addressed in future studies. We also describe the rationale for combination prevention approaches that may combine PrEP with other prevention modalities as part of a larger prevention package.

### Persistence with human immunodeficiency virus pre-exposure prophylaxis in the United States, 2012–2017 [^116nimnW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection if used adherently throughout periods of HIV risk. We estimated PrEP persistence among cohorts of persons with commercial or Medicaid insurance.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database to identify persons aged 18–64 years who initiated PrEP between 2012 and 2017. We assessed PrEP persistence by calculating the time period that each person continued filling PrEP prescriptions until there was a gap in prescription fills > 30 days. We used Kaplan-Meier time-to-event methods to estimate the proportion of PrEP users who persisted with PrEP at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation and constructed Cox proportional hazards models to determine patient characteristics associated with nonpersistence.

- **Results**: We studied 11,807 commercially insured and 647 Medicaid insured persons with PrEP prescriptions. Commercially insured patients persisted for a median time of 13.7 months (95% confidence interval, 13.3–14.1), compared to 6.8 months (95% CI, 6.1–7.6) among Medicaid patients. Additionally, female sex, younger age, residence in rural location, and black race were associated with shorter persistence. After adjusting for covariates, we found that female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81 [95% CI, 1.56–2.11]) and younger age (18–24 years: HR, 2.38 [95% CI, 2.11–2.69]) predicted nonpersistence.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1152YmPZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Routine HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV care appointments provide opportunities to screen men who have sex with men (MSM) for hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). However, the levels of screening required to achieve the WHO elimination target of reducing HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 among all MSM are unknown.

- **Methods**: An HCV/HIV transmission model was calibrated to the UK prevalence of HIV among MSM (4.7%) and chronic HCV infection among HIV-positive MSM (9.9%) and HIV-negative MSM (1.2%). Assuming 12.5% coverage of PrEP among HIV-negative MSM, we evaluated the relative reduction in overall HCV incidence by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels) with HCV screening every 12 or 6 months. This was done alongside completing direct-acting antiviral treatment within 6 months of diagnosis in PrEP users and/or HIV-diagnosed MSM. We estimated the additional screening required among HIV-negative non-PrEP users to reduce overall incidence by 90% by 2030. The effect of a 50% reduction in condom use among PrEP users (risk compensation) was also estimated.

- **Results**: Screening and treating PrEP users for HCV every 12 or 6 months decreases HCV incidence by 67.3% (uncertainty range 52.7–79.2%) or 70.2% (57.1–80.8%), respectively, increasing to 75.4% (59.0–88.6%) or 78.8% (63.9–90.4%) if HIV-diagnosed MSM are also screened at the same frequencies. Risk compensation reduces these projections by less than 10%. To reduce HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 without risk compensation, HIV-negative non-PrEP users require screening every 5.6 years (range 3.8–9.2 years) if MSM on PrEP and HIV-diagnosed MSM are screened every 6 months.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^117QvpDp]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Impact of PrEP on HIV**: A 12.5% coverage of PrEP among HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) translates to 27.6% of high-risk HIV-negative MSM and 10.3% of low-risk HIV-negative MSM receiving PrEP. From 2018 to 2030, this PrEP coverage results in 44.7% (95% confidence range 30.4–66.7%) of new HIV infections being prevented if sexual behaviors remain unchanged (scenario S0). This significant impact on HIV is due to PrEP being targeted to high-risk MSM, which results in the basic reproductive rate decreasing close to one. Less impact on HIV is achieved if PrEP is not targeted to high-risk MSM (see Fig. S5).

- **Table 2**: Model projections of the impact of PrEP on HCV prevalence, incidence, and the relative change in new HIV and HCV infections for 12.5% and 25.0% PrEP coverage with and without risk compensation. The risk compensation scenario assumes condom use among PrEP users reduces from 68% to 34%. PrEP users in the 'No PrEP' scenario are assumed to be representative of MSM who are eligible for PrEP in 2018.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: A clinical practice guideline [^115cDX9H]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus infection, particularly with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend providing access directly or by facilitated referral to the following when pre-exposure prophylaxis is prescribed:

- **Support for medication adherence and continuity**: Follow-up in pre-exposure prophylaxis care is essential, as high medication adherence and persistent use are critical to its effectiveness for the prevention of HIV acquisition.

- **Additional proven effective risk-reduction services**: These services should be tailored to the reported HIV exposure-prone behaviors. The aim is to enable the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis in combination with other effective prevention methods. This is crucial to reducing the risk of sexual acquisition of STIs or the acquisition of bloodborne bacterial and viral infections through injection drug use.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^117KKKnu]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

The cumulative incidence of HCV infection (time to diagnosis) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis; randomized groups were compared using the log-rank test, censoring at the time of the last screen for HCV. Estimation of incidence by calendar year was complicated by the highly variable time between the last negative test and the first positive test, which, in some cases, could span adjacent calendar years. To address this, the date of infection was imputed 1000 times, assuming a uniform distribution, and calculating the incidence for each calendar year within each imputed dataset. Estimates were obtained by averaging across the imputed datasets, and confidence intervals were derived using Rubin's rule. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 15.1.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1176Rrbe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **PrEP intervention scenarios**: The calibrated model was used to estimate the impact of initiating a PrEP program, with the coverage of PrEP scaling up to 12.5% of HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) over the period 2018–2020, while assuming the average duration on PrEP was 8.2 months. This coverage assumption was based on NHS-eligibility criteria, where only MSM recently participating in unprotected sex are eligible for PrEP. The relative coverage of PrEP among low- and high-risk MSM reflects these eligibility criteria (see Supplementary materials). The efficacy of PrEP for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition was assumed to be 91.5% (86–97%).

PrEP-driven risk compensation was also modeled. However, because of inconclusive data on how sexual behaviors may change, we only considered reductions in condom use among MSM using PrEP. In our modeling, we either assume no risk compensation (Scenario S0) or that all PrEP users halve their consistency of condom use from 68% to 34% with all partners (Scenario S1). This assumption is varied in our sensitivity analyses.

### Descovy [^116iXobp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning: Post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B and risk of drug resistance with use of Descovy for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in undiagnosed early HIV-1 infection**: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (HBV) have been reported in HBV-infected individuals who have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and may occur with discontinuation of Descovy.

Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals who are infected with HBV and discontinue Descovy. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Descovy used for HIV-1 PrEP must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of FTC/TDF for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Warning: Post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B and risk of drug resistance with use of Descovy for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in undiagnosed early HIV-1 infection**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.
