## Question

A 55-year-old with weight loss, new-onset diabetes, and necrolytic migratory erythema has elevated fasting glucagon levels. MRI shows a 2 cm pancreatic tail lesion, and pathology confirms a benign alpha-cell neuroendocrine tumor. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing the glucagonoma diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM diagnosis code should be used for a benign glucagonoma of the pancreatic tail. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the tumor's behavior and whether it is benign or malignant. Then, I should verify the anatomic site within the pancreas. Next, I will check whether a specific histologic subtype code exists for glucagonoma. Finally, I will confirm the most specific ICD-10-CM code and consider any alternatives if the exact subtype is not available in the coding system.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its typical behavior. Glucagonoma is a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor arising from alpha cells that classically presents with necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes, and weight loss; most are malignant at diagnosis, but a subset are benign, and the tail is the most common location, which fits this 2 cm pancreatic tail lesion with benign pathology [^111G3RN4] [^1133dNGB] [^116cHD52].

> Wait, let me verify the coding framework. In ICD-10-CM, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are categorized by behavior and site; benign neoplasms of the endocrine pancreas are coded to D13.7, whereas malignant neoplasms of the endocrine pancreas are coded to C25.4, so the benign behavior here directs me toward D13.7 rather than C25.4 [^1123Nyop] [^114V2efw].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is a more specific histologic subtype code for glucagonoma. I initially thought there might be a dedicated ICD-10-CM code like D13.71 for glucagonoma, but wait, I need to check the available options; there is no subcategory under D13.7 for specific hormone-secreting subtypes in ICD-10-CM, so the most specific code remains D13.7 for benign neoplasm of the endocrine pancreas, with glucagonoma captured by the documentation rather than a distinct billable code [^notfound].

> I should confirm the anatomic specificity. The lesion is in the pancreatic tail, but ICD-10-CM D13.7 does not break down by pancreatic region, so I cannot add tail-specific granularity; I will document the tail location in the clinical note and use D13.7 as the diagnosis code, which is consistent with how benign endocrine pancreatic neoplasms are coded in practice.

> Let me consider alternatives and ensure I'm not missing a better code. Using a generic pancreatic neoplasm code would be less specific, and using a malignant code would be incorrect given the benign pathology; therefore, D13.7 remains the most accurate ICD-10-CM choice for a benign glucagonoma of the pancreas [^1123Nyop].

> Final answer: The appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code is D13.7 Benign neoplasm of endocrine pancreas, with glucagonoma documented in the record to support clinical specificity even though the code itself does not name the hormone subtype [^1123Nyop].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a benign glucagonoma is **D13.7** (benign neoplasm of endocrine pancreas). This code applies regardless of tumor size or location within the pancreas, as ICD-10-CM does not provide a more specific code for benign glucagonoma. If the tumor were malignant, the code would be **C25.4** (malignant neoplasm of endocrine pancreas). Accurate coding supports appropriate management and billing for this rare functional neuroendocrine tumor [^1123Nyop].

## ICD-10-CM coding for glucagonoma

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, including glucagonomas, based on their **malignant or benign nature**. The relevant codes are:

| **ICD-10-CM code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| C25.4 | Malignant neoplasm of endocrine pancreas |
| D13.7 | Benign neoplasm of endocrine pancreas |

---

Given that the pathology report confirms a **benign alpha-cell neuroendocrine tumor**, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code is **D13.7**.

---

## Clinical features supporting the diagnosis

The clinical presentation of the patient — weight loss, new-onset diabetes, and necrolytic migratory erythema — is classic for **glucagonoma syndrome**, which results from excessive glucagon secretion by an alpha-cell tumor [^111G3RN4]. Elevated fasting glucagon levels and imaging showing a pancreatic tail lesion further support the diagnosis [^116Q8JEm].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

- **Specificity**: ICD-10-CM does not provide a more specific code for benign glucagonoma beyond D13.7. Therefore, D13.7 is the most accurate code available for this diagnosis.
- **Documentation**: It is essential to document the benign nature of the tumor clearly in the medical record to support the use of D13.7 rather than C25.4.
- **Billing implications**: Accurate coding ensures appropriate reimbursement and facilitates tracking of rare diseases for epidemiological purposes.

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a benign glucagonoma is **D13.7**. This code accurately reflects the benign nature of the tumor and aligns with the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.

Tumour classification

NENs were defined by the WHO 2015 classification excluding diffuse pulmonary neuroendocrine hyperplasia. Tumours occurring at all anatomical sites between C00 and C80 according to the 10th edition of the WHO International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes were included, and morphology codes included 8013 (excluding lung [C34 and C78]), 8041–8045 (excluding lung), 8150–8158, 8240–8247, 8249 and 9091 according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3). All were behaviour code 3 (malignant), 6 (metastatic) or 9 (malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic).

Tumours were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging for NENsand the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) recommendations for the staging of GEP-NENsand graded using the ENETS grading system (WHO 2010) for GEP-NENs, – or according to pathological grading of differentiation for other sites. Ki-67 status was not uniformly captured and is not recognised yet in many organ systems. Due to this being a registry study, we were unable to revisit each tissue specimen to acquire it, most grades were therefore based on a morphology of "poorly differentiated" or "well-differentiated" so grade 1 and grade 2 were combined to reduce inaccuracies. Tumour grades were classified: grade 1 and grade 2 combined — NET G1/G2 (functioning tumours including insulinomas, glucagonomas etc. with morphology codes 8150–8153, 8155–8158 and tumours with morphology codes 8240–8242, 8249, and 9091); grade 3 — NEC G3 (large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, combined small cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma NOS with morphology codes 8013, 8041–8045, and 8246); Mixed Adeno-Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (MANEC) (Now known as 'goblet cell adenocarcinomas') goblet cell carcinoid, mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoid tumour with morphology codes 8243–8245); and "other" (pancreatic endocrine tumour malignant, mixed pancreatic endocrine and exocrine tumour malignant, and Merkel cell carcinoma morphology codes 8150, 8154 and 8247, respectively).

Glucagonoma syndrome — presentation and tumor location: Glucagonoma syndrome (hyperglucagonemia) arises from glucagon hypersecretion by NETs in the alpha cells of the islets in the pancreas, with most cases (87%) occurring in the tail or body of the pancreas. Patients with glucagonoma may develop necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) and other symptoms such as diabetes mellitus, depression, diarrhea, and deep vein thrombosis, and awareness of the condition is important to facilitate prompt treatment.

MEN1 glucagonoma — presentation and treatment: Glucagonomas occur in fewer than 3% of patients with MEN1, and characteristic manifestations of a skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema), weight loss, anemia, and stomatitis may be absent, with tumors detected by pancreatic imaging or by glucose intolerance and hyperglucagonemia. The tail of the pancreas is the most frequent site and surgical removal is the treatment of choice, but treatment may be difficult because approximately 50 to 80% of patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis. Medical treatment with somatostatin analogs (octreotide or lanreotide), or chemotherapy with streptozotocin and 5-fluorouracil or dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole carboxamide has been successful in some patients, and hepatic artery embolization has been used to treat metastatic disease.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Validation of ICD-9-CM coding algorithm for improved identification of hypoglycemia visits [^1117QPHS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoglycemia is an important complication in patients with diabetes that has a profound impact on quality of life and self-management. While tight glycemic control remains a hallmark to lower rates of complications, the barrier of hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in the maintenance of euglycemia. Mild or self-treated episodes of hypoglycemia are common, especially in type 1 diabetes, with reported rates of two episodes per week. Severe hypoglycemia, or episodes requiring external assistance, may occur at least once a year, and are a significant cause of morbidity.

Although some episodes of severe hypoglycemia are treated at home by administration of oral glucose or intramuscular glucagon by family members, the most severe episodes require ambulance or emergency department (ED) visits. Although ED visits for severe hypoglycemia represent a small percentage of the total episodes of hypoglycemia in diabetes, they do serve as a good epidemiological marker of the complication and result in significant economical and psychological costs.

Most data on the epidemiology of hypoglycemia are based on highly selected patients in the setting of large clinical trials, and may not generalize to the general population. Accurate identification of hypoglycemia cases by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes may help to describe the epidemiology, monitor trends, and propose interventions to improve diabetes care through national administrative databases and local chart reviews. There are several ICD-9-CM coding options for hypoglycemia, some of which may represent other diagnoses. For example, diabetes with other specified manifestations (250.8) may represent hypoglycemia or diabetic lower extremity ulcers. While several prior studies have utilized ICD-9-CM codes to identify cases of hypoglycemia, only Johnson et al. described the accuracy of ICD-9-CM codes to identify hypoglycemia episodes, but with significant methodological limitations.

Building on this prior work, we evaluated the accuracy a new ICD-9-CM coding algorithm to identify cases of hypoglycemia presenting to the ED. We hypothesized that our proposed algorithm would identify hypoglycemia with a positive predictive value (PPV) of at least 80%.

### Effect of metastatic site on survival in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). An analysis of SEER data from 2010 to 2014 [^111cANYt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

We queried the SEER database on the November 2017 submission. We specified the time frame from 2010 to 2014. We identified NENs by ICD-O3 histology codes based on prior relevant publications and the following diagnoses: Carcinoid tumor (8240), enterochromaffin cell carcinoid (8241), neuroendocrine carcinoma (8246), atypical carcinoid tumor (8249), malignant enterochromaffin-like cell tumor (8242), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (8013), mixed pancreatic malignant endocrine and exocrine tumor (8154), insulinoma (8151), glucagonoma (8152), malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor (8150), gastrinoma (8153), somatostatinoma (8156), vipoma (8155). We excluded any diagnosis code related to small cell lung cancer, mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma and goblet cell carcinoid. We extracted the following variables: Age; sex; marital status; histology; grading; origin; site of metastasis and survival. As this is publicly available, de-identified data, no institutional review board (IRB) approval was required.

NEN classification

We relied on SEER histologic grade information to classify cases as Grade 1 /G1 or well differentiated; G2 or moderately differentiated; G3 or poorly differentiated; and G4 or undifferentiated / anaplastic. Grade 3 and 4 tumors have similar survival characteristics as per prior publications, are being treated with the same regimens and thus we grouped them together in the high grade category. For our analyses we only included patients with a single general site of metastasis (liver, lung, bone or brain) and where the grade was documented. We codified tumors of origin into the following 4 groups: Small bowel, lung, pancreatic and other/miscellaneous. Lung NENs are generally classified into typical and atypical carcinoids, large cell and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but for this analysis we relied on histology and grade documentation and the small cell subgroup was excluded.

Glucagonomas — surgical management is tailored to tumor location and thrombotic risk. Most glucagonomas are malignant and calcified and located in the tail of the pancreas, with regional node involvement, and the recommended treatment is distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and resection of the peripancreatic lymph nodes. For tumors in the pancreatic head, pancreatoduodenectomy with resection of the peripancreatic lymph nodes is recommended. Small (< 2 cm) peripheral glucagonomas are rare; enucleation or local excision with peripancreatic lymph dissection may be considered for small peripheral tumors of the head or distal pancreas. A hypercoagulable state has been reported in 10% to 33% of patients with glucagonoma; therefore, perioperative anticoagulation can be considered because of the increased risk of pulmonary emboli.

### The incidence of insulinoma in Western Sweden between 2002 and 2019 [^1123Nyop]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This was a retrospective study conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. All patients in the VGR with suspected insulinoma are referred to the Sahlgrenska University Hospital for further evaluation, workup and treatment. At the beginning of the study period (January 1 st 2002), according to the Swedish National database of statistics, the VGR had a population of 1,507,614 individuals. At the end of the study period (December 31 st 2019), the population was 1,724,529 individuals (mean 1,595,917).

The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of West Sweden, Gothenburg, Sweden (DNR 814–18).

Identification of patients and data collection

Any diagnosis recorded at a patient visit to any Swedish hospital is coded in a diagnosis-related group (DRG) registry. To identify patients with insulinoma, the DRG registry at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital was searched for the following ICD-10 codes (recorded between January 1 st 2002 and December 31 st 2019): D13.7 (benign neoplasm in the endocrine part of the pancreas), C25.4 (malignant neoplasm in the endocrine part of the pancreas) and E16.1 (other hypoglycemia), and/or the following workup code: AB011 (fasting test). Medical records of all identified patients were reviewed and information was collected on clinical, biochemical, radiological and histopathological findings, as well as management and outcome. In addition, the duration of symptoms before diagnosis was estimated through chart review, based on the patient's own description of symptoms consistent with an insulin-producing Pan-NEN.

### New-onset diabetes: an early sign of pancreatic cancer?-NCI… [^116tK1is]. NCI (2021). Medium credibility.

With his diabetes diagnosis confirmed, Bob got back to his normal routine, with the addition of daily blood sugar checks. But only a year after that trip to the eye doctor, he received a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He died 9 months later. Around the time of Bob's cancer diagnosis, in 2005, Tom overheard some of his doctors mention a growing suspicion of a possible link between a new diagnosis of diabetes, sometimes called new-onset diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. In other words, in rare cases, diabetes may actually be caused by a tumor in the pancreas. Over the last several years, evidence has mounted to support a link between new-onset diabetes and pancreatic cancer. And the Aronson family's hope has been inching closer to reality: Several large NCI-supported studies are testing ways to pick out those people whose diabetes might be a sign of a much deadlier problem.

The research is part of larger ongoing efforts aimed at finding ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, when treatments may be more effective. And living with diabetes for a long time "is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer, " said V. Wendy Setiawan, Ph. D., of the University of Southern California, who's led long-term studies of pancreatic cancer risk in diverse populations. The reasons why aren't totally clear, but some of the proposed mechanisms include higher-than-normal levels of insulin circulating in the blood, high blood sugar, and long-term inflammation caused by type 2 diabetes, she explained. This type of diabetes is very uncommon, explained Anirban Maitra, M. B. B. S., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. "In the overwhelming majority — more than 99% — of new cases of diabetes, it's just run-of-the-mill type 2 diabetes, " Dr. Maitra explained. But the other 1% with pancreatogenic diabetes have a risk that their diabetes is driven by pancreatic cancer.

Finding Those at Highest Risk At the moment, there's no good answer to that question. Sending every person with new-onset diabetes to get imaging tests of the pancreas would result in too many unnecessary follow-up surgical procedures — when abnormalities seen on scans turn out not to be cancer — potentially doing more harm than good, explained Suresh Chari, M. D., also of MD Anderson. To help find these rare patients with pancreatogenic diabetes while limiting harms, including unnecessary surgeries and the fear caused by undergoing diagnostic procedures, Drs. Chari and Maitra are leading a nationwide project, funded by NCI and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, called the New Onset Diabetes Study.

The project, which is in the process of enrolling 10, 000 people with new-onset diabetes or hyperglycemia, hopes to develop a blood test that can identify the few individuals who may need further testing for pancreatic cancer, Dr. Maitra explained. "Can we identify biomarkers in the blood that will tell us, in a room of 100 patients with new-onset diabetes, there may be someone who we need to send for more workup and imaging studies. " he asked. Out of 10, 000 participants, Drs. Chari and Maitra estimate that about 85 will develop pancreatic cancer during the study. Participants will donate blood samples periodically for up to 3 years. The NOD researchers will look for proteins and other biomarkers found in samples that differ substantially between people who later develop pancreatic cancer and those who don't.

### Glucagonoma and glucagonoma syndrome: an updated review [^111G3RN4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Glucagonoma is a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (pNET) originating from the alpha cells of the pancreas, with a global incidence of approximately one in 20 million people per year. Most glucagonomas occur sporadically, although a small percentage, around 3%, can be inherited and can be associated with other tumours in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1. Glucagonoma can cause a range of symptoms known as 'glucagonoma syndrome', including necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes mellitus (DM), weight loss, normochromic normocytic anaemia, diarrhoea/steatorrhea, venous thrombosis and neuropsychiatric disturbances.

In 1998, Soga and Yakuwa evaluated 407 reported cases of glucagonoma and in 2018 Song reported 216 cases of glucagonoma published between 1999 and 2016, highlighting the major characteristics of the syndrome.

The aim of the present review was to evaluate cases of glucagonoma documented in and after 2017 and make a comparison with the previous published series, to show the trend of the disease during the last decades.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) hormonal syndromes and subtype distribution: In the NCCN NETs Outcomes Database, 22% of patients with PanNETs have a hormonal syndrome; among functioning tumors, ≤ 70% are insulinomas and only 10% are associated with metastases. Approximately 15% are glucagonomas, whereas gastrinomas and somatostatinomas account for another 10%, and gastrinomas and somatostatinomas (80%–90%) are associated with a relatively high risk for metastases. Remaining rare PanNETs include VIPoma and cholecystokinin-producing tumors.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113budwy]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, evidence suggests that surgical management is the better choice for managing patients with PNETs. The European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) recommends surgery for advanced PNETs, as discussed at a consensus meeting. In addition, the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS), the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS), and the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) all recommend surgical resection for functional tumors and nonfunctional tumors > 2 cm, with observation reserved for select small, asymptomatic cases. The agreement between our data-driven findings and expert consensus highlights the importance of evidence-based expert opinion in guiding clinical decision-making. This is particularly valuable in complex cases such as PNETs, where empirical evidence alone may not fully capture the complexity of patient management.

Our study had certain limitations. First, there was heterogeneity in our results. To address this, we used the GRADE tool and acknowledged that the retrieved results presented a low level of evidence. Second, all included studies were observational and retrospective in nature. To improve the quality of evidence, randomized clinical trials or matched case-control studies are needed to compare the efficacy of surgical and nonsurgical management. Furthermore, current evidence does not consistently report the functional status of tumors (e.g. insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma), and most studies did not stratify outcomes by specific functional subtypes. It is also important to note that functional PNETs are typically treated surgically, even at small sizes, which likely leads to underrepresentation of these tumors in the nonsurgical comparator group. As a result, survival outcomes for nonsurgically managed functional PNETs may be underestimated. Nevertheless, we performed a subgroup analysis only in functional PNETs, and included and analyzed them accordingly in our quantitative synthesis. This limitation highlights the need for more granular, function-specific comparative data in future research. Another limitation is that several included studies enrolled patients diagnosed prior to the widespread adoption of modern World Health Organization (WHO) grading and classification systems. Since most studies did not stratify outcomes by diagnostic era or histologic criteria, older cases with potentially inconsistent diagnostic standards may have been included. However, many of these studies were excluded through sensitivity analyses based on sample size and follow-up duration, minimizing the impact of historical heterogeneity. Future studies should stratify outcomes by diagnostic standards to improve comparability. The final limitation is that for many key outcomes, including molecular subtypes, hereditary syndromes, optimal surgical/nonsurgical managements, tumor location, and cause-specific mortality, subgroup stratification was not performed in the majority of included studies, making formal meta-analysis infeasible. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative synthesis of studies that did report these subgroup data in order to provide a narrative evaluation of these important clinical variables. These limitations highlight the need for future studies to systematically stratify and report such subgroups to enable more granular and informative comparative analyses.

Preoperative management — pancreatic endocrine tumors: Surgical resection is described as optimal, but symptoms of hormonal excess should be treated first, with octreotide LAR or lanreotide used for symptom control in most PanNET subtypes and considered in insulinoma only if the tumor expresses SSTRs; these agents can worsen hypoglycemia and should not be used when SSTR-based imaging is negative. Additional symptom-directed measures include stabilizing glucose for insulinomas, treating gastrin hypersecretion with high-dose PPIs, managing hyperglycemia and diabetes in glucagonoma prior to surgery, and providing preoperative vaccinations for patients who might require splenectomy.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

Functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) — acute symptom control principles: There are five main types of functioning panNETs, including insulinoma, gastrinoma, somatostatinoma, glucagonoma, and VIPoma, and the priority for functioning panNETs is to control the hormone excess state as soon as possible, even before diagnosis and staging. The evidence base for functioning panNETs comprises lower-quality data with case reports, case series, and retrospective studies, and reduction of tumor bulk is an important intervention that can reduce the symptoms of hormonal syndromes.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1148k1ZY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative management of locoregional pancreatic endocrine tumors — Surgical resection is the optimal treatment for locoregional pancreatic endocrine tumors, but before excision any symptoms of hormonal excess must be treated; octreotide LAR or lanreotide can be used for symptom control in most PanNET subtypes, and can be considered for patients with insulinoma only if the tumor expresses SSTRs because they can suppress counterregulatory hormones; in this situation, octreotide LAR and lanreotide can precipitously worsen hypoglycemia and can result in fatal complications, and should not be used in patients with insulinoma who have a negative result by SSTR-based imaging. In addition, for insulinomas it is important to stabilize glucose levels with diet and/or diazoxide and/or everolimus; for gastrinomas, gastric hypersecretion may be treated with high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); for glucagonoma, treatment of hyperglycemia and diabetes is necessary, especially prior to surgery; all patients who might require splenectomy should receive preoperative vaccination against pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae type b, and meningococcal group c, with appropriate boosters within the recommended time frame.

4.3 Tumour Site and Size

Table 4 presents information regarding tumour location. In series A, a total of 85 (98.8%) cases reported the tumour to be located within the pancreas; this prevalence was higher compared to series B and series C (72.7% and 84.0%, respectively; p < 0.0001).

Table 4
Primary tumour sites.

Concerning pancreas, the vast majority in series A involved the tail (38.8%); the tail of the pancreas was the primary lesion site also in 36.3% of patients in series B and in 41.8% in series C; a diffused pattern of distribution of the lesions within pancreas was found in 5.9% of series A, 0% in series B (p = 0.0017) and 4.7% in series C; on the other hand, in series A, the exact site in the pancreas was unspecified in a lower percentage of cases (7.1% vs. 25.5% in series B; p = 0.0002).

As a whole, the vast majority had glucagonomas in the pancreas; six had extra pancreatic lesions and in nine cases primary tumour site was unknown.

Tumour size was recorded in 83.7% (72/86) cases reported in series A. Average diameter was 4.6 cm, similarly to the average diameter of 5.0 cm reported by Song in series B; the median tumour size in patients evaluated in series C was 3.1–5.5 cm.

### Glucagonoma and glucagonoma syndrome: an updated review [^114LaiRg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

Glucagonoma is a rare NET, secreting glucagon, which originates from the alpha cells of the pancreas.

A functioning NET syndrome is defined by the presence of a clinical syndrome combined with biochemical evidence of inappropriately elevated hormonal level; some NET may secrete biologically inactive hormonal variants or bioactive hormones at insufficient levels to elicit symptoms, and these should consequently be classified as nonfunctioning. Most glucagonomas are sporadic, rarely they can be inherited: around 3% of inherited glucagonomas can be associated with other tumours in the context of MEN1. In the current review, MEN1 was recorded in 13 cases (15.1%) in and after 2017. This finding is only reported in series C by Soga et al. consistent with a similar rate of MEN1 glucagonoma (13%). Furthermore, we observed an early average age at diagnosis in series A than previous ones underlining an improvement of disease knowledge and diagnostic procedures.

The major diagnostic criteria of glucagonoma syndrome are: (1) Imaging study confirming presence of pancreatic tumour; (2) elevated glucagon levels (> 1000 pg/dL); (3) NME; (4) personal history of MEN1. Most of these are nonspecific, except for the NME, which is pathognomonic for glucagonoma; but skin lesions are often mistakenly treated as dermatitis before arriving at the correct diagnosis of NME. This explains the delay in diagnosis with a median of 39 months after the development of NME.

NME is a distinctive, intensely erythematous skin rash that may appear before other systemic symptoms. Individual lesions are pruritic and painful, initially appearing as erythematous vesicles and bullae that evolve into patches or plaques with irregular borders, crusting, ulcerations and scaling. Hyperglucagonemia is central in the pathogenesis of NME, inducing a catabolic state that depletes zinc, amino acids, and essential fatty acids; consequently, NME can be classified as a deficiency dermatosis and it can improve up to 50% with somatostatin analogues, amino acid infusion, essential fatty acids, topic or oral zinc therapies, vitamins, minerals and antibiotics. Interestingly, the rate of NME was significantly higher in the last decade, probably due to the growing knowledge about this rare feature and thus due to the early recognition of the disease related to it.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using eight databases in six European countries (GE, the UK, FR, NE, BE, and SE). This study involved a retrospective cohort analysis using eight databases, and the analysis does not contain studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Research ethics approval was received from the regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm in order to conduct the Swedish analysis. Ethics approval was not required in the other countries.

Data Sources

Electronic Medical Records

The IMS LifeLink™ (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA): Electronic Medical Records databases (henceforth referred to as EMR) were used in GE, the UK, and FR. EMR contains longitudinal anonymized patient-level data from the EMRs of office-based physician practices [general practitioners (GPs) in the UK/FR, GPs/diabetologists in GE]. Data include basic demographics, physician-recorded medical diagnoses [International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) ICD-10 format] and written prescriptions [EphMRA Anatomical Classification (ATC) code]. EMR covers approximately 18.9%, 6.7%, and 7.6% of the GE, UK, and FR populations, respectively.

Retail Pharmacy

The IMS LifeLink™: Longitudinal Prescriptions databases (henceforth referred to as LRx) were used in the NE, BE, the UK (GPs only; limited to aggregated data analysis due to privacy legislation), and GE. LRx contains prescription data (EphMRA ATC code) and limited demographic data [e.g. age (unavailable in BE; age bands only in the UK), gender]. The representativeness of the databases based upon current population and pharmacy coverage in 2013 is: 72% NE, 32% BE, 51% GE, and 44% UK.

Both EMR and LRx databases were utilized in GE and UK as they provide somewhat different samples: physician-recorded pharmacy and clinical data vs. filled pharmacy prescription data. Overlap in the populations from the two databases is possible.

Sweden

The Swedish national drug register was utilized, which provides national, patient-level data on all prescription drugs dispensed at all pharmacies from the Swedish National Pharmacy Corporation (World Health Organization [WHO] ATC code). In addition, the Swedish Mortality Register was used to identify patient death and provide full visibility into patient follow-up. Research ethics approval was received from the regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm.

### Putting the pieces together: necrolytic migratory erythema and the glucagonoma syndrome [^111QUTJu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Glucagonomas are slow-growing, rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. They may present with paraneoplastic phenomena known together as the "glucagonoma syndrome". A hallmark sign of this syndrome is a rash known as necrolytic migratory erythema (NME). In this paper, the authors describe a patient with NME and other features of the glucagonoma syndrome. The diagnosis of this rare tumor requires an elevated serum glucagon level and imaging confirming a pancreatic tumor. Surgical and medical treatment options are reviewed. When detected early, a glucagonoma is surgically curable. It is therefore imperative that clinicians recognize the glucagonoma syndrome in order to make an accurate diagnosis and refer for treatment.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell… [^111XmCp8]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points
- Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormone-making cells of the pancreas.
- Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms.
- There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.
- Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs.
- Different types of pancreatic NETs have different signs and symptoms.
- Lab tests and imaging tests are used to diagnose pancreatic NETs.
- Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs.
- Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas: Endocrine pancreas cellsmake several kinds of hormones, such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans.

This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be benign or malignant. When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma. Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis. Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms. Pancreatic NETs may be functional or nonfunctional:

- Functional tumors make extra amounts of hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon, that cause signs and symptoms.
- Nonfunctional tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. Signs and symptoms are caused by the tumor as it spreads and grows. Most nonfunctional tumors are malignant. Most pancreatic NETs are functional tumors. There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.

Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs include the following: A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant. Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign. Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the liver to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia. A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas.

Most glucagonomas are malignant. Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include:

- VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.
- Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin. Signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET The signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET depend on the type of hormone being made. Too much gastrin may cause:

- Stomach ulcers that keep coming back.
- Pain in the abdomen, which may spread to the back. The pain may come and go and it may go away after taking an antacid.
- The flow of stomach contents back into the esophagus.
- Diarrhea. Too much insulin may cause:

- Low blood sugar.

Glucagonoma symptom control and antitumor therapy — surgery is not always possible for 50% to 90% of well-differentiated glucagonomas that have already metastasized at the time of diagnosis; stabilization of glucagon levels with somatostatin analogs (SSAs) can result in prompt improvement in NME, and everolimus can increase patients' glucose levels so caution should be used and glucose levels should be monitored if considered for tumor control; in a study of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 34 patients with metastatic functioning G1–G2 panNETs, five of the seven patients with uncontrolled symptoms of glucagonoma experienced a symptomatic response and none of these patients experienced a hormonal crisis.

### Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors) treatment… [^1146TZLk]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Most pancreatic NETs are sporadic, but some occur as part of the autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 inherited syndrome. This syndrome consists of tumors of the anterior pituitary, parathyroid, and endocrine pancreas glands and is a result of inactivation of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 11q13. When part of the MEN1 syndrome, there may be multiple pancreatic tumors. Tumor localization and staging studies include imaging with computed tomography with or without magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasonography. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy and single-photon emission CT may be useful adjuncts. However, somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy is less useful in localizing insulinomas versus other pancreatic NETs, since insulinomas often have a low density of somatostatin receptors. The clinical manifestations are those of hypoglycemia, which results from inappropriate secretion of insulin by the tumor.

Fasting hypoglycemia associated with an elevated insulin level is pathognomonic. Measurement of plasma proinsulin may be helpful for diagnosing insulin-secreting carcinomas. These tumors are usually slow-growing tumors and, when localized to the pancreas or regional lymph nodes, can be cured with pancreatic resection. The approach to management depends on carefully performed preoperative localization studies and the findings at exploratory laparotomy. In a retrospective case series of 30 patients with 32 pancreatic insulinomas, the combination of preoperative, dual-phase, thin-section multidetector CT and endoscopic sonography correctly identified and localized all of the tumors.

These tests, with or without MRI, have replaced older, more invasive, and technically challenging tests, such as percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling and arterial stimulation with venous sampling, except for unusual circumstances in which the imaging tests are unsuccessful. Glucagonoma Glucagonoma is the third most common endocrine-secreting islet cell tumor. About 75% of glucagonomas are malignant. Necrolytic migratory erythema, hyperglycemia, and venous thrombosis comprise a virtually diagnostic triad. A serum glucagon level greater than 1, 000 pg/mL confirms the diagnosis. These tumors tend to be large and easily visible on CT scan. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy scanning may be a useful adjunct in detecting metastases. VIPoma is characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. A serum vasoactive intestinal peptide greater than 200 pg/mL is diagnostic. These tumors can generally be easily localized by CT scan.

### The incidence of insulinoma in Western Sweden between 2002 and 2019 [^114V2efw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulinoma is a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm with an incidence of 0.7–4 cases per million/year. Because of its rarity, epidemiological studies on insulinoma are few and limited by small sample sizes. An increasing incidence of insulinoma has recently been suggested. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of insulinoma in the Västra Götaland Region (VGR) of Sweden. Secondary aims were to evaluate clinical characteristics, diagnostic workup, management and outcome in patients diagnosed with insulinoma.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed for all patients in the VGR who had received an ICD-10 diagnosis code of a benign (D13.7) and/or a malignant (C25.4) tumor in the endocrine part of the pancreas, of hypoglycemia (E.161), and/or a code of a fasting test (AB011), from 2002–2019.

Results

Forty-two patients with insulinoma were identified, 37 of whom (20 men) were residents in the VGR at the time of diagnosis, giving a mean annual incidence of 1.3 cases per million/year. The mean (± standard deviation) age at diagnosis was 56 ± 18 years. Six of the 37 (16%) patients had metastatic insulinoma and 2 patients (5%) had a confirmed multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. At preoperative workup, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound detected an insulinoma in 28/36 (78%) and 21/21 (100%) cases, respectively.

Conclusions

Insulinoma remains a rare tumor in the modern era. The recorded mean annual incidence of 1.3 cases per million/year is compatible with the reported incidence in Sweden during the 1980s. Our results do not support an increasing incidence of insulinoma.

### Glucagonoma and glucagonoma syndrome: an updated review [^1114BZox]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagonoma is a rare well-differentiated slowly proliferating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, characterized by several manifestations including necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, diabetes and anaemia.

Aim

The purpose of the current review was to acknowledge literature about this rare tumour discerning the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glucagonoma by comparing three different periods.

Results

A study published by Song reviewed 216 cases from studies published between 1999 and 2016, making a comparison with 407 cases reported before 1998 by Soga and Yakuwa. The current review consisted of 86 cases reported in studies published in and after 2017: 40 males and 46 females, with an average age of 48.2 years. The male-to-female ratio was 0.87. The rate of typical clinical findings was as follows: NME, 93.2% (69/74); DM, 70.3% (50/74); weight loss, 62.2% (46/74); anaemia, 44.6% (33/74); glossitis or stomatitis or cheilitis, 31.1% (23/74). A total of 85 cases reported the location of the tumour as the pancreas and 38.8% of these cases involved the tail of the pancreas. The average tumour size was 4.6cm in patients between 2017 and 2024. Metastasis was detected in 52.3% of patients (45/86). The comparison with previous series highlighted an earlier age of diagnosis of glucagonoma and a higher rate of NME, consistent with a higher diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

Glucagonoma is a rare pathology, with peculiar characteristics that need to be acknowledged to achieve a timely diagnosis and finally improve patient prognosis.

4.2 Clinical Manifestation

Regarding the clinical manifestations of glucagonoma, data were available in 74 patients of the 86 cases documented in series A, in 192 of series B and in 233 in series C.

The rate of frequency of NME was higher in series A compared to series B (93.2% vs. 79.2%; p = 0.0057). No significant difference in the other clinical manifestations were observed comparing series A with other groups (Table 3). In the current series, there was a small number of patients, 8, who were not diagnosed with DM but had prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a fasting glucose of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), and IGT, a 2‐h glucose level of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If the DM and prediabetes were considered together, the rate was significantly higher in series A than in series B (81% vs. 62.5%; p = 0.005).

Results

The incidence of insulinoma

In total, 583 patients were identified as being assigned at least one of the above specified codes (D13.7, C25.4, E16.1, and/or AB011) (Fig. 1). Among these 583 patients, 42 were indeed diagnosed with insulinoma. Five of these 42 patients were excluded from further analysis (4 residing outside the VGR and 1 diagnosed before the study started). Thus, 37 inhabitants of the VGR, 20 (54%) men and 17 (46%) women, were diagnosed with an insulinoma between 2002 and 2019, giving a mean annual incidence of 1.3 cases per million/year. Twenty-one (57%) patients were diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 and 16 (43%) between 2011 and 2019.

Summary of the final diagnoses in 583 patients who had been assigned at least one of the following diagnostic codes between January 1 st 2002 and December 31 st 2019: D13.7 (benign neoplasm in the endocrine part of the pancreas), C25.4 (malignant neoplasm in the endocrine part of the pancreas), and E16.1 (other hypoglycemia) and/or the following workup code: AB011 (fasting test)

GIST, gastrointestinal stromal tumor; IPMN, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm; NET, neuroendocrine tumor; PanNEN, pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; VGR, Västra Götaland Region; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide

Clinical characteristics of patients with insulinoma

The mean age at diagnosis was 56 ± 18 years (range 19–86), 63 ± 17 in women and 50 ± 16 in men (P = 0.03). Six of the 37 (16%) patients had metastatic insulinoma and 2 patients (5%) had a confirmed multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 syndrome. Other relevant characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Identification of eligible cases

The definition of malignancy corresponds to behavioral code 2 or 3 in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3). We collected total 78,069 patients with NENs coded as Class of Cases of 2 (diagnosed and treated in the registering hospital) and 3 (diagnosed in another hospital and treated in the registering hospital). Among the cases, we excluded the cases diagnosed as small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC; code number 80413). Histological Code numbers in NECs included 80,413 (small cell carcinoma, except lung), 80,133 (large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma), 82,433 (goblet cell carcinoid), 82,443 (adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma), 82,453 (adeno carcinoid tumor) and 82,463 (neuroendocrine carcinoma NOS). On contrary, 81,503 (pancreas neuroendocrine tumor), 82,403 (carcinoid NOS), 82,413 (enterochromaffin cell carcinoid), 82,493 (atypical carcinoid), 81,513 (insulinoma), 81,523 (enteroglucagonoma), 81,533 (gastrinoma), 81,543 (mixed pancreatic neuroendocrine-non-neuroexocrine tumor), 81,553 (vipoma) and 81,563 (somatostatinoma) were classed as histological types of NETs. Among them, 81,513 (insulinoma), 81,523 (enteroglucagonoma), 81,533 (gastrinoma), 81,543 (mixed pancreatic neuroendocrine-non-neuroexocrine tumor), 81,553 (vipoma) and 81,563 (somatostatinoma) were defined as functional NETs in the present study. UICC stages with TNM (6 th edition until 2011 and 7 th edition after 2012 year) was used for stage classification.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116Zuu6P]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pancreatic diabetes or diabetes in the context of disease of the exocrine pancreas — screening and treatment guidance: Recommendation 2.17 states to screen people for diabetes within 3–6 months after acute pancreatitis and annually thereafter, and to screen annually in chronic pancreatitis. For therapy in pancreatitis with diabetes, glucose-lowering therapies potentially associated with increased risk of pancreatitis (i.e., incretin based therapies) should be avoided, and early initiation of insulin therapy should be considered. In selected individuals with medically refractory chronic pancreatitis undergoing pancreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can be considered; in some cases this can lead to insulin independence, and in others it may decrease insulin requirements.

### Epidemiology and classification of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms using current coding criteria [^1137WpcK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This manuscript was completed in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement 27. The Hospital Review Board approved the study (2011/1659‐16) according to the general guidelines provided by the Regional Ethics Committee.

Population sample

Stavanger University Hospital, as the only hospital in the region, serves a catchment area of 18 municipalities in south‐western Norway. It provides healthcare services to a well defined population that has increased from approximately 290 000 inhabitants in 2003 to more than 350 000 in 2014 28. The study included all patients initially diagnosed with GEP‐NEN in this region during the 11‐year interval from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2013. All permanent residents of Norway are assigned an 11‐digit identification number in the National Population Registry. Any change of address must be reported to the National Population Registry within 8 days of moving. The hospital's patient administrative system is linked electronically to the National Population Registry 28, enabling continued contact for follow‐up assessments.

### Validation of an international classification of disease, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) algorithm in identifying severe hypoglycaemia events for real-world studies [^116mMYEq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The transition to the ICD-10-CM coding system has reduced the utility of hypoglycaemia algorithms based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in real-world studies of antidiabetic drugs. We mapped a validated ICD-9-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm to ICD-10-CM codes to create an ICD-10-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm and assessed its performance in identifying severe hypoglycaemia.

Materials and Methods

We assembled a cohort of Medicare patients with DM and linked electronic health record (EHR) data to the University of North Carolina Health System and identified candidate severe hypoglycaemia events from their Medicare claims using the ICD-10-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm. We confirmed severe hypoglycaemia by EHR review and computed a positive predictive value (PPV) of the algorithm to assess its performance. We refined the algorithm by removing poor performing codes (PPV ≤ 0.5) and computed a Cohen's κ statistic to evaluate the agreement of the EHR reviews.

Results

The algorithm identified 642 candidate severe hypoglycaemia events, and we confirmed 455 as true severe hypoglycaemia events, PPV of 0.709 (95% confidence interval: 0.672, 0.744). When we refined the algorithm, the PPV increased to 0.893 (0.862, 0.918) and missed < 2.42% (< 11) true severe hypoglycaemia events. Agreement between reviewers was high, κ ≥ 0.93 (0.89, 0.97).

Conclusions

We translated an ICD-9-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm to an ICD-10-CM version and found its performance was modest. The performance of the algorithm improved by removing poor performing codes at the trade-off of missing very few severe hypoglycaemia events. The algorithm has the potential to be used to identify severe hypoglycaemia in real-world studies of antidiabetic drugs.

### Symptom management for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: ASCO guideline [^115QGQFS]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, more specifically with respect to symptomatic management (insulinoma), ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding somatostatin analogs to the treatment plan in patients with insulinoma not responding to dietary changes and supportive medication, as an alternative to surgical resection or embolization, taking into account disease burden.

### Surgery for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-related insulinoma: long-term outcomes in a large international cohort [^114q9kg3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was an international collaboration between 40 hospitals in Europe and six in North America. Patients with MEN1 were identified in the hospital databases using ICD‐9/10 codes for MEN1 and insulinoma. Eligible patients underwent surgery for insulinoma between 1990 and 2016, had a pNET tumour confirmed histologically, and follow‐up for at least 1 year after surgery. The MEN1 diagnosis was established either by genetic testing, family history or clinically, according to most recent practice guidelines 2. Patients who underwent total pancreatectomy and those with distant metastases at diagnosis were excluded. Clinical and demographic data were collected by review of medical records in a standardized manner using predefined definitions. The medical records were examined by an investigator at the collaborating institution and discussed with the coordinating investigators. The study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committees or institutional review boards of all participating centres.

Insulinoma diagnosis

The presence of an insulinoma was based on a positive 72‐h supervised fasting test 18, 19. If no test was performed, the diagnosis was based on symptoms or signs of hypoglycaemia with concomitant biochemical endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, according to clinical practice guidelines 18, 19. The date of diagnosis was based on the date of the supervised 72‐h fasting test or the date of symptoms accompanied by endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.

Insulinoma localization

The evaluation for MEN1‐related insulinoma was dependent on the surgeon's preference and availability of localization techniques in each centre at the time of surgery. Generally, conventional imaging (CT, MRI, EUS) was undertaken before surgery, eventually followed by more invasive techniques, such as arterial (calcium) stimulation venous sampling or GLP‐1R receptor imaging. Most importantly, intraoperative findings, based on intraoperative ultrasonography and/or bimanual palpation, were used to localize the insulinoma and subsequently guide intraoperative surgical decision‐making.

Based on all preoperative and intraoperative findings, the insulinoma was localized to the pancreatic head or body/tail, or the surgeon suspected multifocal insulinomas in both the head and body/tail. Subsequent surgical decisions were based on whether during surgery the surgeon considered the insulinoma to be localized (suspected to be located in pancreatic head or body/tail) or possibly multifocal (insulinomas in both pancreatic head and body/tail).

### Current practices and novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary [^111LhQJk]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL IMPACT OF A NET-UP DIAGNOSIS

Because multidisciplinary approaches are common for the management of neuroendocrine neoplasms, a diagnosis of NET-UP can negatively impact patients throughout the continuum of care. In the absence of timely and accurate characterization of the neuroendocrine subtype, patients with NET-UPs may undergo diagnostic odysseys that subject them to multiple radiologic imaging tests, the possibility of more invasive surgery, and treatment plans that may not include new targeted therapies that are standard of care based on the subtype or anatomic primary site.

NET-UP Impact on Surgical Care

Specialized surgery optimized for individual NET subtypes is becoming standard of care, with the precise surgical plan and procedure dictated by the known or suspected anatomic primary site. For example, the surgical approach for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms depends on the tumor's differentiation state, with well-differentiated, functional pancreatic NETs requiring stabilization of hormone levels before surgery, whereas nonfunctional pancreatic NETs that are small (< 1 cm) may be better suited for monitoring without immediate surgery. Even within different types of functional pancreatic NETs, a splenectomy should be performed in patients with gastrinomas, whereas an insulinoma is likely to undergo enucleation. For some tumors, such as pheochromocytoma or medullary thyroid cancer, radiation therapy in addition to (or in lieu of) surgery may be warranted. In patients with small bowel NETs, a right hemicolectomy with node dissection is appropriate for patients with a primary tumor in the cecum, whereas an ileal tumor may require resection with node dissection and full bowel examination.

### European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society 2023 guidance paper for functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour syndromes [^114Yny8e]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

This ENETS guidance paper aims to provide practical advice to clinicians for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of functioning syndromes in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET). A NET-associated functioning syndrome is defined by the presence of a clinical syndrome combined with biochemical evidence of inappropriately elevated hormonal levels. Different hormonal syndromes can be encountered in pancreatic NET patients, including insulinoma, gastrinoma as well as the rare glucagonoma, VIPoma, ACTHoma, PTHrPoma, carcinoid syndrome, calcitoninoma, GHRHoma and somatostatinoma. The recommendations provided in this paper focus on the biochemical, genetic and imaging work-up as well as therapeutic management of the individual hormonal syndromes in well-differentiated, grade 1–3, functioning NET with the primary tumour originating in the pancreas, and for specific subtypes also in the duodenum.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117DBhQ3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

Hormone-secreting PanNETs — testing approach and chromogranin A considerations: these cases often require additional imaging, such as EUS and SSTR-based imaging; because many PanNETs secrete hormones, biochemical evaluation should also be considered in patients with PanNETs, and evaluation is generally guided by symptoms indicating excess hormone secretion, while screening for hormones in asymptomatic individuals is not routinely recommended; classic syndromes include insulinomas with fasting or nocturnal hypoglycemia and gastrinomas with recurrent peptic ulcers, with additional presentations including glucagonomas with hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus and/or migratory necrolytic erythema, somatostatinomas with hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus and/or diarrhea/steatorrhea, and VIPomas with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria; Chromogranin A levels are elevated in ≥ 60% of patients with either functioning or nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors, and levels elevated to twice the normal limit or higher are associated with shorter survival times for metastatic NETs (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.0; P < .001), and Chromogranin A was also found to be a prognostic factor in a prospective study of patients treated with everolimus; however, care should be taken because spuriously elevated levels have been reported in patients using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), those with renal or liver failure, those with hypertension, and those with chronic gastritis.

### Necrolytic migratory erythema… [^115woRu4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Glucagon-secreting tumors of the pancreatic islets produce a distinctive syndrome in which weight loss, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and prominent mucocutaneous findings occur. The cutaneous component — necrolytic migratory erythema — may be polymorphous, but most commonly manifests as erosions and crusts of the groin, perineum, buttocks, distal part of the extremities, and central area of the face. Alternatively, scaly papules and plaques may predominate in these areas. The eruption may resemble such dermatoses as pemphigus foliaceus, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic mucocutaneous condidiasis, psoriasis, and severe seborrheic dermatitis. Two patients with chronic, previously undiagnosed dermatoses had necrolytic migratory erythemia, which led to the discovery of glucagonomas present in each. In one patient surgical resection of the tumor resulted in total clearing of the rash within 48 hours.

Awareness of this distinctive entity may lead to early diagnosis and, possibly, cure. Kahan RS, Perez-Figaredo RA, Neimanis A. Necrolytic Migratory Erythema: Distinctive Dermatosis of the Glucagonoma Syndrome. Arch Dermatol. 1977; 113: 792–797.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) — diagnostic definitions and family risk are specified as follows: MEN1 "can be diagnosed in 3 ways" including "autosomal dominant genotype-positive MEN1", "clinical MEN1, defined by the manifestation of ≥ 2 cardinal MEN1 features without genetic confirmation", and "familial MEN1, defined by presence of an MEN1-associated tumor in a patient who has a first-degree relative with MEN1", and "first-degree relatives have a 50% risk of inheriting the condition". Mortality patterns note that "Two-thirds of patients with MEN1 syndrome die from an MEN1-related cause, and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are the most common disease-related cause of death: 40% to 45% of cases", and "Timely identification and intervention of MEN1-associated neoplasms are needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease".

### Glucagonoma and glucagonoma syndrome: an updated review [^117Nbtma]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Glucagonoma is a rare well‐differentiated slowly proliferating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, characterized by several manifestations including necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, diabetes and anaemia.

Aim

The purpose of the current review was to acknowledge literature about this rare tumour discerning the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glucagonoma by comparing three different periods.

Results

A study published by Song reviewed 216 cases from studies published between 1999 and 2016, making a comparison with 407 cases reported before 1998 by Soga and Yakuwa. The current review consisted of 86 cases reported in studies published in and after 2017: 40 males and 46 females, with an average age of 48.2 years. The male‐to‐female ratio was 0.87. The rate of typical clinical findings was as follows: NME, 93.2% (69/74); DM, 70.3% (50/74); weight loss, 62.2% (46/74); anaemia, 44.6% (33/74); glossitis or stomatitis or cheilitis, 31.1% (23/74). A total of 85 cases reported the location of the tumour as the pancreas and 38.8% of these cases involved the tail of the pancreas. The average tumour size was 4.6 cm in patients between 2017 and 2024. Metastasis was detected in 52.3% of patients (45/86). The comparison with previous series highlighted an earlier age of diagnosis of glucagonoma and a higher rate of NME, consistent with a higher diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

Glucagonoma is a rare pathology, with peculiar characteristics that need to be acknowledged to achieve a timely diagnosis and finally improve patient prognosis.

### A unique case of glucagonoma with atypical necrolytic migratory erythema [^1179NnVx]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. This typically shows interface dermatitis with basal layer damage and mucin deposition, not psoriasiform changes with keratinocyte necrosis.
B. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma – Incorrect. CTCL usually presents with epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes and Pautrier microabscesses, which were not seen on biopsy.
C. IBD-related dermatosis – Incorrect. Common IBD-associated skin findings like pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum do not match this patient's psoriasiform histology and chronic serpiginous eruption.
D. Glucagonoma – Correct. The characteristic psoriasiform histology pattern with conspicuous keratinocyte necrosis and lack of response to biologics suggests necrolytic migratory erythema from an existing glucagonoma. Other options are inconsistent with chronicity and biopsy findings.
E. Amyopathic dermatomyositis – Incorrect – This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of muscle involvement, systemic symptoms, and lack of classic histologic features such as interface dermatitis or mucin.

Clinical question: Which skin biopsy histological feature should raise suspicion of a glucagonoma or other nutritional deficiency?
A. Neutrophilic inflammation with leukocytoclasia
B. Necrobiotic granulomas surrounded by palisaded lymphocytes and histiocytes
C. Conspicuous keratinocyte necrosis
D. Interface dermatitis with Civatte bodies
E. Perivascular dermatitis with plasma cells

Correct answer: (C) Conspicuous keratinocyte necrosis.

While the presence of spongiotic and then psoriasiform dermatitis in the biopsies is nonspecific, conspicuous keratinocyte necrosis is a feature that should raise the suspicion for a nutritional deficiency, NME, or NAE.

Further workup revealed an elevated glucagon level (1248 pg/mL) and diffuses hypoaminoacidemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a pancreatic mass, and biopsy diagnosed a glucagonoma. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, with pathology confirming no lymph node involvement. Postoperative positron emission tomography/CT indicated no residual disease, and her symptoms resolved. Figs 4 and 5 below show resolution of the patient's rash following surgical resection.

2.4 Outcome definitions

Potential AP cases were initially identified by ICD‐9 code 577.0, which does not include chronic pancreatitis, cysts or pseudocysts of the pancreas, or other diseases of the pancreas. Because the positive predictive value (PPV) for AP is typically low, 27 medical charts were reviewed by a gastroenterologist. The algorithm for confirming AP as "definite" or "probable" included:
Report of abdominal pain and;
Lipase levels ≥ 3× upper limit normal (ULN) or 300 units per liter (U/L) (if normal range not noted) or amylase levels ≥ 5× ULN or 1000 U/L (if normal range not noted) and/or;
Imaging diagnostic for, or suggestive of, AP. 28

Definite cases (three of the three criteria) and probable cases (criterion 1 and criterion 2 or 3) were considered confirmed cases. Final analyses included cases of AP that were confirmed through this medical chart review/adjudication.

PC cases were identified, employing a validated algorithm (PPV of 0.88 [95% CI 0.62‐0.98]) 29 which required all of the following criteria:
Claim with an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of PC (ICD‐9157.xx)
No diagnosis of benign pancreatic neoplasm within 60 days after PC diagnosis
Procedures indicating pancreatic surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 180 days after PC diagnosis
No diagnosis of other cancers (ICD‐9150.xx‐156.xx, 158.xx, 159.xx, 162.xx, 165.xx, 171.5, 188.xx, 195.2) within 60 days before or after PC diagnosis

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^111TRHzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Incidence and Epidemiology

Insulinomas are the most common, yet still rare, hormone-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNEN) with a reported incidence of 0.7 to 4 cases per million per year. There is an age-specific incidence peak in the fifth decade of life in men and the sixth decade of life in women and the incidence is slightly higher in women than in men. More than 99% of insulinomas are located in the pancreas, where its tumor locations are evenly distributed. Extrapancreatic (occasionally metastatic) insulinomas are extremely rare and have been described in the lung, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, hilum of the spleen, and gastric antrum. Approximately 10% of insulinomas present as multiple lesions. Because the definitions for malignancy in insulinoma are ambiguous, nonmetastatic insulinomas are now referred to as "indolent" and metastatic insulinomas as "aggressive" (see Treatment of Metastatic or Inoperable Aggressive Insulinoma). Approximately 10% to 15% of insulinomas belong to the aggressive category and 85% to 90% can be considered as indolent. Patients with an aggressive insulinoma have lower survival compared with patients with an indolent insulinoma. The 5-year survival of patients with an indolent insulinoma has been reported to be 94% to 100% and for patients with an aggressive insulinoma this amounts to 24% to 67%. Secondary, or metachronous insulin secretion by panNEN that previously were nonsecreting, or secreting other peptide hormones, can also occasionally develop and is generally associated with a poor survival as compared with their non-insulin-secreting counterparts.

A total of 5% to 10% of insulinomas are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. The MEN1-related insulinomas may develop as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions and are generally diagnosed at an earlier age than their sporadic counterparts because of application of the MEN1 screening recommendations. Routine genetic testing for MEN1 is usually not recommended in patients with newly diagnosed insulinoma, but a thorough medical and family history should be obtained, and patients should be referred for appropriate testing if there is suspicion of the insulinoma being 1 of the manifestations of MEN1. A recent Delphi consensus recommends to consider MEN1 screening in patients aged 35 or younger who present with an apparently sporadic insulinoma, although this is not yet supported by the literature. Other genetic syndromes associated with the development of insulinomas are neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex.

Persons with 1–3 encounters had T2DM sensitivity of 93.0% (95% CI 90.2% to 95.8%) and T2DM specificity of 94.7% (95% CI 92.9% to 96.4%). Persons with 4–6 encounters had T2DM sensitivity and specificity of 88.9% (95% CI 84.3% to 93.5%) and 97.1% (95% CI 95.9% to 98.4%), respectively. Persons with ≥ 7 encounters had T2DM sensitivity and specificity of 87. 9% (95% CI 82.8% to 93.0%) and 97.0% (95% CI 95.6% to 98.3%), respectively. AUC and accuracy were similar across groups with different number of encounters. The sensitivity of classifying diabetes type using endocrinology encounters and other encounters was 85.7% (95% CI 81.6% to 89.8%) and 91.2% (95% CI 88.8% to 93.5%), respectively. PPV using endocrinology encounters was 81.6% (95% CI 77.1% to 86.0%), and PPV using other encounters was 89.8% (95% CI 87.3% to 92.2%). The accuracy was approximately 95% for both.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113sBqLQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Principles of systemic anti-tumor therapy — pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (well-differentiated grade 1/2) state that systemic therapy may not be appropriate for every patient with locoregional advanced and/or distant metastatic disease. Consider multidisciplinary discussion to determine the best choice of treatment, including: observation for patients with stable disease with mild tumor burden, locoregional therapy, cytoreductive surgery, or systemic therapy. Currently, there are no data to support a specific sequence of regional versus systemic therapy and no data to guide sequencing of the following systemic therapy options, and there is no known role for systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting for PanNETs. Doses and schedules are subject to appropriate modifications depending on the circumstances, and for management of hormone-related symptoms and complications, see PanNET-1 through PanNET-10.

### Resolution of necrolytic migratory erythema with somatostatin analogue in a patient diagnosed with pancreatic glucagonoma [^114qVWR4]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 70-year-old man reported progressive weight loss, fatigue and a generalised rash. The rash was consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema, further investigations were performed and the patient was diagnosed with a mass in the tail of the pancreas, in keeping with a localised glucagonoma. Somatostatin analogue therapy was started for symptom control, leading to complete resolution of the skin rash and an improvement in constitutional symptoms. Subsequently, the pancreatic lesion was excised, and pathology assessment confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour with high expression of glucagon compatible with glucagonoma.

### Diagnostic challenge of glucagonoma: case report and literature review [^117RXZWK]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the diagnostic difficulties encountered in a case of glucagonoma.

Methods

We provide a literature review and present the clinical findings, pertinent laboratory data, and results of related studies in a patient with a glucagonoma.

Results

A 54-year-old-man, with no relevant history of endocrine disorders, presented to the hospital with a 5-year history of recurrent stomatitis and glossitis, a more recent weight loss of 11.5 kg, and recurrent pruritic maculae on the scalp in conjunction with raised erythematous maculae in the scrotal region and perineum that gradually migrated to the distal extremities, becoming bullous and painful. The patient was hospitalized, and because of the dermatologic findings suggestive of necrolytic migratory erythema, the presence of a glucagonoma was suspected. His blood glucose levels were in the normal range. Glucagon levels were found to be elevated, and imaging studies confirmed the presence of an enlarged mass in the pancreatic tail, without evidence of extension to surrounding structures. Liver metastatic lesions were also excluded. After surgical removal of the tumor, the skin and oral mucosal lesions disappeared spontaneously. The histologic appearance and immunohistochemical staining results confirmed the diagnosis of a glucagonoma. Subsequently, all related symptoms resolved, and the glucagon levels normalized.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of glucagonoma is often delayed. Clinicians should be aware of the unusual initial manifestations of this tumor and the potential for less than a full spectrum of the characteristic features of the glucagonoma syndrome.

### Metastatic glucagonoma: treatment with liver transplantation [^111TQRfR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Glucagonoma is a rare pancreatic endocrine tumor that is often both well developed and malignant at detection. In the case of metastatic spread the patient has a poor long-term prognosis. We hope to familiarize dermatologists and other specialists with this rare and potentially fatal disorder because early recognition of necrolytic migratory erythema, a clinical feature that may appear in patients with glucagonoma, can lead to possible cure, whereas delayed identification of the disease is associated with metastatic disease and a poor prognosis. We report the case of a 57-year-old patient with a metastatic glucagon-producing tumor; necrolytic migratory erythema was diagnosed and was successfully treated by a multimodal intervention including liver transplantation. Currently, 72 months after transplantation, our patient is in complete remission, which has been verified by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy monitoring, computed tomographic scanning and glucagon serum control. Increased awareness of the clinical symptoms and visible polymorphic mucocutaneous and nonspecific histopathologic features of glucagonoma syndrome is needed to avoid unnecessary delay in the diagnosis of this syndrome.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Nonfunctioning incidental pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: who, when, and how to treat? [^116r2EoG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are indolent, slow-growing tumors, and surveillance is safe and reasonable. Despite consensus, size may be less important than grade and Ki-67 when making decisions regarding optimal therapy. Plans to proceed with surveillance or surgical resection require a multidisciplinary approach and a shared decision making process with colleagues, patients, and families. Decisions should be based on tumor characteristics, patient morbidities, preferences, and risks. As molecular diagnostics evolve, preoperative acquisition of tissue samples may become even more critical in choosing between operative management and surveillance.

### Epidemiology and classification of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms using current coding criteria [^115a9pan]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

The lack of uniform criteria for coding of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasia has hampered previous epidemiological studies. The epidemiology ofwas investigated in this study using currently available criteria.

Methods

All patients diagnosed withbetween January 2003 and December 2013 in a well defined Norwegian population of approximately 350 000 people were included. Age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidence rates were calculated. The current 2010 World Health Organization criteria, European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society classification and International Union Against Cancer classification were used.

Results

A total of 204 patients (114 male, 55.9 per cent) were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 61 (range 10–94) years. The annual overall crude incidence was 5.83 per 100 000 inhabitants, with an increasing trend (0.033). The most frequent location was small intestine (60 patients, 29.4 per cent) followed by appendix (48 patients, 23.5 per cent) and pancreas (33 patients, 16.2 per cent). Grade 1 tumours were more common in gastrointestinal (100 patients, 58.5 per cent) than in pancreatic (9 patients, 27 per cent). According to theclassification, 77 patients (37.7 per cent) had stage I, 17 patients (8.3 per cent) stage, 37 patients (18.1 per cent) stageand 70 patients (34.3 per cent) had stagedisease. No patient with stage I disease had grade 3 tumours; advanced tumour grade increased with stage.

Conclusion

A high crude incidence of, at 5.83 per 100 000 inhabitants, was noted together with a significant increasing trend over time.
