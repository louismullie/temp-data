## Question

Why are neutrophils low and lymphocytes high

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why neutrophils are low and lymphocytes are high. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and severity thresholds for neutropenia and lymphocytosis. Then, I should verify the major pathophysiological mechanisms that can simultaneously depress neutrophils and elevate lymphocytes. Next, I will categorize etiologies by mechanism and highlight key exemplars. After that, I need to outline a practical diagnostic approach, including when to use smear, flow cytometry, bone marrow, and genetic testing. Finally, I should consider management principles and infection risk stratification, while double-checking for pitfalls and exceptions that could mislead the workup.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't anchor on a misclassification. Neutropenia is typically defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL, with severity bands of mild 1000–1499, moderate 500–999, and severe less than 500, which carry escalating infection risk and guide urgency of evaluation and prophylaxis decisions [^111NDrP5] [^112AFUL1]. Lymphocytosis in adults is generally an absolute lymphocyte count greater than 4000/μL, though relative lymphocytosis can occur when neutrophils fall and lymphocytes remain normal, so I need to check absolute counts before concluding true lymphocytosis.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the pathophysiological buckets that plausibly explain both low neutrophils and high lymphocytes. The main mechanisms include immune-mediated destruction of neutrophils with compensatory or clonal lymphoproliferation, bone marrow failure or suppression with lymphoid expansion, viral infections with neutrophil consumption and lymphocyte activation, and drug-induced myelotoxicity with immune modulation, each of which can present with this dual abnormality depending on timing and context [^111Q1zfB] [^114vGZZh].

> I will now examine immune-mediated neutrophil destruction with lymphoproliferation, because this is a classic pattern. Autoimmune neutropenia, whether primary or secondary to systemic autoimmunity, reduces neutrophil survival via autoantibodies and/or cytotoxic T cells, while chronic immune activation can drive clonal T-cell expansions such as T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia or related clonal T-cell proliferations, producing a relative or absolute lymphocytosis and sometimes neutropenia as a direct immune effect [^113aBFHH] [^117N6nVj] [^113nJxhT]. Wait, let me verify the spectrum point: some patients with clonal T-LGL have only mild cytopenias and are labeled TCUS, so I should confirm clonality by flow cytometry and TCR studies when suspected, especially if cytopenias are chronic and unexplained [^113nJxhT] [^117N6nVj].

> Next, I should review bone marrow failure and suppression scenarios, because impaired myelopoiesis with lymphoid expansion can mimic this pattern. Severe congenital neutropenia and other inherited marrow failure syndromes cause maturation arrest of myeloid precursors, lowering ANC, while the lymphocyte compartment may be normal or expanded as a compensatory phenomenon or due to immune dysregulation; in some cases, lymphopenia coexists, so I need to check the specific syndrome and lineage details carefully [^111fH5k6] [^1161KPyr]. But wait, what if the marrow is infiltrated? Lymphoid malignancies such as CLL can replace marrow space, suppressing granulopoiesis and elevating circulating lymphocytes, producing true lymphocytosis with neutropenia; I should confirm clonality and phenotype with flow cytometry and assess marrow if cytopenias are significant or progressive [^111xbocB].

> Let me consider viral infections next, because they often deplete neutrophils and activate or expand lymphocytes. SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes lymphopenia, but I should double-check that some cohorts also document neutropenia, and that post-viral immune dysregulation can transiently depress neutrophils while lymphocyte counts recover or fluctuate, so timing relative to infection matters [^115A4cSB]. Epstein-Barr virus and CMV can drive absolute lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and in the setting of systemic viral illness, neutrophil margination and accelerated apoptosis may lower ANC, yielding a pattern of relative lymphocytosis or even absolute lymphocytosis with neutropenia depending on the phase of illness [^11357oPF] [^113Y9xBJ].

> I need to check drug-induced mechanisms, because many agents suppress myelopoiesis while modulating lymphocyte trafficking or survival. Cytotoxic chemotherapy predictably causes neutropenia, and early or baseline lymphopenia has been identified as a risk factor for febrile neutropenia, underscoring how lymphocyte depletion can coexist with neutropenia in the chemo setting; I should confirm regimen and timing before inferring mechanism [^113S4TEj] [^111nx9SJ]. Rituximab and obinutuzumab can cause late-onset neutropenia weeks to months after exposure, and chlorambucil produces dose-related neutropenia with a risk of irreversible marrow injury at higher cumulative doses; these B-cell–directed therapies can also alter lymphocyte subsets, so I must correlate with timing and prior counts [^114Uu6Ka] [^1144kQmf] [^114vGZZh]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can precipitate immune-related neutropenia mediated by T cells, and guidelines recommend steroids plus G-CSF for severe cases; I should confirm irAE timing and exclude other causes before labeling it ICI-related [^113YUf8f] [^111BkD9h] [^112YiTwo].

> Let me synthesize exemplar entities that classically show low neutrophils with high lymphocytes. T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia presents with neutropenia and lymphocytosis due to cytotoxic T-cell–mediated myeloid destruction and clonal T-cell expansion; flow cytometry shows a CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic phenotype and TCR clonality confirms the diagnosis, and I should keep an eye out for associated autoimmunity [^117N6nVj] [^113nJxhT]. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can produce marked lymphocytosis with neutropenia from marrow infiltration and immune mechanisms; I should confirm monoclonal B-cell expansion and stage disease before deciding on therapy, noting that ALC alone is not an indication to treat in the absence of symptoms or other indications [^114cbHm9] [^111xbocB]. Autoimmune neutropenia, whether primary or secondary to SLE or other autoimmune disease, reduces neutrophil survival via autoantibodies and sometimes T-cell cytotoxicity, while chronic immune activation may expand memory T cells, contributing to a higher lymphocyte fraction even if absolute lymphocytes are not frankly elevated [^113aBFHH] [^114vdL7R].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss a reversible cause. First, confirm the abnormality with a repeat CBC with differential and a careful peripheral smear to distinguish reactive from clonal lymphocytes and to look for dysplasia, blasts, or toxic neutrophil changes; this step often separates benign from malignant processes and guides the need for further testing [^111xbocB] [^111Q1zfB]. Next, I should review history for infections, autoimmune symptoms, medications including cytotoxics, biologics, and ICIs, and family history of cytopenias; then obtain targeted labs such as ANA, viral serologies including HIV, EBV, and CMV, and, if clonal lymphocytosis is suspected, flow cytometry for lymphocyte immunophenotyping and TCR/BCR rearrangement studies [^113Y9xBJ] [^1117VWXr]. If cytopenias are severe, persistent, or unexplained, I should proceed to bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to assess cellularity, infiltration, dysplasia, and cytogenetics, and consider next-generation sequencing panels for inherited neutropenia or immune dysregulation when clinical suspicion is high [^111Q1zfB] [^114ZVGru].

> I need to ensure I address infection risk and management thresholds. Severe neutropenia with ANC less than 500/μL confers a high risk of bacterial and fungal infections and warrants prompt evaluation of fever as a medical emergency with broad-spectrum antibiotics per febrile neutropenia pathways; even in the absence of fever, severe neutropenia merits hematology input and consideration of G-CSF depending on etiology and chronicity [^112AFUL1] [^111N4GXd]. For immune-mediated neutropenia, including ICI-related cases, treatment with corticosteroids plus G-CSF is standard, and durable responses often require immunosuppression tailored to the underlying mechanism; I should double-check for concurrent autoimmune cytopenias and adjust therapy accordingly [^113YUf8f] [^113aBFHH]. In CLL and other indolent lymphoproliferative disorders, observation is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with mild cytopenias, but progressive or symptomatic disease should be treated per disease-specific guidelines, with attention to infection prophylaxis during therapy [^114cbHm9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked a potential pitfall: transient stress lymphocytosis can raise the lymphocyte count and, by differential effects, make neutrophils appear relatively low even when absolute neutrophil counts are normal; I should confirm absolute counts and correlate with recent stressors, trauma, or acute illness before concluding there is true neutropenia and lymphocytosis [^113Np2wx]. Also, I should remember that some patients have benign ethnic neutropenia with ANCs around 1000–1500/μL and no excess infections; in those cases, a relative lymphocytosis is common and typically benign, so I must integrate clinical context and personal baseline counts before escalating testing [^116Jmxmd].

> In summary, I should confirm that the simultaneous pattern of low neutrophils and high lymphocytes arises from intersecting mechanisms: immune-mediated neutrophil destruction with lymphoproliferation, marrow failure or suppression with lymphoid expansion, viral immune modulation, or drug-induced myelotoxicity and immune effects; a structured workup with smear review, targeted serologies, flow cytometry, and marrow evaluation as indicated, alongside careful medication and infection histories, will reliably separate benign from malignant and guide therapy, reducing the risk of misattribution and ensuring timely intervention when needed [^111Q1zfB] [^111xbocB] [^113Y9xBJ].

Low neutrophils (neutropenia) and high lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) most often reflect **viral infections** (e.g. COVID-19, EBV, CMV, HIV) [^114vGZZh] [^11357oPF] that suppress neutrophil production or increase apoptosis while driving lymphocyte proliferation [^11357oPF]. Other causes include **autoimmune disorders** (e.g. SLE, RA, T-LGL leukemia) [^114vdL7R] [^117N6nVj] with immune-mediated neutrophil destruction and clonal or reactive lymphocytosis, and **bone marrow disorders** (e.g. CLL, lymphoma, MDS) [^114cbHm9] [^113tHbyY] that replace or suppress neutrophil production while expanding lymphocytes. Medications (e.g. chemo, rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine) [^114vGZZh] [^114Uu6Ka] and radiation can also cause marrow suppression or immune dysregulation [^1126y3oz]. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, peripheral smear, viral serologies, autoimmune testing, and bone marrow biopsy if indicated [^111Q1zfB] [^113tHbyY].

## Infectious causes

Viral infections commonly cause neutropenia and lymphocytosis via **bone marrow suppression** or **immune-mediated destruction** of neutrophils, alongside lymphocyte activation or proliferation [^1126XPJp] [^11357oPF].

- **COVID-19**: Lymphopenia is common, but neutropenia can occur, especially in severe cases [^111Ge6pq] [^115A4cSB].

- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: Can cause lymphocytosis and neutropenia [^11357oPF].
- **Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)**: Causes lymphopenia and neutropenia via immune destruction and marrow suppression [^112LhQYU].

---

## Autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders

Autoimmune conditions can destroy neutrophils and alter lymphocyte counts via **autoantibodies**, **cytokine dysregulation**, or **clonal lymphoproliferation** [^114vdL7R].

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Neutropenia and lymphopenia are common; lymphocytosis can occur in some cases [^114vdL7R] [^115JmiBA].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: Neutropenia can occur, often with lymphopenia rather than lymphocytosis [^117LFU89].

- **Autoimmune neutropenia**: Direct neutrophil destruction by autoantibodies [^112cu6ns].

---

## Hematological malignancies

Bone marrow disorders can suppress neutrophil production while expanding lymphocytes, leading to **neutropenia with lymphocytosis** [^117N6nVj].

- **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**: Lymphocytosis with neutropenia due to marrow infiltration and immune mechanisms [^114cbHm9].
- **Lymphomas**: Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can cause lymphocytosis and neutropenia [^notfound].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Ineffective hematopoiesis causing neutropenia; lymphocytosis can occur [^112LhQYU].

---

## Medications and treatments

Several drugs suppress neutrophil production or increase destruction, while altering lymphocyte counts through **immune modulation** or **direct toxicity** [^114vGZZh].

- **Chemotherapy**: Suppresses myelopoiesis, causing neutropenia; lymphopenia is common, but some regimens cause lymphocytosis [^113S4TEj].
- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, and others can cause neutropenia and lymphopenia or lymphocytosis [^114vGZZh].
- **Rituximab**: Late-onset neutropenia can occur, sometimes with lymphocytosis [^114Uu6Ka].
- **Radiation therapy**: Can cause neutropenia and lymphopenia or lymphocytosis depending on timing and dose [^1126y3oz].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Deficiencies can impair hematopoiesis, causing **neutropenia**, while lymphocyte counts may be less affected or increased due to immune activation [^notfound].

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Causes neutropenia and altered lymphocyte function [^notfound].
- **Folate deficiency**: Similar to B12 deficiency, causing neutropenia and lymphocyte abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured evaluation** is essential to identify the cause:

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Confirms neutropenia and lymphocytosis and provides initial clues [^111NDrP5].
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assesses cell morphology, blasts, or abnormal lymphocytes [^111xbocB].
- **Viral serologies**: HIV, EBV, CMV, hepatitis B/C, and SARS-CoV-2 testing [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, anti-neutrophil antibodies, rheumatoid factor [^112cu6ns].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: If hematologic malignancy or marrow failure is suspected [^111xbocB].
- **Flow cytometry**: Detects clonal lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. CLL, T-LGL) [^111xbocB].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Neutropenia increases **infection risk**, especially bacterial and fungal, and may require **G-CSF** or antimicrobial prophylaxis [^116gj9Ri]. Lymphocytosis reflects immune activation or clonal proliferation and may require **targeted therapy** if malignant. Management depends on the underlying cause: treat infections, autoimmune disease, or malignancy; adjust or stop offending drugs; and provide supportive care, including growth factors and infection prophylaxis [^116mUTXQ].

---

Low neutrophils with high lymphocytes reflect diverse causes — infections, autoimmune disease, malignancy, drugs, and nutritional deficits — and require a **focused diagnostic workup** to guide therapy and reduce complications.

### Are clonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes to blame for unexplained haematological abnormalities? [^113nJxhT]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormalities diagnosed on routine blood work, such as mild neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and relative lymphocytosis, often have obscure aetiologies. A series of 30 patients were evaluated for various unexplained haematological abnormalities between 1997 and 2005, and found to have circulating monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). These patients fit the diagnosis of T-cell clonopathy of unknown significance (TCUS), which may represent a clinical spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation. Our patients were characterised by a complete absence of severe neutropenia (< 0.5 × 10⁹/l), absence of recurrent neutropenic infection (0%), negative rheumatoid serology (0%) and a low incidence of constitutional symptoms (20%). This overall asymptomatic clinical presentation appeared to be different from other previously reported series of TCUS or T-LGL leukaemia who typically had symptomatology and required treatment. Our series of 30 patients represented the benign end of the spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation, and might reflect diagnosis at earlier stages of the condition relative to other reported series. TCUS may be a heterogeneous and under-diagnosed condition. This study further broadens our understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of indolent clonal T-cell proliferation, and raises our awareness of this condition. We suggest that TCUS should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained haematological problems.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^112gi4vA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

Unravelling the cause of a neutropenia poses a complex diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis ranges from life threatening disease to transient benign causes of little clinical significance. This review offers a practical guide to investigating the neutropenic child, and highlights features that merit specialist referral. Therapeutic options, the role of long term follow up, and the complications of severe chronic neutropenia are considered.

### Independent associations of lymphopenia and neutropenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal, multinational study [^114vdL7R]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leucopenia is commonly observed in patients with SLE, with a reported prevalence of leucopenia between 22 and 42%. The presence of leucopenia is incorporated in many versions of SLE classification criteria, but sub-setting of leucopenia in these is mostly in relation to lymphopenia. Less is known about neutropenia in SLE.

The pathogenesis of leucopenia in SLE is not well understood; however, different mechanisms have been proposed. Peripheral destruction from lymphotoxic or anti-neutrophil antibody effects, complement-mediated cell lysis and excessive neutrophil apoptosis, as well as marrow suppression, have been postulated. The attribution of leucopenia to SLE disease activity is relatively easy to recognize before treatment but can become challenging when patients have been treated with immunosuppressive therapy with potential myelosuppressive effects. There remain knowledge gaps regarding the prevalence and clinical associations of leucopenia in SLE. In this study, we sought to examine the associations of disease characteristics and medication use with lymphopenia and neutropenia in a multi-ethnic international longitudinal lupus cohort.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^111Q1zfB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^113j6knz]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10⁹/l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder. This review focuses on the key clinical finding and laboratory tests for diagnosis with commentaries on treatment, particularly the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to treat childhood neutropenia.

### Baseline and early lymphopenia predict for the risk of febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy [^113S4TEj]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Febrile grade four (PMN ≤ 500 μl⁻¹) neutropenia (FN) is a frequent complication of cancer chemotherapy, which causes death in 4–21% of patients in large studies. The risk of FN after administration of chemotherapy not only depends on the type and doses of drugs administered, but also on individual risk factors for each patient, such as performance status (PS), coexisting infections or underlying immunosuppression. Hence, even after the administration of a dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen, 30–50% of the patients will not experience FN, while conversely, FN will occur in 2–15% of the patients who receive chemotherapy regimens with conventional doses of drugs.

The identification of simple and readily available clinical and biological risk factors for FN after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy is an important goal for the selection of candidate patients for prophylactic measures to FN, in particular administration of granulocyte growth factors. We previously reported that the occurrence of an early lymphopenia (≤ 700 μl⁻¹) at day 5 following the administration of chemotherapy was an independent risk factor for FN along with the type of chemotherapy regimen in four series of patients treated in comprehensive cancer centres. In this prognostic model, a high-risk subgroup of patients with both risk factors (i.e. receiving 'high-risk' chemotherapy and with a day 5 lymphocyte count ≤ 700 μl⁻¹) was identified, with an observed incidence of FN of 69%. This subgroup includes 62% of patients who experienced FN in this previous study. This model is currently used as inclusion criteria in a prospective randomised study comparing the use of G-CSF in primary or secondary prophylaxis. However, the use of day 5 lymphocyte count for the quantification of the risk of FN was found to be not optimally practical for outpatient care, since the patient is identified at high risk after having left the hospital. Although day 1 lymphocytes count was not significantly correlated to the risk of FN in the previous study, the observed incidence of FN in this subgroup was > 40%, suggesting that it may have been missed because of a lack of power of the study. Supporting this hypothesis, baseline day 1 lymphopenia was found to be an independent risk factor for other haematological toxicities, in particular severe anaemia (Ray-Coquard et al, 1999), severe thrombopenia and early death after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

### Acute and chronic neutropenias. what is new? [^117HP3Eq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recently, some of the mechanisms and consequences in the severe chronic neutropenias (e.g. the neutrophil elastase gene mutations and the risk to progress to myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia) and in drug-induced agranulocytosis (e.g. the apoptosis-inducing ability of metabolites of clozapine) have been elucidated, and new aspects of autoimmune and the large granular lymphocyte syndrome were described (e.g. aberrant elaboration of Fas-ligand causing neutrophil apoptosis). Investigations of the mild to moderate chronic neutropenias have shown the significance of interactions between the myeloid development and the immune network (e.g. relations to immunoglobulin aberrations). Granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) is widely used in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, however, its use in other conditions is mostly based on anecdotal evidence. In addition, immune modulating regimens, such as metothrexate, ciclosporine and monoclonal antibodies, are increasingly employed for the autoimmune neutropenias.

### Update on childhood neutropenia: molecular and clinical advances [^111fJLoK]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital and inherited disorders are important differential diagnoses of neutropenia, particularly in neonates and children, although acquired causes are more common. This article focuses on recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular defects in inherited neutropenias as well as issues that are related to clinical presentation, diagnosis, and complications.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^111NDrP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Leukemia: an overview for primary care [^1113Q9nd]. American Family Physician (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect common causes such as infection, inflammation, and stress response when evaluating a patient with leukocytosis. Obtain peripheral blood smear in patients with a WBC count > 20, 000/mcL and with associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, or constitutional symptoms.

### Autoimmune and other acquired neutropenias [^113aBFHH]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

This educational review addresses the diagnostic evaluation of patients for autoimmune and other forms of acquired neutropenia, including the futility of deconstructing the overlap of chronic "autoimmune", "benign", and "idiopathic" categories. Isolated neutropenias caused by infection, drugs, and immunologic disorders are also addressed. Discussion of management options emphasizes a conservative approach, with largely supportive care for these mostly benign and self-limited disorders.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^112DkwX6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We performed the meta-analysis by using Review Manager software version 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). We calculated mean differences (MDs) between groups for continuous variables and reported 95% CIs for both severe and nonsevere cases. If the included studies provided medians and interquartile ranges instead of MDs and SDs, we imputed the MDs and SDs as described previously and additionally described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. We considered results statistically insignificant if p > 0.05 or if the MD included zero. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using the I 2 statistic and awarded the following values: 0%–24%, homogeneity; 25%–49%, mild heterogeneity; 50%–74%, moderate heterogeneity; and > 75%, high heterogeneity. If moderate to high heterogeneity was present (I 2 > 50%), then we used the random effects model to pool the effect sizes of included studies and subgroup analyses.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^11285AhP]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia in IEI are multifactorial. They are commonly attributed to cell‐mediated and humoral immune dysfunction or dysregulation, driving autoimmunity and autoinflammation. However, non‐immune causes should also be considered. B‐ and T‐cell responses have a complex interdependent relationship, primary defects resulting in altered maturation and regulation with subsequent decreased number and function. Haemophagocytosis is an important cause of cytopenia, particularly in the paediatric population, and may herald an underlying primary aetiology. Secondary factors such as splenic sequestration and bone‐marrow infiltration by malignancy or infection are non‐immune causes that should not be overlooked (Figure 1).,

FIGURE 1
Mechanisms contributing to cytopenia in inborn errors of immunity (IEI). (A) The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia are multifactorial and include: humoral and cell‐mediated immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation, haemophagocytosis, splenic sequestration (secondary to abnormal lymphoproliferation), bone‐marrow dysfunction including ineffective maturation, myelodysplasia, primary bone‐marrow failure and myelosuppression due to secondary infections and bone‐marrow infiltration.(B) Cytoskeletal dysfunction with megakaryocyte dysfunction, increased apoptosis and splenic platelet destruction. Contributory causes of non‐immune thrombocytopenia in IEI include: increased clearance and apoptosis; myelosuppression by infections, myelofibrosis/bone‐marrow malignancy, cytotoxic drugs or transplant are also contributory.(C) Defective myeloid cell differentiation or release of granulocytes from the bone marrow, enhanced apoptosis and increased destruction of peripheral‐blood granulocytes are the main physiological mechanisms underlying chronic severe or intermittent neutropenia in primary immunodeficiency patients.(D) Lymphopenia driven by B‐ and T‐cell‐intrinsic defect with abnormal maturation and defective function, negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus as well as defects in the number or function of regulatory T‐cells, impaired apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, loss or breakage of tolerance, increased lymphoid production and cytokine secretion which likely also drives the immune dysregulation and associated autoimmune cytopenia.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### New monogenic disorders identify more pathways to neutropenia: from the clinic to next-generation sequencing [^114ZVGru]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the most common type of leukocyte in human circulating blood and constitute one of the chief mediators for innate immunity. Defined as a reduction from a normal distribution of values, neutropenia results from a number of congenital and acquired conditions. Neutropenia may be insignificant, temporary, or associated with a chronic condition with or without a vulnerability to life-threatening infections. As an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, neutropenia may be associated with transformation to myeloid malignancy. Recognition of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome may be delayed into adulthood. The list of monogenic neutropenia disorders is growing, heterogeneous, and bewildering. Furthermore, greater knowledge of immune-mediated and drug-related causes makes the diagnosis and management of neutropenia challenging. Recognition of syndromic presentations and especially the introduction of next-generation sequencing are improving the accuracy and expediency of diagnosis as well as their clinical management. Furthermore, identification of monogenic neutropenia disorders is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of granulopoiesis and myeloid malignancies.

### Hematologic considerations in kidney transplantation: core curriculum 2025 [^113FwBxn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematologic abnormalities including both cytopenias and cytoses are the rule rather than the exception in the first year after kidney transplantation, yet many are benign reflections of immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, or residual chronic kidney disease. In this Core Curriculum, we distill the evidence on the disorders clinicians encounter most often, cytopenias including neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathy, as well as cytoses including eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Each is framed by typical timing, dominant mechanisms, key drugs or pathogens, and decision making checkpoints. Five real-world cases illustrate how to differentiate harmless findings from conditions that mandate prompt action, such as drug-induced marrow suppression, cytomegalovirus reactivation, antibiotic-triggered eosinophilia, posttransplant erythrocytosis, and thrombotic microangiopathy. Adopting this problem-oriented approach can reduce unnecessary drug interruptions, target hematology referrals, and preserve both patient safety and allograft longevity.

### How to approach neutropenia [^116gj9Ri]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is defined as the reduction in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/μL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Possible association of 16p11.2 copy number variation with altered lymphocyte and neutrophil counts [^115V1fnB]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated leukocyte differential counts and disease, particularly lymphopenia and neutropenia, in 16p11.2 CNV carriers as some genes mapped to the rearranged region have known roles in leukocyte biology. Lymphopenia is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count < 1.5 × 10⁹/L in adults and < 2.0 × 10⁹/L in children. Neutropenia is defined by a decrease in the number of neutrophilic granulocytes circulating in the blood and may be mild (count between 1.0 and 1.5 × 10⁹/L), moderate (count between 0.5 and 1.0 × 10⁹/L), or severe (count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L). Among white British control individuals from UKB, 0.35% (1163/335789) have a neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10⁹ cells/L of blood and 1% (3221/335789) received a diagnosis of neutropenia, similar to the prevalence of 0.5% previously reported for adult white individuals. Congenital neutropenia, i.e. chronic neutropenia caused by a constitutional genetic defect, is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease with a prevalence of ~1/100,000 people. Whereas mutations in 24 different genes were shown to be associated following a dominant, recessive, or X-linked inheritance pattern, more genes need to be identified as the genetic origin remains unknown in 30% of congenital neutropenia cases.

### Understanding neutropenia secondary to intrinsic or iatrogenic immune dysregulation [^1173fsN6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

As a key member of the innate and adaptive immune response, neutrophils provide insights into the hematopoietic and inflammatory manifestations of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the consequences of immunotherapy. The facile recognition of IEI presenting with neutropenia provides an avenue for hematologists to facilitate early diagnosis and expedite biologically rationale care. Moreover, enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving neutropenia in IEI-decreased bone marrow reserves, diminished egress from the bone marrow, and decreased survival-offers an opportunity to further dissect the pathophysiology driving neutropenia secondary to iatrogenic immune dysregulation, eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

### Germline LCP1 mutations cause immunodeficiency with neutropenia, monocytopenia, lymphopenia and defective cytokinesis [^113VTeLx]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by neutropenia, recurrent infections and an increased leukemia risk. Multiple genetic defects underlying SCN have been identified, but a genetic diagnosis is still lacking in a significant proportion of patients. Here, we report four independent pedigrees with heterozygous variants in LCP1. Variants c.740–1G > T and c.740–20_744del resulted in the same alternatively spliced RNA product, causing an in-frame deletion (p. A247_E254del). Variant c.509C > T in the third pedigree resulted in p.S170L, and variant c.806T > C in the fourth pedigree in p.L269P. Affected individuals suffer from neutropenia, poor or complete lack of response to G-CSF treatment, and variable degrees of lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and monocytopenia. Patients with A247_E254del and p.L269P presented with tetraploid cells in the bone marrow, indicative of disturbed cytokinesis. In one of these kindreds, two individuals developed acute leukemia. G-CSF non-responsiveness and defective cell cycling were repaired upon correction of the LCP1 A247_E254del variant in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, supporting the monogenic origin of the disease. Indicative of their gain-of-function, both A247_E254del and S170L variants increased F-actin bundling and formation of abnormal protrusions. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of A247_E254del bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed deregulation of signaling pathways controlling mitosis in multi-lineage and lymphoid-primed HSPC subsets. We conclude that activating LCP1 variants cause a new hematopoietic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Depending on the consequences of the LCP1 variants for protein structure, patients may suffer from G-CSF refractory severe neutropenia, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, monocytopenia, and defective cytokinesis.

### Chlorambucil (Leukeran) [^1114rEn3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Many patients develop a slowly progressive lymphopenia during treatment. The lymphocyte count usually rapidly returns to normal levels upon completion of drug therapy. Most patients have some neutropenia after the third week of treatment and this may continue for up to 10 days after the last dose. Subsequently, the neutrophil count usually rapidly returns to normal. Severe neutropenia appears to be related to dosage and usually occurs only in patients who have received a total dosage of 6.5 mg/kg or more in one course of therapy with continuous dosing. About one quarter of all patients receiving the continuous-dose schedule, and one third of those receiving this dosage in 8 weeks or less may be expected to develop severe neutropenia.

While it is not necessary to discontinue chlorambucil at the first evidence of a fall in neutrophil count, it must be remembered that the fall may continue for 10 days after the last dose, and that as the total dose approaches 6.5 mg/kg, there is a risk of causing irreversible bone marrow damage. The dose of chlorambucil should be decreased if leukocyte or platelet counts fall below normal values and should be discontinued for more severe depression.

Chlorambucil should not be given at full dosages before 4 weeks after a full course of radiation therapy or chemotherapy because of the vulnerability of the bone marrow to damage under these conditions. If the pretherapy leukocyte or platelet counts are depressed from bone marrow disease process prior to institution of therapy, the treatment should be instituted at a reduced dosage.

Persistently low neutrophil and platelet counts or peripheral lymphocytosis suggest bone marrow infiltration. If confirmed by bone marrow examination, the daily dosage of chlorambucil should not exceed 0.1 mg/kg. Chlorambucil appears to be relatively free from gastrointestinal side effects or other evidence of toxicity apart from the bone marrow depressant action. In humans, single oral doses of 20 mg or more may produce nausea and vomiting.

Children with nephrotic syndrome and patients receiving high pulse doses of chlorambucil may have an increased risk of seizures. As with any potentially epileptogenic drug, caution should be exercised when administering chlorambucil to patients with a history of seizure disorder or head trauma, or who are receiving other potentially epileptogenic drugs.

Administration of live vaccines to immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

### Risk of common infections in people with inflammatory bowel disease in primary care: a population-based cohort study [^1177aJ6g]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

We did not show an association between mild lymphopenia or neutropenia and increased infection risk in IBD, an interesting finding that warrants further study. The finding that lower lymphocyte counts were associated with a decreased chance of infection in CD might correlate with thiopurine use and consequent lower disease activity. Similarly, a retrospective observational study from Germany found no association between mild lymphopenia and opportunistic infections, while Toruner et al found thiopurine-induced lymphopenia or neutropenia in IBD did not increase opportunistic infections. These findings suggest that either IBD itself or the drugs used to treat it result in, or are associated with, immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation that influences infection risk independent of either neutropenia or lymphopenia. Recent studies have indicated that innate lymphoid cells play a key role in mucosal inflammation and immunity against bacterial, viral and parasitic infection, and that an imbalanced accumulation in the population of Th1, Th2, Th17 and natural killer cells not only perpetuates chronic inflammation but also causes a dysfunctional immune response to infection in IBD. It is also likely that additional inhibition of innate and adaptive immunity by drugs used to treat IBD could exacerbate immune and/or cytokine imbalance, contributing to the observed infection risk.

### Baseline and early lymphopenia predict for the risk of febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy [^115ecw18]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

To address this issue, a risk model for FN based on day 1 lymphocyte count was delineated in a large series of 950 patients (CLB-1996). The prognostic value of the two risk models for febrile neutropenia, relying respectively on day 1 and day 5 haematological parameters, was then tested and compared in two validation series.

### Case report: a fatal case of latent melioidosis activated by COVID-19 [^115QgGC2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Serial outpatient laboratory results within the 3 years before the patient's presentation showed a stable absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, and CD4+T cell count until his admission, when he had a notable decrease in all three, thereby making him prone to acute decompensation from latent melioidosis activation. The patient's newly compromised innate and cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by these changes in the blood counts on the date of his admission, was likely a result of COVID-19, as evidenced by his exposure risk and published findings of the association of lymphopenia and neutropenia with COVID-19. He may have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus from contact with customers after stores in South Jersey reopened in June 2020, correlating with the onset of his respiratory and systemic symptoms, characteristic of COVID-19. On the date of his admission, the Atlantic COVID Tracking Project reported 180,265 positive cases in New Jersey, supporting his high risk of exposure during widespread community transmission. Early during the COVID-19 pandemic, reviews of laboratory abnormalities in hospitalized patients showed that lymphopenia was present on admission in 83.2% of 1,099 patients and that neutropenia was present in 27% of 734 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes lymphopenia and neutropenia remains unidentified. Proposed mechanisms for lymphopenia include infiltration and destruction of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV-2 as well as sequestration of lymphocytes at affected target organs. As it likely did in our patient, lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients has been shown to increase susceptibility to severe bacterial infections, ARDS, and overall mortality.

### Idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis: possible mechanisms and management [^111wvpNT]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence of drug-induced neutropenia has not changed in the western hemisphere over the last 30 years. Yet, the drug panorama has changed considerably. This implies that host factors may play an intriguing role for this idiosyncratic reaction. The knowledge as to mechanisms for the reaction has advanced with emerging understanding of neutropoiesis and immune regulation. Nonetheless, it is still remarkably difficult to pinpoint why and how a drug causes this unexpected, severe adverse event in a patient. Patient characteristics, e.g. genetics, appear to be keys for better understanding, predictions and prevention. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111cLhuZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^114JDbo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Congenital neutropenia and rare functional phagocyte disorders in children [^1161KPyr]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Both profound neutropenia and functional phagocyte disorders render patients susceptible to recurrent, unusual, and/or life-threatening infections. Many disorders also have nonhematologic manifestations and a substantial risk of leukemogenesis. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and interrogation of the complete blood count with differential/bone marrow examination coupled with immunologic and genetic analyses. Treatment of the quantitative neutrophil disorders depends on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas management of functional phagocyte disease is reliant on antimicrobials and/or targeted therapies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for most disorders but is not used on a routine basis.

### Independent associations of lymphopenia and neutropenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal, multinational study [^114q8NLC]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia had a somewhat different profile of associations, and the relationship between neutropenia and overall disease activity is less clear. Like lymphopenia, after adjustment for confounders, neutropenia was significantly associated with elevated ESR, but not with SLEDAI-2K, IS use, or the modified LLDAS.

Our study was the first to comprehensively examine the different associations of medication use with lymphopenia and neutropenia in SLE. Mechanisms of leucopenia are complex, ranging from a direct or indirect effect on marrow production, ineffective maturation, increased immune-mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis, or increased sequestration. Medications can affect haematological lineages differently, and they can interact with disease effects as well as with other medications.

Prednisolone use had the strongest association with lymphopenia, after adjustment. We also demonstrated that IS use was independently associated with lymphopenia. Of note, AZA, MTX, TAC, CYC and RTX were independently associated with lymphopenia, whereas MMF/MPA was not.

The associations of neutropenia with medication were somewhat surprising. Overall IS, when studied collectively, did not increase the risk of neutropenia. AM, on the other hand, was associated with increased risk of neutropenia, although we had shown that this was mostly when it was used in combination with another IS. These findings may demonstrate a degree of confounding by indication rather than a causal relationship, and we are observing other factors that may influence treatment decision-making of clinicians that may take into account prior experience and disease activity of patients. Our study has shown that among all IS, MTX and CyA use was associated with reduced risk of neutropenia.

These findings are highly relevant to clinicians. Among the IS, the myelosuppressive effect of some are better studied than others; for example, the relationship between deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase and AZA-induced leucopenia, which can be inherited or due to a functional deficiency, is well recognized. When SLE patients treated with drugs such as AZA present with neutropenia, the question of causation by drug vs disease activity is raised. Although caution is needed in ascribing causation based on observational data, our findings do not suggest a significant association between neutropenia and the IS drugs commonly used to treat SLE, suggesting that disease activity is a more likely cause, a finding supported by the association of neutropenia with ESR and negative association with LLDAS attainment.

### Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases? [^114vdC6u]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 resemble sHLH

The cardinal features of sHLH are high fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cytopenia (e.g. anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), coagulopathy, central nervous system disturbances, and rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. Respiratory symptoms, which commonly present as dyspnea and cough, or ARDS can also occur in patients with sHLH. This phenomenon mostly occurs in cases triggered by respiratory viruses, and the signs of infection may overlap with the symptoms of sHLH. Similarly, the majority of patients with COVID-19 present with high fever (observed in 44% of patients upon presentation, and subsequently, in 64.5–99% patients), cough (45–82%), dyspnea (6.5–63.5%), and myalgia or fatigue (11–70%). Some patients also show liver damage (transaminase activity), lymphocytopenia, and rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. Indeed, a number of the cardinal clinical features of these two conditions are shared, as summarized in Table 2.

Hematologic adverse events

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Although rare, hematologic irAEs have been described following ICI treatment and the literature includes case reports of hemolytic anemia, red cell aplasia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia and hemophilia A. An active hematologic irAE also needs to be distinguished from transient changes in laboratory values that can occur during initiation of an immune response. Post treatment lymphcytosis, eosinophilia, neutrophilia and monocytosis can be observed and are not typically clinically significant though some reports suggest they may be prognostic. Persistent post treatment cytopenias or progressive cytopenias should be evaluated for autoimmune causes as well as with a peripheral smear, reticulocyte count and assessment for hemolysis. Causal attribution is complicated by the fact that malignant disease and its complications can also lead to cytopenias. Since the CTCAE definition of thrombocytopenia describes absolute platelet levels rather than an indication of changes in cell number, it is not a reliable tool for evaluating potentially life-threatening ICI-induced thrombocytopenia.

Diagnostic evaluation

Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored at the start of immune therapy, at intervals during treatment, and periodically in long-term survivors who are no longer receiving treatment. Development of anemia should prompt evaluation for common causes such as GI bleeding, cancer-related anemia or cancer progression, or causative drugs, including a work up for hemolysis. If the source of anemia cannot be identified, bone marrow biopsy may be indicated to rule out red cell aplasia. Similarly, any patient who develops thrombocytopenia or neutropenia should be evaluated for potential causes including medication-related cell destruction or disease progression; in cases where an obvious cause cannot be identified, an autoimmune cause should be considered and investigated accordingly.

When to refer

In general, patients with unexplained cytopenias should be referred to hematology for evaluation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children with autoimmune neutropenia may be a cause for concern. In this retrospective study, none of the 24 autoimmune neutropenia cases manifested severe coronavirus disease 2019. We found a significant improvement in neutrophils and a reduction in lymphocytes at post-infection follow-up compared with the median of previous values. We speculate that this paradoxical effect may be due to postinfection immunological phenomena.

While lymphopenia has been a common finding in COVID-19 infection, particularly in severe cases, febrile neutropenia has been very rarely reported in immunocompetent patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a 76-year-old hypertensive and diabetic man who was hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infection and developed delayed-onset severe neutropenia with neutropenic fever, which responded to treatment with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This case highlights the importance of identifying a rare complication (febrile neutropenia on the fifth week) of COVID-19 infection in hospitalised patients by intensive monitoring and aggressive management for favourable outcomes.

The last decade has demonstrated how outwardly similar patients may have substantial underlying biological heterogeneity, even in acute illness syndromes such as SARS-CoV-2. Identifying biological subphenotypes of acute illness and understanding how those differences may inform selection of different therapies are key precision medicine research priorities in critical care. Although Michels and colleagues raise more questions than answers, this excellent study demonstrates how a precision medicine framework integrating clinical observations, molecular assays, and advanced data analyses can bring new insights into the immunology of severe infection.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of neutropenia discovered in routine complete blood cell counts: a longitudinal study [^112LhQYU]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Neutropenia, defined as an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.5 G L(-1), may accompany a variety of diseases. However, the clinical significance of neutropenia detected in a routine complete blood cell count is poorly understood.

Methods

Using a primary care resource, comprising more than 370 000 individuals, we assessed the association with a number of previously recognized conditions as well as all-cause mortality in the 4 years following the identification of neutropenia. By matching laboratory data with Danish nationwide health registers, risk estimates were assessed.

Results

Neutropenia was observed in approximately 1% of all individuals and was associated dose dependently with viral infections, haematological malignancies (but not autoimmune disorders or solid cancers) and mortality. Neutropenia was particularly associated with HIV, acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Odds ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for viral infections were 2.32 (1.84–2.91), 2.80 (2.20–3.57) and 4.77 (3.22–7.07) for subnormal (≥ 1.5–1.8 G L(-1)), mild (≥ 1.0–1.5 G L(-1)) and moderate-severe (≥ 0.0–1.0 G L(-1)) neutropenic individuals, respectively (all P < 0.001). Likewise, odds ratios (95% CI) for haematological malignancies were 3.23 (2.35–4.45), 8.69 (6.58–11.47) and 46.03 (33.98–62.35), for the same neutropenia levels, respectively (all P < 0.001). Thus, the lower the ANC, the greater the likelihood of these diseases. The relative risk estimates observed for severe neutropenia corresponded to absolute risks of haematological malignancies and mortality from any cause of 40% and > 50%, respectively.

Conclusions

Neutropenia is an ominous sign necessitating careful follow-up. The risk estimates presented here support focusing attention to viral diseases and haematological malignancies when neutropenia is observed.

Summary

Mild neutropenia is a common finding in SLE that requires no specific therapy. Whether or not this leads to immune suppression is not known. However, a small percentage of patients with SLE develop severe, even life-threatening, neutropenia, which may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, both T cell and B cell mediated. The patient with severe neutropenia with opportunistic infection or the risk of such infection can be successfully treated with G-CSF.

Results

Patient characteristics

Data from 2330 patients and 18 287 visits from the APLC 2013–18 dataset were analysed, restricting the analysis to patients with ≥ 2 visits and with per-visit data on peripheral blood white blood cell counts available. Patients were followed-up for a median (IQR) (range) of 840 (378, 1281) (21, 1765) days.

Frequency of leucopenia

Figure 1 summarizes the frequency and proportion [n (%)] of visits with different grades of leukopenia. In total, 1018 patients (43.7%) experienced leucopenia of at least grade 2, in 3590 (19.6%) visits. Of the patients who experienced leucopenia, ∼66% (n = 676) had leucopenia in two or more visits [median (IQR) (range) number of leucopenia visits = 2 (1, 5) (1, 21)]. A total of 867 (37.2%) patients experienced lymphopenia in 3065 (16.8%) visits and 292 (12.5%) patients experienced neutropenia in 622 (3.4%) visits; ∼61% (618/1018) of leucopenic patients experienced lymphopenia only, while a further 24.5% (n = 249) experienced lymphopenia in combination with either neutropenia or low total WCC or both. In contrast, visits affected by neutropenia were less common and were frequently associated with a corresponding drop in total white cell count and/or lymphopenia (Fig. 1). Overall, 7.3% (n = 74) of leucopenic patients had neutropenia only, and another 21.4% (n = 218) had neutropenia with lymphopenia and/or low WCC. 1

### T-cell large granular leukemia and related proliferations [^117N6nVj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Session 9 of the 2005 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop focused on large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemias and related disorders. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemias, discussed herein, account for 2% to 3% of cases of small lymphocytic leukemia. T-LGL diseases cover a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that include reactive conditions, typically associated with autoimmune disease, to outright leukemia. These disorders are found in older people, with an average age at initial examination of approximately 60 years and a median survival of more than 10 years in T-LGL leukemia. Systemic symptoms and neutropenia are common at initial examination. Lymphocytosis, composed of small mature lymphocytes with increased cytoplasm, is common. The spleen and bone marrow are involved in T-LGL leukemia, although morphologic findings may be subtle. The immunophenotype is typically that of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Some cases may be due to chronic immune stimulation, with subsequent clonal escape and proliferation of a neoplastic population of lymphocytes.

Question 2: What is the leading cause of death in patients affected with this disease?
A. Hematological malignancy
B. Severe bacterial and/or viral complications
C. Solid organ malignancy
D. Vascular thrombosis
E. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

Answers:

A. Hematological malignancy – Correct. By age 40, more than 80% of the patients present with a hematologic malignancy. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia are the leading causes of death in patients with GATA2 deficiency.
B. Severe bacterial and/or viral complications – Incorrect. Severe viral and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are the most common presenting symptoms, affecting 60% of the patients at presentation. The complications from these infections are the second most common cause of death in the affected patients.
C. Solid organ malignancy – Incorrect. Solid organ malignancies, especially HPV-related, affects 20%-35% of the patients with GATA2 deficiency. Their high frequency is hypothesized to be due to delayed viral clearance and impaired immunosurveillance mechanisms. However, they result in lower mortality rates than the hematological malignancies and infectious complications.
D. Vascular thrombosis – Incorrect. GATA2 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. Although thromboembolic phenomena are reported in up to 25% of the patients, they are not the leading cause of death.
E. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis – Incorrect. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis affects 18% of the patients. Their increased incidence is possibly due to an impaired GATA2-mediated surfactant metabolism and excretion by lung macrophages. However, it is not the leading cause of death in patients with GATA2 deficiency.

G-CSF treatment, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts

Because the patients had ANCs < 0.5 × 10⁹/L and many had recurrent fevers and infections, most were treated with G-CSF for very long periods. Interruptions in G-CSF treatment predictably led to reversion of the ANC to its baseline for most patients and recurrence of the same symptoms and problems that led to treatment. The median ANCs with ranges at the time of enrollment in the SCNIR for each group, pediatric and adult, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The high counts that extend the ranges probably reflected severe infections. G-CSF median treatment doses and responses are also presented in Tables 2 and 3. For patients on alternate-day or other than daily treatment, the doses were the calculated median daily dose.

Table 3.
ANC * and ALC † before and on G-CSF treatment

Many patients came to the SCNIR with histories of treatment with diverse therapies, particularly in the early years of SCNIR, including prophylactic antibiotics and glucocorticosteroids. It is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies and their combinations, but it appears that they offered little benefit and possible risks to these patients.

Table 3 shows ANC and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) values for each patient category. Notably, the congenital group had the lowest pre-G-CSF neutrophil counts, and this difference was statistically significant compared with all groups (ANOVA, P = 0.006). The mean G-CSF dose was highest in the congenital group, though this was only statistically significant compared with the cyclic and autoimmune/idiopathic groups (ANOVA; P < .0001). On G-CSF, the mean and median ANC increased in all groups.

Lymphocyte counts were generally within normal limits, but adult patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia had lower ALCs than the other patient groups (t test; P < .0001). For patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia in SCNIR, none of the patients who developed a lymphoproliferative disorder had lymphocytosis or a diagnosis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia at enrollment.

As previously reported, patients with congenital neutropenia often have moderate thrombocytosis, which reverts to normal on G-CSF. In many cases, the mild anemia associated with severe chronic neutropenia reverted toward normal if infections and chronic inflammation resolve.

### Understanding chronic neutropenia: life is short [^111z3tgT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic neutropenia are extensive, varying from haematopoietic stem cell disorders resulting in defective neutrophil production, to accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil progenitors or circulating mature neutrophils. While the knowledge concerning genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia or bone marrow failure is increasing rapidly, the functional role and consequences of these genetic alterations is often not well understood. In addition, there is a large group of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and metabolic diseases, in which chronic neutropenia is one of the symptoms, while there is no clear bone marrow pathology or haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Altogether, these disease entities illustrate the complexity of normal neutrophil development, the functional role of the (bone marrow) microenvironment and the increased propensity to undergo apoptosis, which is typical for neutrophils. The large variety of disorders associated with chronic neutropenia makes classification almost impossible and possibly not desirable, based on the clinical phenotypes. However, a better understanding of the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation and neutrophil development is of great importance in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained chronic neutropenia. In this review we propose insights in the pathophysiology of chronic neutropenia in the context of the functional role of key players during normal neutrophil development, neutrophil release and neutrophil survival.

### Congenital neutropenia syndromes [^1167cm79]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia syndromes comprise a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders. Hereditary conditions associated with low neutrophil counts are persistent and need to be differentiated from neutropenia secondary to autoimmune processes or other pathologic conditions, such as myelodysplasia or leukemia. Clinically, congenital neutropenia is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections. Recently, several novel genetic defects were described in patients with congenital neutropenia, shedding light on the pathophysiology of these rare diseases.

### Factors influencing viral shedding time in non-severe paediatric infection with the SARS-CoV-2: a single-centre retrospective study [^1126XPJp]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Laboratory findings

The relationship between peripheral blood cell counts and the severity of COVID-19 has been previously identified. A recent paediatric COVID-19 meta-analysis revealed that lymphopenia and leucopenia were the most common white cell abnormalities. A Chinese study involving 1099 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed that lymphopenia was present in 83.2%, thrombocytopenia in 36.2% and leucopenia in 33.7% of the patients. In our study, lymphopenia accounted for 66.7% of the cases, leucopenia for 40%, neutropenia for 27.1%. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are both associated with immune state, which may have relationship with viral clearance. A prospective study showed that SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with lymphopenia had longer viral RNA clearance durations, compared with non-lymphopenia patients with COVID-19. The cause of lymphopenia during SARS-CoV-2 infection is not very clear. One hypothesis is that lymphocytes express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which is directly attacked and depleted by the virus. Another theory is that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumour necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐6 in patients with COVID-19 promote lymphocyte-induced apoptosis. Lymphocytes play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and orchestrating the inflammatory response to protect the body from viral infection. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the depletion of CD4 + but not CD8 + T cells resulted in immune-mediated enhanced interstitial pneumonia and the delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs. In our study, we also found that children with lymphopenia had longer VSTs. Meanwhile, laboratory testing of samples from a large number of patients with COVID-19 has revealed the widespread incidence of leucopenia within this group. Furthermore, leucopenia was found to be a significant mortality indicator among patients with COVID-19. However, no study has previously outlined the relationship between leucopenia and VST. In our study, leucopenia was independently associated with VST, as children with leucopenia had longer VSTs. Transient neutropenia is common in paediatric practice and often occurs in connection with viral infections. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defence against the invasion of foreign pathogens. Neutrophils are an important component of the innate immune response. Viral infection caused inflammation and immunosuppression in the bone marrow, which can lead to neutropenia. Neutropenia can be seen in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, the rate of neutropenia among SARS-CoV-2-infected children was 23%. A study of neutropenia in mild paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that neutropenia was not a negative prognostic factor in paediatric COVID-19. However, in a case report of a child with congenital neutropenia, the viral clearance time was 35 days, considerably longer than that of immunocompetent children, for whom the median VST was 13 days. In our study, neutropenic individuals had longer VSTs and its influence on COVID-19 severity needs to be further elucidated.

Laboratory and clinical features associated with neutropaenic episodes

At the time of the neutropaenic episode (n = 77), coexistent leucopaenia was found in 48 (62.3%), lymphopaenia in 8 (10.4%), thrombocytopaenia in 1 (1.3%) and anaemia in 21 (27.3%). None of the patients had lymphocytosis (lymphocytes > 4.0×10⁹/L). At the time of neutropaenia, most patients were in remission (47.4%, DAS28 < 2.6) or had low disease activity (18.6%, DAS28 < 3.2), while only a few had moderate (22.4%, DAS28 > 3.2 and ≤ 5.1) or high (10.2%, DAS28 > 5.1) disease activity.

### Lymphocytosis and lymphopenia induced by imported infectious diseases: a controlled cross-sectional study of 17, 229 diseased German travelers returning from the tropics and subtropics [^11357oPF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

The present controlled cross-sectional study aimed to assess relative and absolute lymphocytosis and lymphopenia induced by imported infectious diseases (IDs) seen among patients consulting the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical Center of the University of Munich (1999–2014) after being in the tropics and subtropics. The analysis investigated data sets from 17,229 diseased German travelers returning from Latin America (3,238), Africa (5,467), and Asia (8,524), and from 1,774 healthy controls who had not recently traveled. Among the cases, the proportion of those with relative lymphopenia (10.5%) and absolute lymphopenia (8.0%) was significantly higher than among controls (3.2% and 3.6%, respectively), whereas relative lymphocytosis was significantly lower among cases (6.1%) than among controls (8.0%). The study identified IDs with significantly larger proportions of relative lymphocytosis (cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection [56%], infectious mononucleosis [51%], and dengue fever [11%]); absolute lymphocytosis (infectious mononucleosis [70%] and CMV infection [63%]); relative lymphopenia (streptococcal pharyngitis [56%], malaria [34%], Campylobacter infection [19%], salmonellosis [18%], and shigellosis [17%]); and of absolute lymphopenia (human immunodeficiency virus infection [53%], malaria [45%], dengue fever [40%], salmonellosis [16%], and Campylobacter infection [11%]). This study demonstrates that relative and absolute lymphocytosis and lymphopenia are useful laboratory findings for travelers returning from the tropics and subtropics, as they are typically caused by imported viral, bacterial, and protozoan IDs.

### Late-onset and long-lasting autoimmune neutropenia: an analysis from the Italian neutropenia registry [^1165JtkR]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary autoimmune neutropenia (pAN) is typified by onset in early infancy and a mild/moderate phenotype that resolves within 3 years of diagnosis. In contrast, secondary AN is classically an adult disease associated with malignancy, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, viral infection, or drugs. This study describes a cohort of 79 children from the Italian Registry who, although resembling pAN, did not fully match the criteria for pAN because neutropenia either appeared after age 5 years (LO-Np) or lasted longer than 3 years (LL-Np). These 2 categories compared with classical pAN showed a far inferior rate of resolution (P < .001), lower severity of neutropenia (P = 0.03), leukopenia (P < .001), lymphopenia (P < .001) with low B+ (P = 0.001), increased need of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (P = 0.04), and increased frequency of autoimmunity over the disease course (P < .001). A paired comparison between LO-Np and LL-Np suggested that LO-Np had a lower rate of resolution (P < .001) and lower white blood cell (P < .001) and lymphocyte (P < .001) values, higher occurrence of apthae (P = 0.008), and a stronger association with autoimmune diseases/markers (P = 0.001) than LL-Np, thus suggesting a more pronounced autoimmune signature for LO-Np. A next-generation sequencing panel applied in a small subgroup of LO-Np and LL-Np patients identified variants related to immune dysregulations. Overall, these findings indicate that there are important differences among pAN LL-Np and LO-Np. Forms rising after 3 years of age, with low tendency to resolution, require tight monitoring and extensive immune investigations aimed to early identify underlying immunologic disease.

### The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis [^111CCmwR]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic, with more than 84 million cases and over 1 million deaths reported in the United States (US). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are at particularly high risk for developing the severe disease when infected by SARS-CoV-2. This increased risk is thought to be secondary to a dysregulated immune system inherently associated with CLL, in addition to CLL treatments that can further exacerbate immunosuppression and blunt response to vaccination. In two large retrospective series of CLL patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the case fatality rate was 35%; patients with previously untreated CLL and those on active treatment had similar outcomes. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor condition to CLL, is defined as an absolute clonal B cell count of < 5 × 10⁹/L, in the absence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cytopenias. MBL is one of the most common pre-malignant conditions in humans, affecting approximately 5–10% of adults over the age of 40 years. MBL can be further subdivided into low-count MBL (typically identified through screening and defined by an absolute B-cell count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and high-count MBL with absolute B cell count 0.5–4.9 × 10⁹/L (typically identified in the clinic). Recent data indicate that both low- and high-count MBL are at high risk of developing serious infections requiring hospitalization relative to healthy individuals without MBL, suggesting that immune dysfunction in CLL develops early during B cell leukemogenesis. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the risk of COVID-19 infection in MBL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Selection criteria for patients

Selection criteria for patients in all series were identical and as follows: age above 17 years, negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology in patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chemotherapy regimens administered sequentially, that is every 8 or more days. All patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy were included, regardless of the number of previous courses. Exclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of low-grade lymphoma or leukaemia because of the possible contamination of peripheral blood by malignant lymphocytes, administration of cytokines or granulocyte growth factors during or after chemotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy regimen requiring bone marrow or peripheral-blood stem-cell reinjection. Information about histology, primary tumour site, chemotherapy regimen, sex, age, PS, blood cell count on day 1 (d1) just before the administration of chemotherapy and on day 5, and FN following the studied chemotherapy course were collected. In the CLB-1996 series, the history of FN was not available for the majority of the patients, and therefore not collected. This information is available for the Elypse 1 series only. Each patient was analysed for only one course of chemotherapy. No prophylactic antibiotics were used in any series. Patients' characteristics are indicated in Table 1

Description of the patients

CLB-1996 series

This series is the exhaustive cohort of patients treated with conventional chemotherapy regimens in the Department of Medicine of the Centre Léon Bérard in 1996 who matched the selection criteria (Table 1). There were 3223 chemotherapy courses given to 1116 patients. Patients previously treated outside the centre were eligible. Patients with a missing blood cell count at day 1 (n = 65) and receiving G-CSF or GM-CSF (n = 101) after the course were excluded. Therefore, 950 of the 1116 patients (85%) were eligible and analysed.

Elypse 1 series

The prospective cohort (Elypse 1) is a multicentric prospective series of 321 patients treated with conventional chemotherapy in both general community hospital (n = 13) and regional cancer centres (n = 5): 84 patients (26%) were treated in cancer centres and 237 (74%) in general community hospitals (Table 1). Every participating physician had to include all his consecutive patients during 1 month (chosen by local investigators for each institution) between November 1995 and September 1996. Each patient was followed for two consecutive courses of chemotherapy.

5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities

Neutropenia

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm³).

Evaluate neutrophil counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation and interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e. ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lymphopenia

ALC less than 500 cells/mm³were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate lymphocyte counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Anemia

Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate hemoglobin at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 8 g/dL) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lipids

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and thereafter according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations compared to treatment with placebo.

Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1117VWXr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Lymphopenia — workup and management for patients on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy include structured evaluation and targeted prophylaxis. Workup should include history with special attention to nutritional status and exposures to lymphocyte depleting therapy, physical examination with special attention to spleen size, complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, chest X‑ray to evaluate for thymoma, and assessment for infections including bacterial, fungal, and viral causes (specifically CMV or HIV). Management states that no specific action is required for lymphopenia G1–G3 and ICPI therapy should be continued; for G4, continue ICPI therapy and initiate Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with CMV screening, perform HIV or hepatitis screening if not already done, and consider EBV testing if there is evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatitis, fevers, and hemolysis concerning for lymphoproliferative disease.

### Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia [^113zzsx5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A novel coronaravirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread throughout the world in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many discoveries and clinical manifestations. A young patient is presented with new, self-resolving neutropenia presenting weeks after a prolonged hospital stay for COVID-19 pneumonia. Workup included analysis for underlying infection, nutritional abnormalities, malignancy, medication and toxin exposure, all of which were negative. From 2020 to the present, few reports have described neutropenia associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. In particular, no reports have described a delayed presentation of neutropenia. The authors would like to propose that the significant inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 is likely what led to this patient's postviral neutropenia. Furthermore, in young healthy patients, bone marrow biopsy may be deferred and a watchful-waiting approach may be taken to assess for neutropenia resolution.

### Isolated neutropenia as a rare but serious adverse event secondary to immune checkpoint inhibition [^112YiTwo]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With rapid advances in the field of immuno-oncology and frequent use of newer ICI for multiple indications, we speculate that the potential for encountering unique irAEs secondary to ICI will rise. Our case adds to the growing body of evidence alluding to the unique immune adverse effect profiles of ICI. Evidence from our review establishes that ICI related neutropenia, although rare, tends to be severe, with a majority being grade-4. These immune-mediated neutropenias can lead to significant morbidity and mortality arising from infectious complications. Permanent ICI discontinuation needs to be strongly considered in almost all patients. Hence ICI related neutropenia as an irAE requires early identification with prompt interventions using immune suppression and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors to perhaps mitigate duration and thus prevent potentially fatal outcomes.

Anaemia and lymphopenia are associated with an increased risk of infection

Crude rates of infection among individuals with baseline anaemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia were 181.2, 151.8 and 256.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively, compared with 172.0 per 1000 person-years among individuals without haematological abnormality. Baseline anaemia and lymphopenia were associated with an increased risk of infection in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (Table 3). There was no evidence of an association for baseline neutropenia. For a breakdown of infection types see, available at Rheumatology online.

Adjusted HRs of infections by the presence or absence of haematological abnormality at baseline

Incorporating haematological measures throughout follow-up identified many more individuals with at least one test indicating haematological abnormality (anaemia 34% of individuals, neutropenia 4%, lymphopenia 9%) compared with the assessment of baseline haematological measures. The median number of test measures per individual was 6 (interquartile range 2–18). Consistent with the analysis of baseline measures, anaemia and lymphopenia were associated with an increased risk of infection (Table 4).

### Independent associations of lymphopenia and neutropenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal, multinational study [^112xky9B]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Using a large, prospectively followed cohort, we have demonstrated independent, differential associations of lymphopenia and neutropenia in SLE. ESR, serological activity and, in the opposite direction, LLDAS were associated with both lymphopenia and neutropenia in multivariable analysis. While IS medications including AZA, MTX, TAC, CYC and RTX were independently associated with lymphopenia, only LEF and RTX use were associated with neutropenia; MTX and CyA were protective. AM use, particularly in combination with other medications, was associated with neutropenia. In SLE studies, lymphopenia and leucopenia are commonly grouped as leucopenia, including in disease activity measures such as SLEDAI-2K and hence treatment response measures used in clinical trials, such as SRI. Our findings suggest that lymphocyte and neutrophil counts should be recorded separately in the assessment of SLE.

### Risk of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in patients with solid malignant tumors treated with curative intent radiation therapy [^1126y3oz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infections are potentially serious complications of treatment in patients with cancer, which contribute with significant morbidity and mortality. It is well documented that bacterial infections are common among patients with cancer and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy, but there are very few studies on the incidence, cause, and risk factors of infections in patients treated with radiation therapy for solid tumors.

A previous study found that radiation-induced lymphopenia was associated with an increased risk of a composite of infections in the first 3 months after radiation therapy. In the present study, we evaluated incidence of various types of infections, including their presumed cause from the start of radiation therapy until 1 year after radiation therapy, and assessed the association between radiation-induced lymphopenia and risk of infections.

### Transient stress lymphocytosis: an immunophenotypic characterization of the most common cause of newly identified adult lymphocytosis in a tertiary hospital [^113Np2wx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated 52 consecutive cases of newly identified absolute lymphocytosis to determine the hematologic and immunophenotypic features of transient stress lymphocytosis (TSL). The lymphocytosis in all cases was associated with an acute stressful event and ranged from 4,000 to 10,400/microL (4.0–10.4 x 10(9)/L). Compared with healthy individuals, patients with TSL showed an increase in the total WBC, absolute lymphocyte (ALC), absolute neutrophil (ANC), and platelet counts with no difference in hemoglobin levels. Immunophenotypic analyses of 38 cases revealed increases in absolute numbers of T B, and natural killer cells. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased, predominantly accountedfor by an increase in memory cell subsets, with no change in gamma/delta T cells. Follow-up studies showed a significant reduction in the ALC with a concurrent increase in the ANC and reduction in hemoglobin values. The reduction in lymphocytes at resolution was accompanied by reduction in all broad Iymphocyte subsets. However, naive and memory subsets showed different patterns of alteration within the CD4+ and CD8+ populations, suggesting that acute stress differentially affects the in vivo distribution of these subsets.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114cbHm9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma — Observation and testing notes include that 'Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) alone is not an indication for treatment in the absence of leukostasis, which is rarely seen in CLL'. The footnotes specify that 'Platelet counts > 100,000/μL are typically not associated with clinical risk' and that 'Select patients with mild, stable cytopenia (ANC < 1000/μL, Hgb < 11 g/dL, or platelet < 100,000/μL) may continue to be observed'. It also states, 'Other causes of anemia/ thrombocytopenia (eg, autoimmune disorders, vitamin/iron deficiency) should be excluded'. Additionally, 'Outside of clinical trials, CT scans are not required for diagnosis, serial monitoring, surveillance, routine monitoring or treatment response, or progression'.

### Late-onset and long-lasting neutropenias in the young: a new entity anticipating immune-dysregulation disorders [^115sp5qG]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study identifies a new chronic form of immune neutropenia in the young with or without detectable indirect anti-neutrophil antibodies, characterized by mild/moderate neutropenia low risk of severe infection (14%), tendency to develop autoimmune phenomena over the course of the disease (cumulative incidence of 58.6% after 20years of disease duration), leukopenia, progressive reduction of absolute lymphocyte count and a T- and B-cell profile similar to autoimmune disorders like Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (increased HLADR+ and CD3+TCRγδ cells, reduced T regulatory cells, increased double-negative B and a tendency to reduced B memory cells). In a minority of patients, P/LP variants related to primary immuno-regulatory disorders were found. This new form may fit the group of "Likely acquired neutropenia", a provisional category included in the recent International Guidelines on Diagnosis and Management of Neutropenia of EHA and EUNET INNOCHRON ACTION 18233. The early recognition of this form of neutropenia would help clinicians to delineate better specific monitoring plans, genetic counseling, and potentially targeted therapies.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

parameters

In those with cytopenia at presentation (n = 161), 17% (n = 27/161) were pancytopenic, 40% (n = 64/161) anaemic, 8% (n = 13/161) thrombocytopenic, 19% (n = 30/161) neutropenic and 62% (n = 100/161) lymphopenic (Figure 2B). Lowest median haemoglobin was seen in IUIS V and IUIS I, median platelet count was lowest in IUIS II, median lymphocyte count lowest in IUIS I and median neutrophil count lowest in IUIS III (Figure 3, Table S3). IUIS I diagnosis was significantly associated with cytopenia at presentation (OR 12.43, CI 3.82–39.05) namely; severe cytopenia (OR 3.96, CI 1.08–14.88), persistent cytopenia (OR 12.27, CI 3.75–39.95), and unusual cytopenia (OR 8.89, CI 3.04–25.86), namely; anaemia (OR 4.15, CI 1.58–10.90), leucopenia (OR 15.69, CI 1.86–132.29] and lymphopenia (OR 12.16, CI 2.75–53.73), where 52% (11/21) were anaemic, 38% (8/21) leucopenic and 90% lymphopenic (19/21). Cytopenia was associated with IUIS II (OR 5.99, CI 2.80–12.76) seen in 94% (31/33) namely; severe, persistent and/or unusual cytopenia (OR 3.58, CI 1.08–11.97), 3 (1.44–6.24) and 2.71 (1.32–5.60) respectively], 21% (7/33) were thrombocytopenic at presentation with significant association (OR 14.39, CI 2.89–71.57). Neutropenia was seen in 14% with IUIS III showing significant association (OR 3.65, CI 1.44–9.25) [Figure 4, Table S4]. Pancytopenia at presentation was most significantly associated with IUIS I (OR 4.21, CI 1.48–11.99) and a molecular diagnosis (OR 2.81, CI 1.23–6.42). Anaemia was the most prominent cytopenia in IUIS VIb. Class VII did not show marked cytopenia, although lymphocyte count was lower in IUIS VIIa than VIIb (Table S3). The neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with an optimal cut‐off of 1.8, was associated with IUIS I (OR 2.72 CI 1.01–7.28) and molecular diagnosis, cut‐off of 2.1 (OR 2.16, CI 1.19–3.92) with low positive predictive value but high negative predictive value (Table S5).

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^114ZANrB]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Is colony-stimulating therapy needed?

Again, local guidelines should set out the indications for using G-CSF during treatment of neutropenia.

Uncomplicated, short-duration neutropenia should not need routine G-CSF support, even if the patient is febrile. However, many local policies advocate the treatment if the patient is clinically septic and/or hypotensive, expected to have neutropenia of long duration (as with certain chemotherapeutic regimens for haematological diseases), or has organ dysfunction. It is not good practice to wait and see if the patient struggles to recover from the neutropenic event; it is far better to identify those patients at greater risk and intervene early, even given the current absence of randomised data showing that this approach improves survival.

### The contribution of rare copy number variants in FAS toward pathogenesis of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [^115gUegK]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, there are only 4 cases of deletions in FAS that are reported to cause ALPS. A 290-bp deletion resulting in a smaller transcript and addition of a 7 amino-acid peptide extending into the death domain was reported to cause ALPS in an individual with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and neutropenia. A germline 5′ splice-site SNV in the third intron of FAS caused deletion of the entire third exon in an individual presenting with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, elevated interleukin-10, and elevated double-negative T (DNT) cells. Moreover, a paternally inherited germline deletion that included exon 6 of FAS as well as a somatic missense mutation (p. Ala237Pro) located in exon 9 (the death domain) of FAS were reported in an individual with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and the presence of antinuclear antibodies. In the DNT cells, lower FAS expression was reported in this individual relative to his father. Consistent with reduced penetrance observed in ALPS, the father was clinically asymptomatic, but expressed lower FAS than controls by flow cytometric analysis. In addition, a 28-bp deletion c.985_1008+4, encompassing a canonical splice site, was reported to potentially cause haploinsufficiency in an individual with ALPS. This deletion occurred after the death domain and is potentially analogous to a c.987ins20 frameshift variant reported in a patient with undetectable surface expression of FAS. Finally, a loss of function IVS3 as A-G −2 homozygous splice variant that led to skipping of exon 4 and complete lack of FAS receptor expression was reported in a consanguineous patient with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased DNT cells.

The clinical significance of deletions in ALPS undetectable by exome sequencing and their relatively rare occurrence prompt the need for further investigation into the phenotypic spectrum of patients with copy number losses in FAS, as well as the consideration of copy number variant (CNV) testing in the context of ALPS. Here, we describe 3 unrelated families with unique large deletions at the FAS locus underlying ALPS. Two subjects harbored deletions encompassing the entire gene and 1 subject harbored a deletion that encompassed exons 7 through 9. This case series presents additional clinical data and showcases the importance of CNV analyses when there is significant clinical and biomarker evidence consistent with ALPS in the absence of somatic or germline FAS variants.

### Outcomes for patients with severe chronic neutropenia treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^111M2ioh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

We recognize the limitation of this study, including the incomplete definition of the immunological status of patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia, lack of genetic analyses for all patients, and lack of standardization of the timing and reading of BM examinations. We have observed that over time BM examinations have become less frequent in the United States, probably driven by patient preference and costs. We believe that more support is needed for genetic analyses and interpretations. Nevertheless, the SCNIR has demonstrated the value of a registry to collect and longitudinally analyze data to describe clinical outcomes for patients with rare diseases causing severe chronic neutropenia.

### Diagnostic criteria for autoimmune neutropenia [^112cu6ns]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune neutropenia denotes that the number of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils is below 1.5×10⁹/L. This encompasses a wide range of disorders from primary conditions to complications of systemic autoimmune diseases or hematological neoplasms. Antineutrophil autoantibodies are particularly difficult to detect, and their amount does not correlate with the degree of neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the first-line therapy, but should be restricted to patients with total absence of neutrophils and/or severe infections.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^111Q3G1C]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Causal association

This umbrella review does not address causality directly and cannot determine whether the association between neutrophils and poor prognosis in cancer is causal or due to confounding or reverse causation. Previous studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of neutrophils in both tumour progression and suppression. Our study suggests that the overall effect of high NLR could be tumourigenic in certain cases, but further work is required to assess this.

Our study supports the relationship between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer in terms of effect size and consistency of findings. We cannot address temporality as the studies included measured biomarkers before the initiation of treatment but after diagnosis. The biological mechanisms behind inflammation and cancer progression could suggest temporality, as elevated NLR and TAN are proposed to promote increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and risk of metastasis as contributors to poor prognosis.

Clinical significance and future research

Future research should focus on strengthening the current evidence base for specific cancers which displayed suggestive and highly suggestive associations, addressing heterogeneity and small-study issues. Unveiling a causal association between neutrophils and cancer outcomes could lead to cancer treatments which involve neutrophils as a therapeutic target and validate the NLR as a prognostic biomarker in cancer. A causal association between neutrophils and poor prognosis could give further insight into experimental therapy which lowers neutrophil counts in the body to improve outcomes in cancer. Sub-group analysis suggested that the magnitude and direction of effect of NLR on cancer outcomes was robust to adjustment for additional prognostic factors. Regardless, consensus on a minimum set of covariates to adjust for is needed. Furthermore, the dose response relationship between NLR and prognosis remains unclear. Within the included papers, only two of the 86 conducted a dose response analysis. Future work should consider whether the association is linear or has threshold effects. In light of the variation observed in meta-regressions of NLR cut-off and effect size, identification of a clinically relevant NLR cut-off could be specific to different cancer sites and may be affected by treatment. Future systematic reviews should consider performing individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses to allow for the assessment of NLR values on a continuous scale.

### How I manage inpatient consultations for quantitative neutrophil abnormalities in adults [^115NMcU8]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutrophilia and neutropenia commonly lead to inpatient hematology consultation. Quantitative neutrophil abnormalities have a broad differential and include diagnoses that are important to recognize because they may be associated with increased mortality. Neutrophilia can reflect etiologies such as infection, medications, inflammation, splenectomy, and congenital disorders. Neutropenia can arise from infection, medications, autoimmune destruction, sequestration, nutritional deficiency, malignancy, and congenital neutropenia syndromes. In the evaluation of all abnormalities of neutrophil number, the timing of the change, and the patient's historical neutrophil count are crucial.

### Lessons from congenital neutropenia: 50 years of progress in understanding myelopoiesis [^116mao4L]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) was first described just over 50 years ago. The progress in elucidating the clinical features and molecular pathophysiology of SCN closely parallels the progressive growth in our understanding of myelopoiesis. In this historical review, I have delineated this parallel progression in our understanding of the processes of granulocyte differentiation and the pathogenesis of congenital neutropenia. SCN is a heterogeneous disease that can serve as a model for the failure of myelopoiesis, and dissection of its pathogenesis has yielded important insights into the normal process of myeloid development.

### Severe congenital neutropenia [^111fH5k6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia (CN) is a genetically heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a maturation arrest of myelopoiesis at the level of the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 × 10⁹/L. From early infancy patients who have CN suffer from bacterial infections. Leukemias occur in both the autosomal dominant and recessive subtypes of CN. The individual risk for each genetic subtype needs to be evaluated further, because the number of patients tested for the underlying genetic defect is still limited. Acquired G-CSFR (CSF3R) mutations are detected in approximately 80% of patients who had CN and who developed acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that these mutations are involved in leukemogenesis.

### Discerning clinicopathological features of congenital neutropenia syndromes: an approach to diagnostically challenging differential diagnoses [^116Jmxmd]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The congenital neutropenia syndromes are rare haematological conditions defined by impaired myeloid precursor differentiation or function. Patients are prone to severe infections with high mortality rates in early life. While some patients benefit from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, they may still face an increased risk of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for improved outcomes; however, diagnosis depends on familiarity with a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that remain incompletely characterised. The clinical and pathological overlap between reactive conditions, primary and congenital neutropenias, bone marrow failure, and myelodysplastic syndromes further clouds diagnostic clarity. We review the diagnostically useful clinicopathological and morphological features of reactive causes of neutropenia and the most common primary neutropenia disorders: constitutional/benign ethnic neutropenia, chronic idiopathic neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (due to mutations in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, VPS45, JAGN1, CSF3R, SRP54, CLPB and WAS), GATA2 deficiency, Warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, infections and myelokathexis syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, the lysosomal storage disorders with neutropenia: Chediak-Higashi, Hermansky-Pudlak, and Griscelli syndromes, Cohen, and Barth syndromes. We also detail characteristic cytogenetic and molecular factors at diagnosis and in progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia.

### How I treat warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome [^114CHrjr]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by neutropenia, lymphopenia, susceptibility to infections, and myelokathexis, which describes degenerative changes of mature neutrophils and hyperplasia of bone marrow myeloid cells. Some patients present with hypogammaglobulinemia and/or refractory warts of skin and genitalia. Congenital cardiac defects constitute uncommon manifestations of the disease. The disorder, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is caused by heterozygous mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. These mutations lead to an increased sensitivity of neutrophils and lymphocytes to the unique ligand CXCL12 and to an increased accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. Despite greatly improved knowledge of the disease, therapeutic choices are insufficient to prevent some of the disease outcomes, such as development of bronchiectasis, anogenital dysplasia, or invasive cancer. The available therapeutic measures aimed at preventing the risk for infection in WHIM patients are discussed. We critically evaluate the diagnostic criteria of WHIM syndrome, particularly when WHIM syndrome should be suspected in patients with congenital neutropenia and lymphopenia despite the absence of hypogammaglobulinemia and/or warts. Finally, we discuss recent results of trials evaluating plerixafor, a selective antagonist of CXCR4, as a mechanism-oriented strategy for treatment of WHIM patients.

### How I treat autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [^117DaLrz]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) represents a failure of apoptotic mechanisms to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis, permitting accumulation of lymphoid mass and persistence of autoreactive cells that often manifest in childhood with chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurring multilineage cytopenias. Cytopenias in these patients can be the result of splenic sequestration as well as autoimmune complications manifesting as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune neutropenia. More than 300 families with hereditary ALPS have now been described; nearly 500 patients from these families have been studied and followed worldwide over the last 20 years by our colleagues and ourselves. Some of these patients with FAS mutations affecting the intracellular portion of the FAS protein also have an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. The best approaches to diagnosis, follow-up, and management of ALPS, its associated cytopenias, and other complications resulting from infiltrative lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity are presented.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^116AwNWk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Some laboratory abnormalities in patients with vasculitis significantly raise our suspicion for underlying hematologic malignancy and lead us to initiate hematology consultation or referral (Figure 2). Inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis often cause anemia, neutrophil‐dominant leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. In contrast, erythrocytosis, neutropenia, persistent monocytosis or lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and especially bicytopenia or pancytopenia are uncommon and merit further evaluation. Eosinophilia is commonly recognized by rheumatologists and has its own broad differential diagnosis, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, IgG4‐related disease, and hematologic mimics (Table 1), as has previously been described. In the absence of lymphocytosis, elevated SPEP and SFLC are more likely to reveal monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) than plasma cell dyscrasia. Both these diagnoses increase in prevalence with age and can be followed annually in clinic in the absence of clinical features of hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal dysfunction. However, together with elevated LDH and cryoglobulin levels and hypocomplementemia, especially of C4 or consistent clinical phenotype (Table 1), these may also support consideration of MGUS‐ or lymphoid malignancy–associated cryoglobulinemia or amyloidosis (Figure 2). In patients developing vasculitis or perivascular inflammation during treatment of solid tumors, especially with neutrophilia and possibly circulating blasts on CBC, we look for antecedent granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) exposure.

Should patients be transferred to intensive care?

If a patient with a neutropenic event is considered sufficiently ill to warrant intensive care, then the transfer is almost always appropriate. One exception might be the patient who is being treated in the palliative setting who has clear evidence of refractory disease with little possibility of effective alternative systemic therapy. However, just because a patient does not have a curable disease, intensive care should not be ruled out. Ideally, such difficult decisions will be rendered unnecessary through previous discussions with the patient about their end-of-life care and by swift, appropriate management of febrile neutropenia.

Late side effects with 223Ra-Cl2 include anemia that affected 90% or more of patients and was more severe in 6% of both treatment and placebo groups; lymphocytopenia affected up to 92% and was moderate to severe in 20%, and neutropenia affected 20%, with the rate of infections not different between treatment and placebo groups in the ALSYMPCA trial; low platelets affected 34% of patients; bone marrow failure resulting in pancytopenia is estimated to affect 2% of patients; radionuclide therapy could theoretically cause a secondary cancer, with risk likely less than 1% and usually taking years to occur, and this is unlikely to affect the length or quality of life of patients with mCRPC.

Infection patterns after CAR T-cell therapy — The majority of infections tend to occur during the first 30 to 90 d after CAR T cells infusion, with early events (< 30 d) largely related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy toxicity and dominated by bacterial infections followed by viral and then fungal infections; infections occurring after 30 d are mainly caused by CAR T cells–associated prolonged neutropenia and T cells lymphopenia, and by B-cells aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia; late infections (> 30 d) are largely viral then bacterial then fungal; in multiple myeloma patients treated with anti-BCMA CAR T cells, infections tend to occur more frequently but later than with anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and the majority of events occur by d 100 after infusion and are represented largely by respiratory tract viral and bacterial infections.

What should be assessed initially?

The initial assessment is clinical, beginning with the patient's vital signs, including the consciousness level, respiration, circulation and temperature.

Any chemotherapy patient who is clinically septic should be regarded as a medical emergency. If the assessment is taking place in primary care, it is essential for the GP to be aware that the patient is undergoing chemotherapy, and to have a low threshold for referral to hospital. To optimise communication at this stage, many chemotherapy services give patients an information sheet, outlining details of their chemotherapy regimen, advice on the signs of febrile neutropenia and guidance on when and where patients who may need treatment should be referred.

### Association of baseline and longitudinal low neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and high lymphocyte counts (LCs) with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in real world advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients (pts) treated with nivolumab (nivo) or pembrolizumab (pembro) [^113NMeFU]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract e21020 Background: High baseline neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is associated with inferior OS for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC pts treated with nivo or pembro. This study evaluates potential relationships between baseline and longitudinal NLR and absolute LCs with PFS and OS in aNSCLC pts on nivo or pembro. Results: The study included 162 aNSCLC pts. Median age 68 yrs, male/female 40. 1%/59. 9%. NLR > 5. 0 was associated with inferior PFS longitudinally. Median PFS values were: baseline NLR > 5/ < 5 = 2. 1/3. 9 mos, at 6 wks NLR > 5/ < 5 = 
2. 6/6. 1 mos, at 12 wks NLR > 5/ < 5 = 
3. 8/7. 1 mos. NLR > 5. 0 was similarly associated with inferior OS at the same intervals. In time-dependent analyses, NLRs as a continuous variable were associated with inferior PFS and OS.

Longitudinal analyses of LCs as a continuous variable showed that higher LCs over time were associated with superior PFS and OS. Conclusions: Low baseline and longitudinally lower NLRs are associated with longer PFS and OS in aNSCLC pts on nivo or pembro. High baseline and longitudinally higher LCs were associated with superior PFS and OS in the same group. While NLRs and LCs may merely be prognostic indicators, it's possible that they reflect a patient's ability to mount an immune response. They may also be useful in guiding strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.

### Association of low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) and high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios (LMR) with overall survival and response to induction chemotherapy (IC) when used to select patients (pts) with locally advanced squamous cell of the larynx (LSCC) for combined chemoradiation (CRT) [^111xrqyr]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract e17539 Background: University of Michigan Cancer Center protocol 9520 treated pts with stage III/IV LSCC with 1 cycle of cisplatin & 5-FU to select pts for definitive therapy. Pts whose tumors attained a ≥ 50% response after 1 cycle of PF underwent CRT. Those who had a < 50% response to IC were treated with total laryngectomy + RT. Correlative science from UMCC 9520 demonstrated that an increased percentage of CD4+ cells predicted response to PF & suggested improved survival. Published retrospective data also has demonstrated that lower NLR & higher LMR are associated with improved prognosis in p16- SCC of the oropharynx & pyriform sinus, while cancers with higher NLR & lower LMR have a worse prognosis. Similar to our previous correlative analysis, this study is also a secondary analysis of the predictive value of NLR & LMR in a prospective trial of bio-selective IC.

Methods: NLR & LMR were calculated from pre-treatment CBC for all pts enrolled onto UMCC 9520. Results: All 87 pts received IC with PF. 65/87 responded to IC & received CRT. Results of response to IC compared the NLR & LMR ratios by logistic regression analysis & was used to create NLR & LMR cut points. Among pts with LMR ≥ 3, the response rate was 89% while the RR was 64% with LMR < 3. Among pts with NLR <
4. 7, the RR was 79% while the RR of pts with > 4. 7 was 58%. Overall & disease specific survivals were greater in pts with LMR ≥ 3. Conclusions: Higher LMR & lower NLR are associated with favorable responses to IC & LMR ≥ 3 is associated with improved survival. This data correlates strongly with our published results from UMCC 9520, whereby elevated circulating CD4+ lymphocytes predict response to IC & survival.

This important information may help direct the design of future laryngeal preservation protocols.

### The frequency of low polymorphonuclear leukocyte with high lymphocytic differential counts… [^114vtDeU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the course of routine blood examinations made in Lane Hospital, San Francisco, it had been frequently noted that the polymorphonuclear leukocytes were below 60 per cent. in apparently normal individuals, and also that the lymphocytes ran over 40 per cent, in a sufficient number of apparently normal persons to make a differential count of somewhat doubtful value in the diagnosis of exophthalmic goiter, etc. In order to determine, if possible, the cause of these variations from the commonly accepted standard, the blood of one hundred normal individuals was examined. These were selected with a view to including outdoor as well as indoor workers, females as well as males, and ages between 21 and 50; in short, to approximate as nearly as possible, the average individual appearing in the clinics or hospital. Among those examined were physicians, students and nurses at Lane Hospital, soldiers at the Presidio and such. MEHRTENS HG.

### Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with mortality and cardiovascular disease… [^116jPp5V]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was prospectively and significantly associated with all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, and heart failure in the Jackson Heart Study. The associations were also significantly modified by the Duffy antigen negative trait in the Jackson Heart Study. Meaning Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with cancer and chronic disease outcome at diagnosis and may also be associated with mortality, coronary heart disease, and heart failure; the Duffy antigen variant may modify the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio association with mortality and cardiovascular-related outcomes. -to-lymphocyte ratio. 8 The NLR reflects the balance between the innate and adaptive immune responses in the body. 3, 4 This work has spurred the investigation of NLR as a predictor of CVD and overall mortality, with studies now confirming an elevated NLR to be a significant predictor of adverse CVD outcomes.

3, 4, 9–15. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was calculated for each participant by dividing the reported total absolute neutrophil counts by the total absolute lymphocyte counts. Here, we demonstrate that NLR is significantly associated with all-cause mortality in prospective cohorts. Our analyses with JHS data show significant associations between NLR with all-cause mortality and CHD, and the closer median time from the diagnosis of events were significantly associated with both NLR points in the JHS. Thus the lower determined NLR cutoff of at least 1. 77 showed significant associations with all outcomes: all-cause mortality, CHD, stroke, and HF among those with benign neutropenia. Using the higher NLR cutoff of at least 2. 15 revealed significant associations only with all-cause mortality and CHD among those with benign neutropenia.

These cells are immunoregulatory and are well known to suppress the lymphocyte response. 40 As a result, it is reasonable to speculate that the NLR is a measure of the phenotypic activity of gMDSCs that are released as a result of chronic disease insult. The increase in the neutrophils is observed because gMDSCs elaborated from the bone marrow can increase to some 10% of the peripheral blood leukocytes.
