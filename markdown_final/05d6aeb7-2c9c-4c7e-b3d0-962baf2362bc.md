## Question

evaluation of elevated hemoglobin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true erythrocytosis and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should classify the etiology into primary clonal, secondary, or relative causes. Next, I will outline the initial laboratory workup, including JAK2 testing and erythropoietin, and consider decision rules to optimize testing. After that, I should review targeted secondary investigations based on EPO level and clinical context. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including thresholds for intervention, phlebotomy, cytoreduction, and special populations, and close with a concise diagnostic algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the abnormal result and exclude spurious causes before labeling erythrocytosis, because I need to ensure we are dealing with a true increase in red cell mass rather than a testing artifact or relative polycythemia; I should repeat the CBC on a fresh sample, verify there is no hemoconcentration from dehydration or diuretics, and consider altitude, smoking, and laboratory interference, while remembering that WHO thresholds for investigating PV are hemoglobin greater than 16.5 g/dL in men or 16.0 g/dL in women, or hematocrit greater than 49% in men or 48% in women, and that sustained absolute erythrocytosis at higher thresholds can sometimes obviate the need for bone marrow biopsy if JAK2 and EPO criteria are met [^114NpGUc] [^11798zui].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify the disorder next because the downstream testing hinges on whether this is primary clonal erythrocytosis such as polycythemia vera, secondary erythrocytosis from hypoxia or EPO excess, or relative erythrocytosis from plasma volume contraction, and I need to keep in mind that JAK2-positive clonal disease typically shows low EPO, whereas secondary causes usually have normal or elevated EPO, and that relative erythrocytosis is common and often benign when plasma volume normalizes [^114NpGUc] [^1172nQUo].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory workup; let me verify that I include a CBC with indices and a peripheral smear, serum EPO, and JAK2 V617F testing with reflex JAK2 exon 12 if negative, because these are the cornerstone tests to separate PV from secondary causes, and I should consider using a simple CBC-based decision rule like JAK2-tree or JAKPOT to reduce unnecessary JAK2 testing while maintaining high sensitivity, which can meaningfully decrease testing volume in referral populations [^1172nQUo] [^117LF8R1] [^117DmHwm].

> Wait, let me verify the role of bone marrow biopsy; I initially thought a marrow would be required in all suspected PV, but hold on, I should confirm the WHO/ICC criteria because if there is sustained absolute erythrocytosis with hemoglobin greater than 18.5 g/dL in men or 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit greater than 55.5% in men or 49.5% in women, plus JAK2 mutation and subnormal EPO, the marrow criterion may be omitted, whereas in equivocal cases or when JAK2 is negative with low EPO, marrow can help distinguish PV mimics and other MPNs [^114NpGUc].

> I will now examine secondary causes if EPO is normal or elevated; let me consider hypoxia-related etiologies such as COPD, sleep apnea, and high altitude, screen for EPO-secreting tumors like renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma when clinically indicated, and I should double-check medications, especially exogenous testosterone and increasingly SGLT-2 inhibitors, which can raise hemoglobin via volume effects or altered renal oxygen sensing, prompting dose adjustment or discontinuation when feasible [^114yAWjp] [^116mfAx6] [^112RybHJ].

> But wait, what if EPO is low and JAK2 is negative; I need to check for rare congenital or familial erythrocytosis due to EPO receptor or oxygen-sensing pathway mutations such as VHL, PHD2, or HIF2A, and I should consider high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathies with a history, family screening, and hemoximetry or hemoglobin electrophoresis when suggested by personal or family history or discordant labs, recognizing that these are uncommon but important to identify for counseling and management [^1172nQUo] [^1148rerc].

> Let me think about relative erythrocytosis; I should confirm plasma volume status and reassess hemoglobin and hematocrit after adequate hydration and withdrawal of diuretics, because diuretic-induced or dehydration-related pseudopolycythemia is common and corrects with volume repletion, and I need to ensure I do not mislabel these patients as having true erythrocytosis before pursuing invasive or costly testing [^11798zui].

> Next, I should review management principles; for PV, I need to ensure thrombosis risk reduction with low-dose aspirin unless contraindicated, maintain a restrictive hematocrit target generally below 45% in men and 42% in women using phlebotomy, and consider cytoreductive therapy such as hydroxyurea or interferon when there is intolerance to phlebotomy, symptomatic disease, or high-risk features, while monitoring for cytopenias and second malignancies with hydroxyurea and teratogenicity with interferon [^114NpGUc].

> For secondary erythrocytosis, I should confirm and treat the underlying cause, such as optimizing COPD or sleep apnea management, removing offending drugs like testosterone or SGLT-2 inhibitors when possible, and reserve phlebotomy for symptomatic hyperviscosity or very high hematocrit after addressing reversible drivers, because indiscriminate phlebotomy can worsen hypoxia or even paradoxically increase thrombosis in some secondary forms, so I need to be cautious and individualized [^114yAWjp] [^116mfAx6] [^116bAAki].

> I should double-check special populations; in testosterone therapy, I need to measure baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit, withhold therapy if hematocrit exceeds 50% pretreatment, and intervene if hematocrit reaches 54% or higher, typically by dose reduction or temporary cessation and phlebotomy if needed, with ongoing monitoring every 6 to 12 months once stable, and I should remember that injectables carry a higher risk of erythrocytosis than transdermal preparations [^112RybHJ] [^111y36Jo].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic algorithm to ensure coherence; confirm true erythrocytosis with repeat testing and exclude spurious causes, classify as primary clonal, secondary, or relative, obtain EPO and JAK2 testing with selective use of CBC-based decision rules to reduce unnecessary testing, pursue bone marrow only when criteria are not met or when JAK2 is negative with low EPO, and then tailor secondary investigations to EPO level and clinical context before initiating disease-specific management, which aligns with contemporary WHO/ICC criteria and pragmatic hematology practice [^114NpGUc] [^117LF8R1] [^117DmHwm].

> Key takeaway: I need to ensure that I never anchor on a single elevated hemoglobin value, because confirming persistence, excluding spurious causes, and classifying the etiology drive appropriate testing and therapy; using JAK2 and EPO early, applying decision rules to avoid overtesting, and individualizing management to clonal versus secondary disease yields safer, more cost-effective care and reduces unnecessary procedures like routine bone marrow biopsies in straightforward PV presentations [^114NpGUc] [^117DmHwm] [^11798zui].

Elevated hemoglobin is defined as **> 16.5 g/dL in men or > 16.0 g/dL in women** [^114NpGUc] and requires a structured evaluation to distinguish true from relative erythrocytosis and identify underlying causes. The key steps are: **confirm the elevation with repeat CBC**, exclude spurious causes (dehydration, smoking, altitude), and classify as primary clonal (e.g. polycythemia vera), secondary (hypoxia, EPO-secreting tumors, testosterone, SGLT-2 inhibitors) [^116mfAx6], or relative (plasma volume contraction). Initial tests include **JAK2 mutation analysis** [^117LF8R1], serum erythropoietin [^1172nQUo], and a **basic metabolic panel**; further workup is guided by results and clinical context. Management targets the cause: phlebotomy and cytoreduction for PV [^notfound], treating hypoxia or removing offending agents for secondary causes, and addressing volume status for relative erythrocytosis.

---

## Definition and diagnostic thresholds

According to WHO and ICC criteria, **elevated hemoglobin** is defined as > 16.5 g/dL in men or > 16.0 g/dL in women [^114NpGUc]. These thresholds guide the evaluation of erythrocytosis and help distinguish physiological from pathological elevations.

---

## Initial evaluation

### Confirmatory testing

Repeat CBC is essential to **confirm persistence** of elevation and exclude laboratory error. Concurrent measurement of **hematocrit** helps assess red cell mass and distinguish true from relative erythrocytosis [^11686JZY].

---

### Clinical history and examination

A thorough history and physical examination should assess symptoms (headache, dizziness, pruritus, fatigue), risk factors (smoking, altitude, testosterone use, family history), and signs of hypoxia or malignancy. This clinical context guides the **differential diagnosis** and selection of tests [^116mfAx6].

---

## Classification of erythrocytosis

Erythrocytosis is classified into **three main categories**:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary clonal | Intrinsic bone marrow disorder with autonomous erythroid proliferation | - Polycythemia vera (PV) [^114NpGUc] |
| Secondary | Increased erythropoietin (EPO) production due to hypoxia or EPO-secreting tumors | - Chronic hypoxia (COPD, sleep apnea) <br/> - EPO-secreting tumors (renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma) <br/> - Testosterone therapy [^116mfAx6] <br/> - SGLT-2 inhibitors [^116mfAx6] |
| Relative | Reduced plasma volume causing hemoconcentration | - Dehydration <br/> - Diuretic use <br/> - Gaisböck syndrome |

---

## Essential laboratory investigations

### Initial laboratory tests

- **JAK2 mutation analysis**: JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutations are present in ~95% of PV cases [^notfound]; testing is the first-line molecular test [^1172nQUo].
- **Serum erythropoietin (EPO)**: Low EPO supports PV; normal or high EPO suggests secondary erythrocytosis [^1172nQUo].
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Evaluate renal and hepatic function; identify occult malignancy or organ dysfunction [^114LTZ97].

---

### Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

- **Pulmonary function tests and sleep apnea screening**: For suspected hypoxic lung disease or sleep apnea [^notfound].
- **Abdominal imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI)**: Evaluate for renal, hepatic, or adrenal masses if EPO-mediated erythrocytosis is suspected [^notfound].
- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Evaluate for high-affinity hemoglobins or other hemoglobinopathies [^111wbP4h].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of elevated hemoglobin includes:

- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by JAK2 mutations and low EPO [^114NpGUc].
- **Secondary erythrocytosis**: Due to chronic hypoxia, EPO-secreting tumors, or medications (testosterone, SGLT-2 inhibitors) [^116mfAx6].
- **Relative erythrocytosis**: Hemoconcentration from dehydration or plasma volume contraction [^11686JZY].
- **Congenital erythrocytosis**: Rare genetic disorders affecting oxygen sensing or EPO pathway [^1148rerc].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Polycythemia vera**: Phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit < 45%, low-dose aspirin, and cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, interferon, ruxolitinib) for high-risk patients [^notfound].
- **Secondary erythrocytosis**: Treat underlying cause (oxygen therapy, removal of EPO-secreting tumor, discontinuation of offending medications) [^116mfAx6].
- **Relative erythrocytosis**: Address volume status, hydration, and discontinue diuretics if appropriate [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated erythrocytosis can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Thrombosis**: Increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis due to hyperviscosity [^notfound].
- **Hypertension**: Common in PV and secondary erythrocytosis [^notfound].
- **Pruritus**: Characteristic symptom in PV [^notfound].
- **Fatigue and cognitive symptoms**: Due to hyperviscosity and microcirculatory disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor hematocrit, hemoglobin, and symptoms, with individualized targets based on the underlying cause and patient-specific factors. Ongoing clinical reassessment should track symptoms, thrombotic events, and treatment response to guide therapy adjustments [^1164ixsw].

---

Elevated hemoglobin requires a **structured approach**: confirm the abnormality, classify the erythrocytosis, and target management to the cause. This strategy optimizes outcomes and reduces complications.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^111jKc1a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the current World Health Organization (WHO) hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs to define anemia comparable to statistical and physiological Hb cutoffs calculated using representative surveys from multiple countries collected in the last 20 years?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 79 950 Hb observations from population-based surveys that covered all WHO geographical regions, the WHO cutoffs for defining anemia were higher than the fifth percentile of nearly all countries except the US. This finding held for children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years and was confirmed using a physiological measure of increased red blood cell production.

Meaning

These findings suggest that lower Hb cutoffs based on pooled multinational data can be considered for defining anemia among children and nonpregnant women.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^115BrY5w]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^111Ucimy]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

On the basis of data from more than 39 000 individuals from 25 countries examined, the current WHO hemoglobin cutoff levels for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women were found to be significantly higher than the fifth percentile of Hb in apparently healthy individuals from most countries evaluated. Future studies focusing on Hb thresholds associated with functional and clinical health outcomes will improve the understanding of overall disease burden. Until then, revising Hb cutoff level definitions according to pooled multinational data could be considered.

### Glycated hemoglobin and associated risk factors in older adults [^113ZHfF3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are considered to be appropriate tests for diagnosing pre-diabetes and/or diabetes while OGTT is also considered an appropriate test for assessing diabetes risk in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). As an alternative to these methods, an International Expert Committee, including representatives of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), recently recommended evaluating glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), with a cut-off point of ≥ 6.5% to diagnose diabetes (the HbA1c of young, lean and healthy subjects is approximately 5.0%). This strategy was endorsed and adopted by the ADA in 2010.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated HbA1c is associated with cardiovascular and ischemic heart disease risk. Both obesity and physical inactivity are considered to play important roles in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, with the ADA recommending that people with HbA1c of 5.7–6.4% undergo moderate weight loss (7% of initial body mass), as well as increasing physical activity to at least 150 min/week of moderate activity.

Ageing is another factor that contributes to variance in HbA1c and diabetes risk. Even in nondiabetic adults with normal fasting glucose, HbA1c steadily increase with age, such that at 70+ years of age it is 5.5%, almost attaining the ADA criterion for prediabetes. It should be noted, however, that ageing is also associated with a number of risk factors common to the sedentary/obese lifestyle that are expected to be associated with elevated HbA1c levels, including increased body and abdominal fat, a more atherogenic lipid profile, diabetes, elevated inflammatory markers, decreased cardiorespiratory fitness and reduced physical activity. Any, or all, of these risk factors are expected to be associated with elevated HbA1c levels. There is, however, little information as to what extent factors such as obesity or physical inactivity in older adults modify HbA1c levels above and beyond the effect of aging, per se. This knowledge is essential for determining whether or not 1) lowering HbA1c by diet and exercise is a realistic goal for obese and inactive elderly subjects and 2), if this is indeed achievable, what should be the target levels HbA1c to attain?

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

Baseline evaluation before ESA initiation: Before offering an ESA, clinicians should conduct an appropriate history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests to identify alternative causes of anemia aside from chemotherapy or an underlying hematologic malignancy; such causes should be appropriately addressed before considering the use of ESAs, with suggested baseline investigations listed in Table 1 (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11117rvm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper discusses tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with particular reference to the 1997 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The potential benefits of the lower diagnostic threshold for fasting plasma glucose are not well defined. However, the change in the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes mellitus affects as many as 1.9 million persons in the United States; therefore, the medical and social costs of the lower threshold may be considerable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined by a threshold imposed on the continuous distribution of glycemic levels, typically with respect to risk for microvascular complications. However, the burden of type 2 diabetes relates more to macrovascular than microvascular complications. Because no clear threshold exists for macrovascular complications, a formal balancing of direct and indirect costs with both microvascular and macrovascular complications may be appropriate to establish glycemic thresholds. Because fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test all predict diabetic complications yet test reliability is better for fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c than for the oral glucose tolerance test, we suggest an alternative diagnostic approach: If random plasma glucose is elevated (≥ 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) and the hemoglobin A1c level is more than 2 SDs above the laboratory mean, then diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed, and management should be based on the hemoglobin A1c level. If the result of only one of these tests is positive, then fasting plasma glucose should be tested to evaluate the patient for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus. The glycemic threshold for type 2 diabetes should be established by cost-effectiveness analysis. The clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be streamlined by incorporation of hemoglobin A1c into established criteria.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^112RybHJ]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — hemoglobin/hematocrit monitoring and polycythemia risk: Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Prior to commencing therapy, all patients should undergo a baseline measurement of Hb/Hct; if the Hct exceeds 50%, clinicians should consider withholding testosterone therapy until the etiology is explained, and while on therapy, a Hct ≥ 54% warrants intervention. In men with elevated Hct and high on-treatment testosterone levels, dose adjustment should be attempted as first-line management; in men with elevated Hct and low/normal on-treatment testosterone levels, measuring a SHBG level and a free testosterone level using a reliable assay is suggested. If SHBG levels are low/free testosterone levels are high, dose adjustment of the testosterone therapy should be considered, and men with elevated Hct and on-treatment low/normal total and free testosterone levels should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and possible coordination of phlebotomy. Polycythemia is generally defined as a hematocrit (Hct) > 52%. Elevation of Hb/Hct is the most frequent adverse event related to testosterone therapy, and Hb/Hct generally rise for the first six months and then tend to plateau. Across 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of men with mean baseline testosterone < 300 ng/dL treated for 12 weeks to 1 year, elevated Hct was more common with testosterone (OR = 6.46; CI: 1.86, 22.40). Trials indicate injectable testosterone is associated with the greatest treatment-induced increases in Hb/Hct, and a meta-analysis found mean Hb increases of 1.4 mg/dL (long-acting IM), 1.6 mg/dL (short-acting IM), 0.9 mg/dL (transdermal), and 0.7 mg/dL (topical patches).

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111y36Jo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA testosterone deficiency — follow-up laboratory testing (hemoglobin/hematocrit) recommends: At baseline, Recommendation: Measure baseline levels to ensure pre-treatment level is < 50%. During the testosterone titration phase, Optional: Clinical judgment is recommended to determine need for hemoglobin/hematocrit monitoring depending on baseline levels and the duration of time required to reach therapeutic target levels. In the stable phase, Recommendation: Measure every 6–12 months or sooner depending on prior values to maintain hematocrit levels below 54%.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Sustained hyperglycemia among patients with diabetes: what matters when action is needed? [^114j56E5]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical inertia among patients with diabetes reflects the proportion of patients with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and no intensification of pharmacological therapy. Prior research has found that between 33 and 66% of patients with an elevated A1C do not have timely intensification of their medications. Numerous clinical trials have provided consistent evidence of the detriment of prolonged periods of hyperglycemia among adults with type 2 diabetes, and few would argue that once A1C values are substantially and consistently above target levels, intensification of pharmacological therapy is warranted.

Although the presence of poor control in diabetes has been documented, the extent to which patients with diabetes incur sustained periods of poor control and no recent medication intensification is not well quantified. Nor is it known what factors eventually facilitate the receipt of appropriate care once a patient incurs a sustained period of poor control. Among a cohort of patients initiating oral monotherapy, we report the risk of, and factors associated with, sustained hyperglycemia and evaluate factors associated with receipt of appropriate care among individuals with sustained hyperglycemia.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Not so benign haematology: anaemia of the elderly [^117KoYiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

### Debate: transfusing to normal hemoglobin levels improves outcome [^114KA2Nf]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Red cells are uniquely designed to transport oxygen and facilitate oxygen uptake by systemic tissues. Blood transfusions are thus logical therapeutic choices in patients who exhibit signs of oxygen debt. A small number of studies that have addressed patients with metabolic or physiologic signs of oxygen debt or regional ischaemia suggest that liberal blood transfusion strategies improve outcome. Therefore, armed with an understanding of the variety of clinical presentations characterising oxygen debt, as well as an appreciation of the risks involved, blood transfusions should be considered in all critically ill patients. This includes the consideration of liberalized hemoglobin triggers and hemoglobin thresholds in normal ranges.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review [^1143kRH8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers of tissue hypoxia

A special interest in the study of anemia lies in markers of tissue hypoxia. Indicators such as methemoglobin and erythropoietin can serve as markers of anemia-induced tissue hypoxia. It is suggested that an increase in methemoglobin may be associated with an elevated risk of stroke, and assessing its level could be valuable in the management of anemia. Erythropoietin has also shown an increase in response to tissue hypoxia and may be considered a marker of anemia-induced renal hypoxia. However, further research on markers of anemia-induced tissue hypoxia and their role in the decision-making regarding blood transfusion is needed.

As seen from Table 4, current mainstream recommendations from professional medical societies for blood transfusion generally rely primarily on hemoglobin levels. At the same time, several alternative triggers for making decisions about blood transfusion have not gained widespread acknowledgment within these recommendations. However, many experts acknowledge the imperfections of hemoglobin levels as an isolated trigger for blood transfusion and the limitations in its application.

The recognition of the imperfections and limitations associated with relying solely on hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion decisions underscores the need for substantial clinical research into alternative transfusion triggers. Large clinical studies are crucial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these alternative triggers, taking into account diverse patient populations and clinical scenarios.

A personalized strategy could consider not only hemoglobin levels but also other relevant clinical parameters, patient-specific factors, and physiological considerations. This personalized approach aims to optimize transfusion practices, ensuring a more tailored and effective intervention while minimizing unnecessary transfusions and associated risks.

In essence, the call for large clinical studies and the exploration of personalized approaches in the context of blood transfusion decisions stem from the recognition that a more nuanced understanding of patient needs and responses is essential to enhance the precision and appropriateness of transfusion practices.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^115QPZZY]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin/hematocrit testing before endoscopy — routine screening is not advised for minor procedures without anemia symptoms, but selective testing is appropriate for high-risk scenarios. Severe anemia is found in less than 1% of asymptomatic patients, and a hemoglobin level less than 8 mg/dL has been associated with cardiac morbidity and operative death. Although determining a baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit level is recommended before major surgery with anticipated significant blood loss, such testing is not recommended for patients undergoing minor surgeries in the absence of clinical findings suggestive of anemia. Measurement of hemoglobin should be considered for patients with preexisting anemia or risk factors for bleeding, a high risk of adverse events with significant bleeding, advanced liver disease, or a hematologic disorder when undergoing endoscopic procedures in which there is a high risk of bleeding adverse events.

Patient evaluation — recommendations specify to review previous records and interview the patient or family to identify prior transfusion history, drug-induced or congenital coagulopathy, thrombotic events, and organ ischemia risks; to review hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation profiles; to order additional tests based on the medical condition; to perform a focused physical examination for bleeding signs; and to conduct the preoperative evaluation sufficiently in advance (e.g., several days to weeks) to allow preparation.

### Establishing an evidence base for critical laboratory value thresholds [^112XapNh]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Critical values denote laboratory test results indicating a life-threatening situation. The outcomes of this premise have not been rigorously evaluated.

Methods

Five years of inpatient admissions were examined for critical or "near-critical" results (total admissions = 165,066; total test results = 872,503). In-hospital mortality was examined as a function of time and degree of test result abnormality.

Results

Some critical value thresholds appropriately identified patients at risk for death (eg, elevated potassium). Other thresholds were too conservative (elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin) or not conservative enough (elevated lactate). Mortality risk for most critical values was time dependent, but some critical values showed no temporal effect on mortality (elevated activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], international normalized ratio [INR], and glucose). Following an initial critical result, further worsening was associated with increased mortality. Prior hospital admission within 30 days was a predictor of lower mortality for some (elevated APTT, INR, potassium, and sodium; low glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and potassium) but not other critical values (elevated lactate, glucose, hematocrit, and hemoglobin; low sodium).

Conclusions

Only a subset of laboratory critical value thresholds was optimally chosen for increased risk of in-hospital mortality, with a time urgency for most but not all critical values. For many tests, a prior hospital admission imparted a decreased risk of in-hospital death.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^1154ezE1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for anaemia of CKD

Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 1.1–1.6)

Guideline 1.1 – Evaluation of anaemia - screening for anaemia

We suggest that haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be routinely measured to screen for anaemia:
at least annually in patients with CKD G3 and
at least twice a year in patients with CKD G4–5 not on dialysis (2B)

Audit measure

Proportion of CKD patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min (using 4 variable MDRD or CKD-EPI) method with an annual Hb level.

Rationale

There is insufficient literature to suggest the ideal frequency of Hb testing in CKD patients who are not on ESA therapy. Alternatively data from clinical trials have shown that the rate of Hb decline in these patients is gradual one. In a Canadian study to assess the effect of ESA therapy on left ventricular mass in patients with CKD 172 patients were assigned to either receive therapy with erythropoietin α subcutaneously to maintain or achieve Hb level targets of 120 to 140 g/L, or to the control/delayed treatment group with mean Hb levels of 90 ± 5 g/L. During 2 years follow up a significant proportion of patients eventually required ESA therapy. However, among those who did not require ESA therapy, mean Hb values remained relatively stable throughout the study period. Hb level should be measured at least monthly in CKD G5 haemodialysis patients and every 3 months in CKD G5 peritoneal dialysis patients.

KDIGO 2012 guidelines suggest measurement of Hb at least annually in patients with CKD G3, at least twice per year in patients with CKD G4–5ND and at least every 3 months in patients with CKD G5HD and CKD G5 PD. For those treated with an ESA, they recommend measuring Hb concentration when clinically indicated and at least every 3 months in patients with CKD G3–5ND and CKD G5PD and at least monthly in patients with CKD G5HD

Guideline 1.2 - evaluation of anaemia - Haemoglobin level

We recommend that all patients with chronic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease should be investigated for the cause and possible treatment, irrespective of the grade of kidney disease or requirement for renal replacement therapy if:
their haemoglobin (Hb) levels are less than 110 g/L (less than 105 g/L if younger than 2 years) or
they develop symptoms attributable to anaemia

This is to ensure the correct diagnosis and management of anaemia. (1A)

### Impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on mortality in acute stroke: analysis of UK regional registry data, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^113kkBa8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Meta‐analyses of pooled results showed that anemia is associated with an increased risk of mortality in ischemic stroke (pooled OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.57–2.47) (Figure 5). We also found a significant association for the evaluation of anemia and mortality in hemorrhagic stroke, albeit at a lower magnitude of association (OR 1.46, 95% 1.23–1.74) (Figure 6). The number of studies providing ORs for the relationship between elevated hemoglobin and stroke mortality was insufficient for a meta‐analysis to be conducted. Although available data suggest that elevated hemoglobin predicts short‐term mortality in ischemic stroke, findings are less consistent for hemorrhagic stroke (Table 7). The funnel plot depicting ORs for mortality in anemic ischemic stroke patients shows asymmetry (Figure 7), with an underrepresentation of studies on the left side that we would typically expect to consist of those reporting no significant harm in the relationship between anemia and stroke mortality. We encountered 5 such studies that reported no significant association in our systematic review that we could not incorporate into the meta‐analysis because ORs were not given, causing asymmetry in the funnel plot.

### Re-evaluation of hematocrit as a determinant of thrombotic risk in erythrocytosis [^116bAAki]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Here we critically evaluate the role of elevated hematocrit as the principal determinant of thrombotic risk in polycythemia and erythrocytosis, defined by an expansion of red cell mass. Since red cell volume determination is no longer readily available, in clinical practice, polycythemia and erythrocytosis are defined by elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. Thrombosis is common in Chuvash erythrocytosis and polycythemia vera. Although the increased thrombotic risk is assumed to be due to the elevated hematocrit and an associated increase in blood viscosity, thrombosis does not accompany most types of erythrocytosis. We review studies indicating that the occurrence of thrombosis in Chuvash erythrocytosis is independent of hematocrit, that the thrombotic risk is paradoxically increased by phlebotomy in Chuvash erythrocytosis, and that, when compared to chemotherapy, phlebotomy is associated with increased thrombotic risk in polycythemia vera. Inherited and environmental causes that lead to polycythemia and erythrocytosis are accompanied by diverse cellular changes that could directly affect thrombotic risk, irrespective of the elevated hematocrit. The pressing issue in these disorders is to define factors other than elevated hematocrit that determine thrombotic risk. Defining these predisposing factors in polycythemia and erythrocytosis should then lead to rational therapies and facilitate development of targeted interventions.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO / ASH clinical practice guideline update [^114kG2YY]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Work-up before ESA initiation in chemotherapy-associated anemia — Recommendation 4 indicates that before offering an ESA, clinicians should conduct an appropriate history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests to identify alternative causes of anemia aside from chemotherapy or an underlying hematopoietic malignancy, and such causes should be appropriately addressed before considering ESAs; suggested baseline investigations include thorough drug exposure history, review of a peripheral blood smear, analyses for iron studies, folate/vitamin B12 or hemoglobinopathy screening, assessment of reticulocyte count, occult blood loss, and renal insufficiency, baseline erythropoietin level, and testing of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level where indicated, with possible addition of direct antiglobulin testing for selected patients; these suggestions are based on Expert Panel consensus, are not comprehensive, and in some cases, a bone marrow examination is noted.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: a measured response to a critical review [^1175zjQv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

In a systematic evaluation of 450 studies and 494 clinical scenarios, investigators reported that: "Decisions to transfuse RBCs are often based on unsubstantiated Hb level or hematocrit 'triggers'". The authors concluded that 59% of transfusions actually reduced "well-being" defined as the health of the transfusion recipient (and therefore were considered inappropriate) and 29% had no benefit.

Clinicians are even less aware of the costs of blood transfusions than the potential risks. Although the acquisition cost of a unit of blood varies between $200 and $250 in most hospitals, activity-based costing that considers all of the other costs associated with administering blood reveals a total cost between $522 and $1,183 per unit and probably more when adjusted for inflation and other factors.

Given the risks and costs of RBC transfusions, there is a growing recognition of the need for strategies to reduce unnecessary transfusions. The American Medical Association's Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement and the Joint Commission, with participation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently identified RBC transfusions as 1 of the top 5 overused procedures in medicine. The Joint Commission has also introduced measures that track the appropriateness of RBC transfusion as a continuous quality indicator. e

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: a measured response to a critical review [^117QZpio]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

7. The appropriate indications for transfusion, risks of transfusion, and limitations of using a single hemoglobin measurement to transfuse should be considered.

Those that presume SpHb is intended to replace lab-Hb often make the point that a single Hb value varying > 1 g/dL from the "real" Hb value may result in an incorrect transfusion decision. This assertion is in contrast to established best transfusion practices that stipulate that the decision to transfuse should consider a variety of factors, including whether (1) the patient is actively bleeding, (2) signs and symptoms of anemia are present, (3) absolute Hb level, (4) whether Hb is changing or stable, (5) patient health and adaptive cardiovascular response ability, and (6) possibilities for increasing oxygen delivery without a transfusion. –

RBC transfusion is one of the most frequent procedures performed in United States hospitals, occurring in 1 in 10 inpatients. Meta-analysis from risk-adjusted observational studies shows that RBC transfusions are associated with a 69% increase in mortality, an 88% increase in infection, and a 250% increase in the incidence of adult respiratory distress syndrome. An analysis of 941,496 operations involving 15,186 transfused patients revealed a dose-dependent association of intraoperative RBC transfusion with increased risk of mortality, wound problems, pulmonary complications, postoperative renal dysfunction, systemic sepsis, composite morbidity, and postoperative length of stay when compared with propensity-matched not-transfused patients. Restrictive transfusion practices, in which RBC transfusions are given at lower-than-usual Hb threshold, have been shown to be safe in multiple randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis indicates they result in a 23% lower in-hospital mortality.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114yAWjp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia

Hemoglobin assessment is important in patients with COPD. Polycythemia can indicate untreated hypoxemia, whereas anemia, a frequent concomitant morbidity in stable COPD with a prevalence of 5–30%, may contribute to breathlessness. Patients with anemia tend to be older, with worse airflow limitation and a higher burden of cardiac and metabolic comorbidities than nonanemic patients. There is an association between anemia and elevated CRP concentration, a cytokine often augmented during an ECOPD. Although there does not appear to be a relationship between the presence of anemia and ECOPD incidence, it seems logical that coexistent anemia may worsen the dyspnea that is characteristic of such episodes and so impact ECOPD severity. Patients with comorbid COPD and anemia tend to have longer hospital stays and are at increased risk of death, perhaps through association with comorbidities.

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^1152gK26]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO / ASH clinical practice guideline update [^115vdbH4]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

ASCO/ASH erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) guideline — key clinical questions for chemotherapy-associated anemia address pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation to identify likely responders; comparative safety/efficacy of darbepoetin, epoetin beta and alfa originator, and currently available biosimilars of epoetin alfa; whether ESAs increase the risk of thromboembolism; and recommendations for ESA dosing and dose modifications with the recommended target HgB level. Questions also define nonresponse as < 1 to 2 g/dL increase in HgB or no decrease in transfusion requirements and ask whether continuation beyond 6 to 8 weeks provides a benefit, and whether iron supplementation concurrent with an ESA reduces transfusion requirements.

### JAK2-tree: a simple CBC-based decision rule to guide appropriate JAK2 V617F mutation testing [^117LF8R1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The JAK2 V617F mutation is highly recurrent in many of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, a molecular variant that can be easily detected using sensitive and minimally invasive techniques. Given the ease of JAK2 V617F testing, this test may be improperly requested for the purposes of patient 'screening' and to optimise laboratory resource utilisation, it behooves clinicians and laboratorians to perform JAK2 V617F testing only when most appropriate.

Methods

To assist with the screening of patients being considered for JAK2 V617F testing, we developed a clinical decision rule, "JAK2-tree", which can be easily applied to basic CBC parameters (haemoglobin, platelet and white blood cell counts).

Results

We tested JAK2-tree on two independent datasets, one an unselected population-based sample (the Copenhagen General Population Study) and the other an historical clinical laboratory referral set, with sensitivities for JAK2 V617F detection of 91% and 94%, respectively. As applied to the historical laboratory referral dataset, moreover, the JAK2-tree algorithm would have reduced JAK2 V617F testing volume over the period of evaluation by 15%.

Conclusions

Our work supports a simple decision-tree-based screening approach to optimize the selection of patients most appropriate for JAK2 V617F testing.

### Cancer-associated thrombosis: updates and controversies [^114J81Aa]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Emerging data have enhanced our understanding of cancer-associated thrombosis, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This update will focus on recent findings, including the phenomenon of incidental venous thromboembolism (VTE), novel approaches to risk assessment, and the results of randomized clinical trials focusing on prophylaxis of cancer outpatients. Incidental VTE is an important contributor to rates of cancer-associated VTE and, in terms of outcomes, appears to be as consequential for patients as symptomatic VTE. Multiple biomarkers have been studied, with the highest level of evidence for prechemotherapy elevated platelet counts, elevated leukocyte counts, and low hemoglobin. Other candidate biomarkers, including D-dimer and tissue factor, are currently being evaluated. A recently validated risk score for chemotherapy-associated VTE has now been evaluated in more than 10 000 cancer patients in a variety of clinical settings and trials and is ready for clinical use (Level 1 clinical decision rule). Several randomized clinical trials in solid-tumor patients with low-molecular-weight heparins and semuloparin, an ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin, demonstrate clearly that outpatient thromboprophylaxis is feasible, safe, and effective. Selecting the appropriate patients for prophylaxis, however, continues to be a matter of controversy.

### JAK2-tree: a simple CBC-based decision rule to guide appropriate JAK2 V617F mutation testing [^112EFuZM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the JAK2-tree was not designed to be used in place of clinical acumen, and other specific clinical indications for testing that might be brought to bear in specific circumstances. Indeed, there may be specific and highly significant examples of non-CBC informed clinical indications that warrant JAK2 V617F testing. Such examples might include thrombotic events involving atypical sites; to provide molecular confirmation of a previous clinical diagnosis of an MPN; or for patients in which JAK2 V617F allele burden determination might influence therapy. In such instances, available CBC data might not support testing, clinical information notwithstanding. As such, laboratories are cautioned to defer to specific clinical history indicators and careful laboratory-to-clinic communication in this regard, as required. The JAK2-tree algorithm also does not distinguish between leukocytosis owing to lymphocytes or myeloid forms; in the context of isolated lymphocytosis, and without other clinical indications, JAK2 V617F testing would likely be unremarkable, despite algorithmic suggestion to the contrary.

Although we could not demonstrate significant changes in performance parameters with tandem application of the JAK2-tree algorithm, other algorithmic variations might be worth testing. For instance, assuming normal Hb and platelet count, the JAK2-tree approach suggests that a normal WBC would be sufficient for testing. Instead, and considering the minor WHO criteria for diagnosis of PMF, a laboratory might adjust the JAK2-tree algorithm to stipulate reflexive testing with an elevated WBC, and with a signal to discuss the request with the clinical team in instances of normal range (ie, 7–11×10⁹/L) WBC to confirm appropriateness.

Take home messages

Laboratory testing, especially testing employing molecular methods, should be appropriately optimised for the clinical scenario.
Clinical decision rules applied to laboratory testing can reduce costs and prevent waste.
Simple clinical decision rules like JAK2-tree can assist in appropriate test ordering.

### Recommendations for the use of mechanical circulatory support: ambulatory and community patient care: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115aCqM2]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support — hemolysis monitoring: A baseline level of hemolysis occurs in patients with MCS and may be monitored by periodic laboratory studies including urinalysis, plasma free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase analysis; baseline and serial measurements are helpful when obstruction or thrombosis is considered. Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase above the patient's baseline or 2.5 times the upper level of normal requires evaluation at an MCS center.

### A rational approach to JAK2 mutation testing in patients with elevated hemoglobin: results from the JAK2 prediction cohort (JAKPOT) study [^117DmHwm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrocytosis, most often measured as an increase in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, is a common reason for referral to internal medicine and hematology clinics and a rational approach is required to effectively identify patients with polycythemia vera while avoiding over-investigation.

Aim

We aimed to develop and validate a simple rule to predict JAK2 mutation positivity based on complete blood count parameters to aid in the diagnostic approach to patients referred for elevated hemoglobin.

Setting

Internal medicine and hematology clinics at an academic tertiary referral center.

Participants

The JAK2 Prediction Cohort (JAKPOT), a large retrospective cohort (n = 901) of patients evaluated by internal medicine and hematology specialists for elevated hemoglobin.

Design

JAK2 mutation analysis was performed in all patients and clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Patients were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts. A prediction rule was developed using data from the derivation cohort and tested in the validation cohort.

Key Results

The JAKPOT prediction rule included three variables: (i) red blood cell count > 6.45×10¹²/L, (ii) platelets > 350×10⁹/L, and (iii) neutrophils > 6.2×10⁹/L; absence of all criteria was effective at ruling out JAK2-positivity with sensitivities 94.7% and 100%, and negative predictive values of 98.8% and 100% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, with an overall low false negative rate of 0.4%. The rule was validated for three different methods of JAK2 testing. Applying this rule to our entire cohort would have resulted in over 50% fewer tests.

Conclusion

In patients with elevated hemoglobin, the use of a simple prediction rule helps to accurately identify patients with a low likelihood of having a JAK2 mutation, potentially limiting costly over-investigation in this common referral population.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^114mu8U3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Vadadustat (Vafseo) [^112CUyQC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1	Pre-Treatment and On-Treatment Evaluations of Anemia, Iron Stores, and Liver Tests

Evaluation of Anemia and Iron Stores

Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

Liver Testing

Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months and then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2	Important Dosing Information

Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL.

VAFSEO can be taken with or without food.

VAFSEO should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of VAFSEO is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose. In this case, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose taken at the usual time. Double doses should not be taken to make-up for a missed dose.

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^111REVos]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations & conclusion

Clinicians should adopt a systematic approach when elevated serum Cbl levels are encountered. A comprehensive clinical history and detailed physical examination are essential during the initial evaluation. If the patient is receiving Cbl supplementation, it should be discontinued at the time of presentation, and appropriate follow-up assessments should be scheduled. In the absence of pathological findings, re-evaluation of serum Cbl levels after four months is recommended. If clinical or physical abnormalities are present, condition-specific investigations should be pursued. In cases where hepatic or renal involvement is suspected, abdominal ultrasonography may be warranted. Additionally, periodic monitoring of serum Cbl levels every four months may be considered for surveillance purposes. In individuals with chronic conditions, serum Cbl levels may remain elevated or decline more slowly, even in the absence of supplementation. Therefore, regular monitoring of serum Cbl levels in this population is advised, as persistent elevation may serve as an early indicator of potential hematologic disorders later in life.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^1146czSR]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a disappearing entity [^1148rerc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis results when there is an increased red cell mass and thus an increased hemoglobin. The causes can be divided into primary intrinsic defects of the erythroid progenitor cell and secondary defects, where factors external to the erythroid compartment are responsible. Both can then be further divided into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital causes include mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and defects of the oxygen-sensing pathway including VHL, PHD2 and HIF2A mutations. When fully investigated there remain a number of patients in whom no cause can be elucidated who are currently described as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation should start with a full history and examination. Having eliminated the common entity polycythemia vera, further direction for investigation is guided by the erythropoietin level. Clinical consequences of the various erythrocytoses are not clear, but in some groups thromboembolic events have been described in young patients. Evidence is lacking to define best management, but aspirin and venesection to a target hematocrit should be considered.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

### Pathology consultation on patients with a large Rh immune globulin dose requirement [^115ahhmB]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the differential diagnosis and laboratory issues for women with a large calculated dose of Rh immune globulin (RhIG).

Methods

A case-based approach is used to review the differential diagnosis of patients with a large calculated dose of RhIG, RhIG dosing for women with baseline elevations in hemoglobin F, the formulations of RhIG, and issues for the transfusion medicine service with the release of large doses of RhIG.

Results

A large fetomaternal bleed after delivery requiring multiple doses of RhIG is rare. Such patients may require intravenous RhIG to avoid multiple injections. Patients with a large percentage of circulating fetal RBCs should be evaluated for a disorder of hemoglobin synthesis and, if present, should have quantification of the circulating fetal RBCs by flow cytometry.

Conclusions

Accurate laboratory evaluation of women with large fetomaternal bleeds is essential for appropriate RhIG administration.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^1174PUGe]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Importantly, the relation of A1C to average glucose levels, while good, is not perfect. On the other hand, it is conceivable that this "glycation gap" may actually offer an advantage in that it might better predict the risk of complications in individuals more susceptible to nonenzymatic glycation of a variety of proteins, including those fundamentally important to vascular biology. Nevertheless, we expect a significant amount of controversy in this regard.

Cost and lack of standardization of the A1C test in some countries are likely to be additional contentious issues following the recommendations of the committee. The experts do, however, recognize the difficulty and therefore envision a reasonably balanced approach: for those unable to obtain a standardized A1C test (or an affordable one), to continue to use the well-established methods of glucose testing — fasting and postchallenge glucose — the older diagnostic criteria of which will remain in place. A similar approach should apply to individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other disorders of red cell life span, particularly common in certain ethnic groups, because A1C measurement here may be unreliable.

There is likely to be some initial debate concerning the cut point — A1C of 6.5% — chosen to define diabetes. This is, of course, a problem whenever one coerces a diagnosis, which by definition must be dichotomous, from a continuous variable. Yet, one might argue that even the fasting glucose threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l), while not entirely arbitrary, represents a point along a continuum of metabolic derangement. Concern will be compounded by the fact that the upper limit of normal for A1C is 6.0%, leaving something of a gray zone between this value and the 6.5% cut point for diabetes. Values herein are not quite normal and yet not high enough to qualify as diabetes. This will predictably create the same confusion that may have arisen in individuals in the categories of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance using the current guidelines. Moreover, the sensitivity of the A1C test in this specific range may be less than optimal. (In this context, it is also very important to recognize that point-of-care testing is not recommended; the standardized assay, which makes the new recommendations feasible, is only available through a clinical laboratory.)

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115nF8Gf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening and monitoring — tests and frequency are outlined as follows: Complications generally become prevalent when estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (stage G3 CKD or greater). Evaluation of elevated blood pressure and volume overload should occur at every clinical contact possible; laboratory evaluations are generally indicated every 6–12 months for stage G3 CKD, every 3–5 months for stage G4 CKD, and every 1–3 months for stage G5 CKD. The table lists "Blood pressure > 130/80 mmHg" with evaluation by "Blood pressure, weight, BMI", and includes laboratory assessments for electrolyte abnormalities (serum electrolytes), anemia (hemoglobin; iron, iron saturation, ferritin testing if indicated), and metabolic bone disease (serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin 25(OH)D).

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^116mfAx6]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary erythrocytosis refers to an elevation in hemoglobin or hematocrit in response to elevated serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, rather than intrinsic dysfunction of the bone marrow. The most common cause of secondary erythrocytosis is chronic hypoxia, which can result from conditions such as hypoxic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, smoking, and cyanotic heart disease. Other secondary causes include EPO-secreting tumors and posttransplantation erythrocytosis.

Medications are an increasingly recognized cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Testosterone has been well established in the literature to cause an elevation in hemoglobin and hematocrit. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have also been identified as a cause of drug-induced erythrocytosis.,

Current guidelines on the diagnosis and management of secondary erythrocytosis are limited. In 2005, the British Society of Haematology published guidelineson the investigation and management of erythrocytosis, with a subsequent amendmentin 2007 to include JAK2 mutation testing due to its role in polycythemia vera, a primary cause of erythrocytosis. These guidelines recommended a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral film, JAK2 mutation testing, and other investigations to identify primary vs secondary causes. More recently, these guidelines were updated to provide recommendations for the management of several secondary causes of erythrocytosis; however, drug-induced erythrocytosis was not addressed.

Although guidelines for the management of drug-induced erythrocytosis related to testosterone are available, there is variability in the definition of erythrocytosis and recommendations. The 2018 American Urological Association guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone if hematocrit exceeds 50% to investigate for an etiology and reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing testosterone for hematocrit ≥ 54%. In comparison, the 2018 Endocrine Society guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone for hematocrit > 54% until hematocrit normalizes, then resuming therapy at a lower dose; they also included therapeutic phlebotomy as an effective management strategy. Evidence to support specific hematocrit thresholds is lacking, and considerable uncertainty remains surrounding optimal management. Moreover, existing guidelines do not include suggestions on diagnostic investigations for other secondary causes of erythrocytosis and do not mention the role of cytoreductive therapy, antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulation. Furthermore, since the publication of these guidelines, new drugs associated with erythrocytosis have emerged, namely SGLT-2 inhibitors.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^116S1vvd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease hemoglobin target — measuring performance: In general, a Hb target range suggests that ESA dose adjustment decisions are made by comparing the patient's achieved Hb with the selected Hb target, and the result of a single sampling in a single patient cannot be expected to lie within a narrow Hb target range (eg, Hb of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL) or to equal a discrete point Hb target (eg, Hb of either 11.0, 11.5, or 12.0 g/dL). However, mean or median Hb levels of a group of patients or mean Hb levels of a single patient repeated over time would be expected to lie within a Hb target range or to approximate a discrete Hb target, and measures of clinical performance, to be clinically useful, must account for a high degree of within-patient and between-patient variability.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: when results may be misleading [^114dkPgY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### Current controversies in the use of haemoglobin A1c [^115RTvpq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) has recently been adopted by the World Health Organization into its recommended criteria for diabetes diagnosis. Much debate continues regarding the relative benefits and potential disadvantages surrounding the use of HbA(1c) for this purpose. There is a lack of consensus as to whether this alteration to the definition of diabetes is a step forward or whether it could add further confusion and ambiguity to the debate on the method and criteria for the diagnosis of this globally important disease. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current issues surrounding how HbA(1c) is measured and reported; and of the evidence for and against its use in diagnosis.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for methemoglobinemia, more specifically with respect to methemoglobin levels, EHA/ERN-EuroBloodNet 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- key symptoms of methemoglobinemia are related to the methemoglobin levels

- methemoglobin levels in inherited conditions range between 10–30% accounting for the occurrence of cyanosis and dark brown blood as the main signs

- patients are generally asymptomatic or may present with headaches, tachycardia, and mild dyspnea at these levels (10–30%) of methemoglobin.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^116BUCJX]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The experts panel reached 95.5% (21/22) of consensus on this recommendation (Figure 1).

Q3. What is the diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis of congenital and acquired forms of methemoglobinemia? What are the functional and molecular tests to be performed in cases of new variants where diagnosis is reached through NGS?

Although it is of importance to establish a hereditary cause for methemoglobinemia, the distinction between acquired and inherited causes is not required for treatment of the acute patient and, hence, treatment should be initiated while the cause is being investigated.
The key tests in the differential diagnosis of methemoglobinemia are the measurement of MetHb levels using blood gas measurement by co‐oximetry, the measurement of cytochrome b5 reductase enzymatic activity, and DNA analysis. CYB5R enzymatic activity, previously called methemoglobin reductase or methemoglobin diaphorase, is generally measured using ferricyanide as a substrate and oxidation of NADH at 340 nm according to the following reaction:

Elevated MetHb may also occur in patients with unstable hemoglobins and other hemolytic anemias, such as G6PD deficiency. In these patients, hemolysis is the main sign and symptom and methemoglobinemia may appear after exposure to oxidant drugs. Heinz body formation may be observed at peripheral blood examination. Isopropanol or heat stability testing is usually altered in these cases and may be useful in the differential diagnosis. When suspecting a Hb‐variant, the most efficient approach to the diagnosis is targeted sequencing of the globin genes.
With the advent of NGS technologies the causative genes of hereditary methemoglobinemia are usually included in targeted NGS panels and the identification of pathogenic variants enables either the confirmation or exclusion of inherited and acquired forms or methemoglobinemia. In case new variants are identified in CYB5R3, the enzyme activity assay described above can be used to assess their pathogenicity.

(Recommendations) Cytochrome b5 reductase activity measurement is the gold standard test to discriminate hereditary CYB5R3 deficiency from acquired methemoglobinemia. Molecular testing can be considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of hereditary methemoglobinemia.

The experts panel reached 90.9% (20/22) of consensus on this recommendation (Figure 1).

Q4. What is the clinical management of methemoglobinemia in neonatal/childhood period and the therapeutic approach?

### Normal physiologic carboxyhemoglobinemia of neonate masquerading as carbon monoxide poisoning [^111NmYp2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide toxicity is a common concern in emergency departments. This case report describes a neonate with a falsely elevated carboxyhemoglobin level, initially raising concern for carbon monoxide exposure. The neonate was transferred to a tertiary care hospital and admitted, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy considered. Ultimately, it was determined that actual carbon monoxide exposure was unlikely, and the elevated carboxyhemoglobin was attributed to natural breakdown of fetal hemoglobin by heme oxidase. This case highlights the importance of considering this physiological phenomenon when evaluating elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels in neonates. Recognizing this led to the deferral of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, reducing unnecessary resource utilization and preventing undue stress for the family.

At this time, HRIs with cysts in the setting of elevated HbA1c should continue surveillance under published guidelines. In newly established guidelines, there was expert consensus around the need for glucose testing (fasting glucose or HbA1c) to detect new-onset diabetes in HRIs. Additionally, there was consensus that the new emergence of diabetes in HRIs should prompt additional investigation. Further prospective surveillance data are required to evaluate risk factors for neoplastic progression in HRIs with cysts and elevated HbA1c.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11798zui]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^114TKnq9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of PROCRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the PROCRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue PROCRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate PROCRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT, and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

### Diagnostic workup of microcytic anemia: an evaluation of underuse or misuse of laboratory testing in a hospital setting using the alinIQ system [^114hzc6K]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context —

Underuse of laboratory testing has been previously investigated in preselected populations, such as documented malpractice claims. However, these numbers might not reflect real-life situations.

Objective —

To evaluate the underuse and misuse of laboratory follow-up testing in a real-life hospital patient population with microcytic anemia, using laboratory results ordered during routine patient care.

Design —

From all patients in whom a microcytic anemia was detected during routine diagnostics in 2018, all available laboratory data were collected and screened for appropriateness of diagnostic workup of iron deficiency and thalassemia. Subgroup analysis was performed for patient groups with mean corpuscular volume values 75 to 79 μm3 (group 1), 65 to 74 μm3 (group 2), and < 65 μm3 (group 3).

Results —

A total of 2244 patients with microcytic anemia were identified. Follow-up testing for iron deficiency was not performed in 761 cases (34%). For inconclusive ferritin levels due to elevated C-reactive protein results (n = 336), reticulocyte hemoglobin content or soluble transferrin receptor levels were missing in 86 cases (26%). In patients with suspected thalassemia (n = 127), follow-up testing for hemoglobin variants was not performed in 70 cases (55%). Subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of underuse of iron status as well as thalassemia/hemoglobinopathy testing decreased from group 1 to group 3. When considering relevant preexisting anemia diagnoses, laboratory tests were underused in 904 cases (40.3%).

Conclusions —

Because 40% (n = 904) of the patients with microcytic anemia were potentially not followed up correctly, laboratory specialists are advised to act by implementing demand management strategies in collaboration with clinicians to overcome underuse of laboratory tests and to improve patient safety.

### Inflammatory biomarkers to detect immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated cardiotoxicity in lung cancer patients: ready for prime time? [^115XxxEx]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The second issue is the lack of adjustments for confounders and the need for a multivariable analysis. The authors were interested in evaluating commonly obtained inflammatory markers as diagnostic tools for identifying and monitoring irAEs. In the present study, NLR and CRP levels were retrospectively evaluated at baseline and at the time of MACE. Although these assays are routinely available and inexpensive, elevations in NLR and CRP were not demonstrated to be specific to cardiovascular irAEs. Univariable analysis showed that baseline NLR was indeed statistically different among patients with MACE compared to patients without MACE. However, most baseline laboratory values, including hemoglobin, white blood cell counts, platelets, and creatinine levels were also significantly different between the 2 groups. By not adjusting for potential confounders, including any hematological markers, the specificity of baseline NLR in predicting ICI-associated irAE is unclear. Indeed, for NLR or CRP to emerge as important biomarkers, a multivariable analysis would be a more appropriate approach. This is especially relevant in this cohort where the use of higher doses of steroid in the MACE group (78% vs. 35%, respectively; p < 0.001) could be the primary driver of neutrophil demargination and elevated NLR. The authors admit that CRP has been previously shown to be elevated in their population presenting with ICI-related pneumonitis, and NLR was elevated in patients that developed noncardiac irAEs. Thus, the search for a specific biomarker indicative of cardiac irAEs continues and likely requires a prospective clinical trial.

In summary, the characterization of cardiovascular toxicity among lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy represents an important contribution to the field of cardio-oncology. As the indications for immunotherapy continue to expand, the need to understand the risk factors for the development of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular toxicities arising from immunotherapy is imperative. Although inflammatory biomarkers may be associated with the development of MACE, it remains to be determined whether these markers are specific enough to change life-prolonging immunotherapy treatment strategies.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: a measured response to a critical review [^112rbFJc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

KEY TENETS IN THE ROLE AND EVALUATION OF SpHb MONITORING

Sp 2 monitoring by pulse oximetry offers lessons for the new technology of SpHb monitoring through Pulse CO-Oximetry. Like Sp 2, SpHb monitoring provides continuous, real-time information. Also like pulse oximetry, the largest benefits of SpHb monitoring come from providing continuous Hb values to indicate reassurance or an unexpected status change, rather than from replacing lab-Hb. As a randomized controlled trial, a prospective cohort study, and case studies have shown us (refs. shown below), SpHb monitoring will help optimize transfusion decisions and aid in the detection of occult bleeding. In the pursuit of these high-impact benefits, when evaluating SpHb monitoring clinicians should consider the following tenets:

1. The value of SpHb monitoring should not be based on the premise that it replaces lab-Hb.

Because lab-Hb has been traditionally used as the main indicator for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, a simplistic view of the purpose of SpHb monitoring would be as a replacement of lab-Hb, where the clinician must choose to measure either lab-Hb or SpHb. However, this perspective offers a false choice. Although some clinicians may wish to use SpHb to replace lab-Hb, continuous SpHb derives its primary clinical (and financial) value from continuous, real-time measurement and trending. Instead of replacement, the true value of SpHb monitoring is as a supplement to lab-Hb by providing real-time visibility of hemoglobin changes, or lack thereof, in the periods between invasive blood sampling and lab-Hb analysis.

As discussed in Subsection 4, Trend Accuracy, below and based on the described studies on trending accuracy of SpHb versus sporadic laboratory Hb measurements, SpHb monitoring can help clinicians: (a) detect decreasing Hb when it is assumed to be stable; (b) identify stable Hb values when they are assumed to be decreasing; and (c) identify increases in Hb when they are assumed not to be increasing. Thus, a downward SpHb trend may alert clinicians to order a blood sample sooner than they would otherwise have done, thus facilitating an earlier needed RBC transfusion or other intervention. Likewise, a stable or increasing SpHb trend, together with other aspects of the patient assessment, can prevent an unnecessary RBC transfusion from occurring.

KDOQI 2007 update — hemoglobin (Hb) targets for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy state that "the selected Hb target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL"; the guideline distinguishes Hb targets from achieved Hb levels and notes it "appraised only evidence that was generated from intent-to-treat analyses of trials in patients randomly assigned to either higher or lower Hb targets". The document also states that "Assignment to Hb targets greater than 13 g/dL decreases, but does not eliminate, transfusions in hemodialysis patients", and cites "evidence from RCTs suggesting that assignment to Hb targets greater than 13.0 g/dL may increase the risk of life-threatening adverse events".

### Technical considerations and avoiding complications in total hip arthroplasty [^112QZBci]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative Assessment

Preoperative screening and preoperative optimization increase the chance of a successful surgery. Implementing standardized preoperative optimization protocols reduces 90-day cost of care to patients. Medical clearance from a primary care provider and any needed specialists reduces the risk of postoperative complications such as surgical site infections (SSIs), reduced length of stays, and rehospitalizations. Treating underlying malnutrition, attaining a hemoglobin A1c of less than 7.5%, treating anemia, and smoking cessation all can decrease length of stay, readmission, and total cost of care to each patients. Research has indicated that elevated hemoglobin A1c levels and hyperglycemia can predispose patients to prosthetic joint infections, with A1c levels more than 7.5 causing marked increases in the risk of these infections. Patients with controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c < 7.5%) have similar rates of complications as those without diabetes. Follow-up and re-evaluation is needed to ensure that these modifiable risk factors are being treated appropriately.

Technical preparation is important to avoid complications and provide a plan to restore leg lengths and offset as well as implant positioning. A thorough history and physical examination with radiographic templating (Figure 1) allows the surgeon to plan for unique aspects of the upcoming procedure. Planning for implant removal, deformity correction, the surgical approach, and ensuring the correct implants are available can be done before surgery to decrease surgical time and provide the most appropriate implant for the patient. An increase in surgical time can increase infection risk on an incremental basis. This imaging (Figure 1) allows the surgeon to assess leg lengths, offset, the quality of bone stock and morphology of the acetabulum, and the likely positioning of the implants and can usually predict the implant size within 1 to 2 increments.

Figure 1
Template AP pelvic radiograph shows superior migration of the femoral head in (A), and the template in (B) shows the plan to restore the leg length and offset.

Preventing three common indications for revision arthroplasty (dislocation, aseptic loosening, and adverse local tissue reactions [ATLRs]) takes place preoperatively with templating, selecting appropriately sized implants, optimizing leg length and offset, and choosing appropriate bearing surfaces.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^111nHquB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease hemoglobin target — ESA dosing and achieved Hb relative to targets: 10% to 16% dose changes can be an effective maintenance dose-titration strategy; holding ESA doses may lead to steep downward Hb excursions and high amplitude Hb cycling; imposing a fixed 25% dose decrease in response to greater-than-target Hb levels appears to promote greater Hb variability and more greater-than-target Hb values. In practice, when the target Hb is 11 g/dL or greater or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achievement of Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range is associated with lower mortality and less frequent hospitalization rates compared with achievement of lower Hb levels, and the same inverse relationship was seen in RCTs within assigned treatment arms (including arms with targets ≥ 13 g/dL); however, failure to show between-group benefits confirms that the relationship is not causal. The results are consistent with the conclusion that when the target Hb is greater than 11.0 g/dL or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achieved Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range do not constitute increased risk to patients; in general, higher facility- and country-specific achieved mean Hb and a lower percentage below target are associated with increased ESA use, and adjustment for ESA dose administered does not diminish the relationship between baseline Hb and mortality or hospitalization risk.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^11797uxd]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy — MSAFP evaluation and aneuploidy/genetic carrier screening: We advise that pregnant patients with an unexplained elevation of MSAFP be evaluated and counseled by an advanced prenatal care qualified obstetric provider because of the increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, and if cfDNA testing is chosen for aneuploidy screening and MSAFP testing is desired, providers should not order serum screening (e.g., quad screen) with MSAFP because additional aneuploidy screening increases the risk of false positives and inconsistent lab results with no additional benefit. In contrast to aneuploidy screening and MSAFP, genetic testing (e.g., parental carrier testing) can be done before or during pregnancy without need to repeat in a future pregnancy; these genetic tests include hemoglobin electrophoresis (to screen for hemoglobinopathies), carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which should be offered to all patients. Fragile X carrier screening should be offered to patients at increased risk of the condition based on personal or family history of fragile X–related disorders (e.g., premature ovarian insufficiency, elevated follicle stimulating hormone level before age 40, a known FMR1 premutation, family history of intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome), and a more comprehensive carrier screen panel may be considered for patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria — polycythemia vera (PV): The diagnosis of PV requires either all 3 major criteria or the first 2 major criteria plus the minor criterion. Major criteria are elevated hemoglobin concentration (> 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women) or elevated hematocrit (> 49% in men, > 48% in women); bone marrow biopsy showing age-adjusted hypercellularity with trilineage proliferation (panmyelosis), including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (differences in size); and presence of JAK2 p.V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion is subnormal serum erythropoietin level. Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be required in patients with sustained absolute erythrocytosis (hemoglobin concentrations of > 18.5 g/dL in men or > 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit values of > 55.5% in men or > 49.5% in women) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation, a higher hematocrit target (eg, 52%) could be considered in men before further investigation is required.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### Maintaining control over haemoglobin levels: optimizing the management of anaemia in chronic kidney disease [^115VTpZ8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents radically advanced the management of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The European Best Practice Guidelines recommend that most patients with CKD achieve a target haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 11 g/dl to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The optimal upper Hb level has not been determined and will likely vary among CKD patient populations. Recently reported studies show evidence that normalising Hb (approximately 14 g/dl) in CKD may increase the risk of adverse events and puts attention to the importance of the upper Hb target. Most patients can achieve target Hb levels with proper treatment. However, recent studies have demonstrated that while average Hb levels may fall within desired targets, the Hb levels of many patients are not being adequately controlled, i.e. their Hb levels are not consistently maintained within a specified target range over time. Furthermore, data indicate that failing to control Hb levels over time may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. This review will discuss the challenges in controlling Hb in the CKD patient population, particularly in haemodialysis patients. Factors that affect Hb control over time will be considered, as well as the clinical criteria for its assessment. Although challenging, control of Hb is manageable and has potential clinical benefits.
