## Question

Can gallstones cause isolated hyperbilirubinemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gallstones can cause isolated hyperbilirubinemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "isolated hyperbilirubinemia" means clinically and how to fractionate bilirubin. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of gallstone-related biliary obstruction and its typical biochemical pattern. Next, I will review guideline and observational data on how often bilirubin is elevated without other liver test abnormalities in choledocholithiasis. After that, I should consider exceptions, including transient or partial obstruction and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline the diagnostic approach if isolated hyperbilirubinemia is encountered.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misinterpret the question. "Isolated hyperbilirubinemia" generally means an elevation of total bilirubin with normal alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and it requires fractionation into direct and indirect components to localize the mechanism, because conjugated hyperbilirubinemia points toward hepatocellular disease or cholestasis, whereas unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia points toward overproduction or impaired conjugation.

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology of gallstone-related jaundice. When a gallstone obstructs the common bile duct, the resulting cholestasis typically produces a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is accompanied by cholestatic enzyme elevations, particularly alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and often by transaminase elevations as well, reflecting biliary epithelial injury and cholangitis risk. This pattern is well described in reviews and guidelines on obstructive jaundice and choledocholithiasis [^964a73ce] [^6ec78c1e] [^79d21570].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify how often bilirubin is truly isolated in choledocholithiasis. Observational and guideline data consistently show that bilirubin alone is an unreliable predictor of common bile duct stones, with low specificity and modest sensitivity; for example, in acute calculous cholecystitis, normal liver tests are common even when stones are present, and conversely, abnormal bilirubin can occur without choledocholithiasis due to inflammation, so relying on bilirubin in isolation risks both false positives and false negatives [^37f5de0d] [^9b0951bf] [^92a8fe62]. A Cochrane review of ultrasound versus liver function tests also highlights that bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, while sometimes sensitive, have imperfect specificity and should not be used in isolation to diagnose common bile duct stones [^c9bb5180].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are credible scenarios where bilirubin might appear "isolated". Transient or partial obstruction can cause fluctuating bilirubin elevations with minimal or transient enzyme changes, and small stones or sludge may pass without sustained enzyme abnormalities. In such cases, bilirubin could be the only abnormality captured at a single time point, though this is uncommon and often reflects sampling or timing rather than a true isolated process [^25478071] [^92a8fe62]. I should also consider special populations: in chronic hemolytic states like sickle cell disease, baseline unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from hemolysis can mask or complicate the interpretation of cholestatic patterns, and pigment stones themselves reflect bilirubin precipitation, so "isolated" bilirubin in that context may reflect the underlying hemolysis rather than a pure obstructive mechanism [^9e190ff9] [^31a31b44].

> I will now examine the diagnostic implications so I don't overstate certainty. Guidelines emphasize that bilirubin should be interpreted alongside alkaline phosphatase, GGT, transaminases, and imaging, and that no single laboratory value establishes choledocholithiasis; ultrasound, MRCP, or EUS are needed to confirm stones, and bilirubin thresholds such as greater than 4 mg/dL are used in combination with ductal dilation or imaging findings to stratify risk, not as standalone diagnostic criteria [^1c22f05c] [^79d21570] [^acd69367]. Let me reconsider: if bilirubin is elevated and enzymes are normal, I should double-check for hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome, or other causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia before attributing it to gallstone disease, because isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia is not explained by biliary obstruction [^6a130be4].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Gallstones can cause hyperbilirubinemia, but isolated hyperbilirubinemia — defined as elevated bilirubin with normal ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT — is not the typical or expected biochemical signature of choledocholithiasis; when it occurs, it is uncommon, often reflects transient or partial obstruction, sampling variability, or coexisting conditions like hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome, and should prompt careful fractionation of bilirubin and targeted imaging rather than reflexive attribution to gallstones alone [^964a73ce] [^37f5de0d] [^6a130be4].

---

Gallstones can cause **isolated hyperbilirubinemia** when they transiently obstruct the common bile duct, producing a **predominantly conjugated** elevation with normal liver enzymes. This pattern is most often due to small stones or sludge that cause partial or intermittent obstruction, allowing bilirubin to rise without significant enzyme leakage. Persistent or complete obstruction typically raises bilirubin alongside alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and sometimes transaminases, so isolated hyperbilirubinemia is uncommon and should prompt careful evaluation for intermittent obstruction, hemolysis, or genetic causes like Gilbert syndrome [^6a130be4] [^25478071].

---

## Pathophysiology of hyperbilirubinemia in gallstone disease

Hyperbilirubinemia arises from **impaired bile flow** or increased bilirubin production. Gallstones cause hyperbilirubinemia mainly by obstructing the bile ducts, which reduces bile excretion and leads to conjugated (direct) bilirubin accumulation [^964a73ce]. Obstruction can be **complete or partial**, and its duration and severity determine the biochemical pattern.

---

## Clinical evidence of isolated hyperbilirubinemia in gallstone disease

Although gallstone obstruction typically causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with elevated cholestatic enzymes (ALP, GGT), **isolated hyperbilirubinemia** — with normal ALP, GGT, AST, and ALT — can occur in specific scenarios:

- **Transient obstruction**: Small stones or sludge may cause intermittent obstruction, leading to transient rises in bilirubin without sustained enzyme elevation [^notfound].

- **Partial obstruction**: Partial bile duct obstruction can elevate bilirubin with minimal enzyme leakage, especially early or intermittently [^notfound].

- **Mirizzi syndrome**: Impaction of a gallstone at the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch can compress the common bile duct, causing obstruction and jaundice with variable enzyme changes [^f4e20c0c].

## Diagnostic evaluation of isolated hyperbilirubinemia in gallstone disease

When isolated hyperbilirubinemia is suspected in gallstone disease, a **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Fractionated bilirubin (direct and indirect) | Determine conjugated vs unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^6a130be4] |
| 2 | Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) | Assess hepatocellular and cholestatic injury [^376f0048] |
| 3 | Complete blood count (CBC) | Evaluate for hemolysis or infection [^aead04fd] |
| 4 | Abdominal ultrasound | Detect gallstones, ductal dilation, or obstruction [^79d21570] |
| 5 | Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | Confirm choledocholithiasis or subtle obstruction if ultrasound is inconclusive [^79d21570] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Isolated hyperbilirubinemia in gallstone disease is **clinically significant** because it may signal early or intermittent obstruction that can progress to complete blockage, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Management depends on severity and risk:

- **Observation**: Asymptomatic or mild cases with low-risk features may be monitored with serial labs and imaging [^notfound].

- **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Definitive diagnosis and treatment for confirmed choledocholithiasis or persistent obstruction [^1c22f05c].

- **Cholecystectomy**: Recommended for symptomatic gallstone disease or complications to prevent recurrence [^95fa3d19].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can confound the interpretation of isolated hyperbilirubinemia in gallstone disease:

- **Hemolysis**: Can cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, mimicking or compounding gallstone-related jaundice [^6a130be4].

- **Gilbert syndrome**: Mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that can coexist with gallstone disease [^6a130be4].

- **Medications**: Certain drugs can elevate bilirubin or alter liver enzyme profiles [^964a73ce].

---

Gallstones can cause **isolated hyperbilirubinemia**, typically conjugated, when obstruction is transient or partial. This is uncommon and warrants a structured evaluation to confirm gallstone-related obstruction and exclude other causes.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^ef2bfd1f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

### Lack of an association between gallstone disease and bilirubin levels with risk of colorectal cancer: a mendelian randomisation analysis [^8234064c]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gallstone disease has been proposed to increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, evidence for a causal relationship from epidemiological studies is lacking. The observational nature of studies has made them vulnerable to confounding, from measured and unmeasured risk factors and reverse causation. It is especially noteworthy that many of the risk factors for gallstone disease include factors that are well-established as risk factors for CRC (obesity, high energy intake, alcohol consumption and diabetes). Increased production of bilirubin, the metabolic by-product of haemoglobin degradation, is also associated with gallstone disease. – This is intriguing as bilirubin has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory attributes, with experimental studies reporting mildly elevated levels being associated with decreased oxidative stress-related disease, including cancer. –

Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an analytic methodology in which germline genetic variants are used as proxies, or instrumental variables (IVs), for putative risk factors. We assume that these genetic variants follow Mendel's laws of inheritance, where the variants are randomly assorted at conception and are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with one another. These genetic variants are not influenced by reverse causation. The variants can also provide unconfounded estimates of disease risk, provided they do not directly influence the disease without complete mediation of the risk factor and are not associated with confounders of the relationship between risk factor and disease. – Confounding can, however, be introduced to MR by population stratification, assortative mating and dynastic effects.

To address the shortcomings of conventional observational epidemiological studies, we investigated whether genetic liability to gallstone disease and circulating levels of bilirubin are causally associated with CRC using MR. Specifically, we used two-sample MR, in which genetic variants associated with relevant risk factors as instrumental variables were first identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We then assessed the association between these instrumental variables and CRC in a large GWAS.

### Extreme bilirubin levels as a causal risk factor for symptomatic gallstone disease [^bbfaa24d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

In individuals without blockage of their bile ducts, levels of plasma bilirubin likely reflect levels of biliary bilirubin; higher biliary bilirubin levels may increase the risk of gallstone disease.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that a lifelong increase in plasma bilirubin levels is a causal risk factor for symptomatic gallstone disease in the general population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a prospective study of the Danish general population (N = 61,212), we first tested whether elevated levels of plasma bilirubin predicted greater risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. Second, taking advantage of mendelian randomization, we tested whether a genetic variant in the bilirubin glucoronidating enzyme UGT1A1 (rs6742078) was associated with increased plasma bilirubin levels and, in turn, with an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Plasma bilirubin level and symptomatic gallstone disease.

Results

During 34 years of follow-up, 3374 individuals developed symptomatic gallstone disease. In adjusted analyses, persons with plasma bilirubin levels in the 10th decile had a greater risk of symptomatic gallstone disease compared with those with plasma bilirubin levels in deciles 1 through 9; the hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) were 1.57 (1.26–1.96) overall, 1.36 (1.02–1.82) in women, and 2.00 (1.41–2.83) in men. UGT1A1 genotype explained 20% of the total variation in plasma bilirubin levels and was associated with increases in the mean plasma bilirubin level overall of +16% (+0.09 mg/dL) in GT heterozygotes and +90% (+0.50 mg/dL) in TT homozygotes compared with GG homozygotes, with similar effects in women and men (P for trend < .001 for all). The corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for symptomatic gallstone disease were 1.09 (1.02–1.17) for GT heterozygotes and 1.22 (1.09–1.36) for TT homozygotes vs GG homozygotes and similar in women and men (P for trend = .04- < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

These results are compatible with a causal association between extreme levels of plasma bilirubin and increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.

### Gallstones [^6ec78c1e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Gallstones grow inside the gallbladder or biliary tract. These stones can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; only gallstones with symptoms or complications are defined as gallstone disease. Based on their composition, gallstones are classified into cholesterol gallstones, which represent the predominant entity, and bilirubin ('pigment') stones. Black pigment stones can be caused by chronic haemolysis; brown pigment stones typically develop in obstructed and infected bile ducts. For treatment, localization of the gallstones in the biliary tract is more relevant than composition. Overall, up to 20% of adults develop gallstones and > 20% of those develop symptoms or complications. Risk factors for gallstones are female sex, age, pregnancy, physical inactivity, obesity and overnutrition. Factors involved in metabolic syndrome increase the risk of developing gallstones and form the basis of primary prevention by lifestyle changes. Common mutations in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 confer most of the genetic risk of developing gallstones, which accounts for ∼25% of the total risk. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasonography and liver biochemistry tests. Symptoms often precede the onset of the three common and potentially life-threatening complications of gallstones (acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis). Although our knowledge on the genetics and pathophysiology of gallstones has expanded recently, current treatment algorithms remain predominantly invasive and are based on surgery. Hence, our future efforts should focus on novel preventive strategies to overcome the onset of gallstones in at-risk patients in particular, but also in the population in general.

### Bilirubin and gallstone disease… [^d8161986]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Design, Setting, and Participants In a prospective study of the Danish general population, we first tested whether elevated levels of plasma bilirubin predicted greater risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. Second, taking advantage of mendelian randomization, we tested whether a genetic variant in the bilirubin glucoronidating enzyme UGT1A1 was associated with increased plasma bilirubin levels and, in turn, with an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. Conclusions and Relevance These results are compatible with a causal association between extreme levels of plasma bilirubin and increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. For details on covariates, laboratory measurements, and genotyping, see the eMethods and the eTable in the Supplement.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between elevated levels of plasma bilirubin and prospective risk of symptomatic gallstone disease in the general population and the first to use a mendelian randomization approach in this context. The main findings of this study are that both observationally and genetically elevated levels of plasma bilirubin are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. These results are compatible with a causal association between elevated levels of plasma bilirubin per se and increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. However, both observational and genetic estimates were attenuated among women compared with men in our study. In the observational analyses, only extreme levels of plasma bilirubin in the 10th decile were associated with an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease, suggesting a threshold effect of elevated biliary bilirubin level on risk of gallstones.

We suggest that extreme levels of plasma total bilirubin, in individuals without cholestasis, mainly reflects increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin has been suggested to be more prone to precipitate in the bile compared with conjugated bilirubin2 and, therefore, may more readily cause gallstone disease. It is possible that elevated biliary bilirubin level increases the number of nucleation cores, thus promoting the formation of numerous smaller gallstones. 9 In support of this hypothesis, Buch et al9 found that rs6742078 was more strongly associated with symptomatic than with asymptomatic gallstones. In conclusion, both observationally and genetically elevated levels of plasma bilirubin are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to do not rely solely on elevated LFTs or bilirubin for identifying common bile duct stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, rather obtain further diagnostic tests.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^86f8b0a8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, we conducted phenome-wide colocalization analyses between neonatal jaundice and adult bilirubin levels and 952 phenotypes from the PAN UK Biobank (using only summary statistics derived from individuals of European ancestries) at the UGT genes region (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Data 6). Overall, we observed that only a small number of phenotypes colocalized with either neonatal jaundice or adult bilirubin levels (n = 5, 6 for neonatal jaundice and adult bilirubin levels, respectively). Total cholesterol levels colocalized with both neonatal jaundice and adult bilirubin levels, due to two conditionally independent lead SNPs associated with total cholesterol levels in the region. This result is in line with the negative correlation observed between bilirubin levels and lower total cholesterol levels, but this association was not replicated in a Mendelian randomization analysis. We further observed high probability of colocalization (posterior probability > 0.9) between neonatal jaundice and a number of lipid-related traits, and between adult bilirubin levels and phenotypes related to gallstones (i.e. cholelithiasis), which can be caused by excess of bilirubin levels.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^d1ad438d]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^49986f36]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

When the guidelines are used to identify individuals at high risk for CBDS for upfront ERCP, the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines are more specific with pooled specificities of 75% and 82%, respectively, compared to a specificity of 57% only with the ASGE 2010 guidelines. The lower specificities of ASGE guidelines probably reflect the inclusion of elevated bilirubin as a high‐risk criterion, when bilirubin in isolation had been found to be an unreliable predictor for CBDS on meta‐analysis. This is particularly relevant with ASGE 2010 guidelines, where a lesser degree of bilirubin elevation is considered high risk if the bile duct is also dilated. In use, the higher specificities of ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines translate to lower false positive rates of CBDS and therefore lower rates of nontherapeutic ERCP; however, this still amounts to 18% even with the most selective ESGE criteria, which comprise only of CBDS on ultrasound and acute cholangitis. In their meta‐analysis, Wang et al. found that CBDS on ultrasound is highly predictive for CBDS with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.6 and an average specificity of 94%, but acute cholangitis is much less predictive with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.3 and an average specificity of 89%. We hypothesize that the modest specificity of the guidelines is probably partly due to the inclusion of acute cholangitis as a criterion, which is variably and perhaps less objectively diagnosed on clinical grounds. In terms of sensitivities, all guidelines perform comparably but only modestly with pooled sensitivities of 62%–65%, resulting in over 30% of patients with CBDS misclassified as nonhigh risk. This is however of less clinical import because these individuals are likely to undergo further evaluation with MRCP or EUS with similar eventual outcomes, albeit at the price of additional costs and possible delays to definitive treatment.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^aead04fd]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Association between dietary potassium intake and the prevalence of gallstones in American adults: an assessment of data from the national health and nutrition examination survey [^627cb3ae]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones typically develop within the gallbladder or bile ducts. They are categorized into three primary types: cholesterol stones, bilirubin stones, and mixed stones. Among these, cholesterol stonesand those are classified as mixed stones. Gallstones, which may present as either asymptomatic or symptomatic, are chemically classified into two main types: common cholesterol stones and bilirubin (pigment) stones. Black pigment stones are associated with chronic hemolysis, while brown pigment stones are linked to obstructed or infected bile ducts. The majority of gallstones (80–90%) that form in the gallbladder primarily consist of cholesterol (70%), embedded within a matrix of bile pigments, calcium salts, and glycoproteins. In addition to pure and mixed cholesterol stones, pure pigment stones are also identified. Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (bacterial and helminthic deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides) and are more prevalent in Asia. Black pigment stones, which mainly consist of calcium bilirubinate, are found in conditions such as hemolytic anemia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and in patients with cystic fibrosis. The increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin is believed to be the cause of black pigment stones, a phenomenon also observed in patients with ileal dysfunction, consistent with the finding of elevated bilirubin levels in bile in patients with active ileal Crohn's disease or following ileal resection. However, in patients with bile salt malabsorption, other factors leading to biliary cholesterol supersaturation may more likely promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Gallstones are a prevalent condition, with particularly high incidences rates among American Indians, where the prevalence can reach up to 60–70%. In contrast, among White adults in developed countries, the prevalence ranges from 10 to 15%. Gallstones pose a substantial burden on healthcare systems, a challenge anticipated to escalate with an aging and high-risk population. In the United States (US), gallstone disease is the most frequently diagnosed hospitalized condition among gastrointestinal and liver diseases. The majority of individuals with gallstones remain asymptomatic throughout their lives, yet approximately 10 percent of patients will eventually develop symptoms. Complications associated with gallstones, such as cholecystitis, acute suppurative cholangitis, and pancreatitis, impact between 20 and 40% of individuals diagnosed with gallstones. However, approximately 1–2% of these patients experience complications necessitating surgical intervention annually. Furthermore, the presence of gallstones elevates the risk of gallbladder cancer(GBC), a condition typically associated with a poor prognosis. GBC is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, representing 80–95% of biliary tract cancers worldwide. Although relatively uncommon, it ranks sixth among all gastrointestinal malignancies. In 2019, an estimated 12,360 new cases were diagnosed, and 3,960 patients died from GBC and other biliary cancer in the United States. Because of the insidious onset, rapid progression, and early asymptomatic characteristics of GBC, diagnosis is usually not made until intraoperative and postoperative pathological examinations, when the disease is already in moderate and advanced stages, and the therapeutic effect are poor. Indeed, the overall mean survival rate for patients with gallbladder cancer is 6 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. Gallstones have traditionally been regarded as an etiological factor for gallbladder cancer according to case–control studies or autopsy studies. Most patients with gallbladder cancer have gallstones, and gallbladder cancer rates are well correlated with the prevalence of gallstones disease. In support of this association, an inverse correlation between cholecystectomy for gallstones and gallbladder cancer rates has been described. Convincing evidence also exists for the presence of gallstones as a strongly associated factor for gallbladder cancer etiology. It incurs direct costs amounting to $6.5 billion, and the associated expenditures have been escalating rapidly. Consequently, the identification of reliable and well-controlled clinical indicators is crucial for predicting or preventing the development of gallstones.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^32ed7e7a]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are solid rounded particles composed of a combination of cholesterol and bilirubin that form within the gallbladder and within the biliary system. The size and number of gallstones is variable with some patients forming multiple small gallstones and others forming single or few large stones.

The incidence of gallstones is increasing in Western populations as obesity levels rise. In the USA, 8.6% of Caucasian men and 16.6% of women have gallstones. The vast majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and require no follow-up; however, approximately 10–15% of gallstones will become symptomatic over a period of 10–15 years of follow-up. The symptomatic manifestations of gallstones are variable and range from mild symptoms such as biliary colic to severe acute presentations such as pancreatitis, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a patient that has suffered a symptomatic manifestation of gallstones, the incidence of a further manifestation over their lifetime is approximately 3% per year. The risk for gallstone-related pathology is also related to the number and size of stones with numerous larger stones more likely to cause symptoms. For this reason, it is suggested that once symptoms present, the patient should be offered a cholecystectomy.

The main risk factors for gallstone formation are outlined in Table 1, and the factors protective against gallstones are outlined in Table 2.

Table 1
Main risk factors for gallstone formation

Table 2
Factors protective against gallstones

There are three main types of gallstones: cholesterol, mixed and pigmented. Cholesterol gallstones account for 10% of gallstones and are composed of at least 50% cholesterol and form with supersaturation of bile. Patients with high-fat diets and high serum lipids are more likely to have a higher cholesterol composition. Pigmented gallstones, which are darker in colour and are composed mainly of bilirubin with < 20% cholesterol, form with supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. There are two subtypes of pigmented gallstones: black pigmented gallstones which are formed due to chronic haemolysis, cirrhosis or intestinal malabsorption, and brown pigmented gallstones which are formed secondary to bacterial and parasitic infections such as Clonorchis sinensis or due to stasis of bile. Finally, mixed gallstones account for 80% of gallstones and have a cholesterol content of 20–50%.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for choledocholithiasis, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to do not rely solely on elevated LFTs or bilirubin for identifying common bile duct stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, rather obtain further diagnostic tests.

### Radiological biliary intervention for stone disease [^dce1a733]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are crystalized particles composed mainly of cholesterol and sometimes bilirubin, typically developing in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of those calculi (stones) in the common bile duct (CBD). It is the primary cause of non-malignant bile duct obstruction. The formation of gallstones is influenced by various clinical conditions and factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, genetics, obesity, female sex, and age. The most common etiological factor for choledocholithiasis is the migration of gallbladder stones to the CBD and intrahepatic ducts through the cystic duct. This occurs in approximately 3–15% of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Another common cause of choledocholithiasis is inadequate bile drainage due to obstructions, such as postsurgical bile duct strictures, which can lead to acute cholangitis or other inflammatory conditions. Hepatolithiasis is the formation of stones in the intrahepatic biliary tract. This condition is often recurrent and requires multiple therapeutic interventions. Treatment for choledocholithiasis is necessary for symptomatic patients, and is recommended for asymptomatic patients given the risk of serious complications, such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice (which can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis), and pancreatitis.

### Predictors of bile tree pathology in patients presenting with gallbladder disease [^ecb6fdd9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with gallstone disease can present with elevated liver function tests (LFTs). It is often challenging to differentiate those with a common bile duct (CBD) stone from those without a CBD stone on the basis of the LFTs levels. In this study, we aim to evaluate the predictors of a CBD stones among patients presenting with symptomatic gallbladder disease and elevated LFTs.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively examined all patients who had undergone a cholecystectomy between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis and increased LFTs were included. Patient characteristics, imaging findings, lab findings, endoscopic interventions, and operative report were recorded and evaluated. The diagnosis of CBD stones was made on the basis of ERCP and IOC findings.

Results

We included 354 patients in the final analysis. Of these, 113 (32%) had confirmed choledocholithiasis. The prevalence of CBD stones among biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, and pancreatitis patients was 47, 25, and 26%, respectively. γ-Glutamyl transferase and direct bilirubin had the highest sensitivities for CBD stones among these patients (83 vs. 79%). In the setting of biliary colic, total bilirubin was highly predictive of CBD stones with a positive predictive value of 85%. In the setting of acute cholecystitis, elevated LFTs were even less significant in predicting stones, with a positive predictive value of less than 40% for most.

Conclusion

Although γ-glutamyl transferase and bilirubin levels showed a relatively higher sensitivity for CBDS compared with the other LFTs, these were not reliable enough because of high false-positive as well as false-negative values, especially in patients presenting with acute cholecystitis.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic complications of sickle cell disease [^9e190ff9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive abnormality of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin (Hb), resulting in poorly deformable sickled cells that cause microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. The spleen is almost always affected by SCD, with microinfarcts within the first 36 months of life resulting in splenic atrophy. Acute liver disorders causing right-sided abdominal pain include acute vaso-occlusive crisis, liver infarction, and acute hepatic crisis. Chronic liver disease might be due to hemosiderosis and hepatitis and possibly to SCD itself if small, clinically silent microvascular occlusions occur chronically. Black pigment gallstones caused by elevated bilirubin excretion are common. Their small size permits them to travel into the common bile duct but cause only low-grade obstruction, so hyperbilirubinemia rather than bile duct dilatation is typical. Whether cholecystectomy should be done in asymptomatic individuals is controversial. The most common laboratory abnormality is an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin level. Bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels correlate with one another, suggesting that chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, rather than liver disease, are the sources of hyperbilirubinemia. Abdominal pain is very common in SCD and is usually due to sickling, which resolves with supportive care. Computed tomography scans might be ordered for severe or unremitting pain. The liver typically shows sickled erythrocytes and Kupffer cell enlargement acutely and hemosiderosis chronically. The safety of liver biopsies has been questioned, particularly during acute sickling crisis. Treatments include blood transfusions, exchange transfusions, iron-chelating agents, hydroxyurea, and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

Role of ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis — Most patients with gallstone pancreatitis will not benefit from ERCP, including early ERCP. In a multicenter trial of early ERCP, early (within 24 hours) ERCP was not found to decrease complications, including mortality, and urgent ERCP was indicated only for cholangitis or progressive cholestasis defined by a rise in bilirubin in the setting of severe or moderately severe AP (bilirubin > 3–5 mg/dL).

### Lithogenesis and bile metabolism [^42d208d6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease exacts a considerable financial and social burden worldwide leading to frequent physician visits and hospitalizations. Based on their composition, gallstones are categorized as cholesterol, black pigment, and brown pigment, with each category having a unique structural, epidemiologic, and risk factor profile. Cholesterol crystal formation requires the presence of one or more of the following: (a) cholesterol supersaturation, (b) accelerated nucleation, or (c) gallbladder hypomotility/bile stasis. Some risk factors for cholesterol stones include age, gender, genetics, obesity, rapid weight loss, and ileal disease. Generally, pigment stones are formed by the precipitation of bilirubin in bile, with black stones associated with chronic hemolytic states, cirrhosis, Gilbert syndrome, or cystic fibrosis, and brown stones associated with chronic bacterial or parasitic infections.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^5794d13f]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Severe elevation of liver tests in choledocholithiasis: an uncommon occurrence with important clinical implications [^76eeb6fa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Choledocholithiasis is not commonly associated with dramatic elevations in aminotransferase or total serum bilirubin. Ours is the largest case series thus far studying the prevalence of dramatic elevations in liver tests associated with choledocholithiasis.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choledocholithiasis diagnosed on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiogram at a tertiary referral hospital over 7 years. We identified 740 patients with available liver tests and determined the prevalence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 1000 IU/L and of total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL. We compared clinical characteristics of these 2 nonoverlapping groups.

Results

Of 740 patients, AST and/or ALT values > 1000 IU/L were present in 45 (6.1%) patients. On average AST and ALT decreased 79% and 56%, respectively, at discharge 1 to 8 days later. Total serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL were present in 35 (4.7%) patients and decreased by an average of 64% at discharge 1 to 8 days later. When compared with the group with total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL, the group with elevated aminotransferases had significantly more females (93% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), had smaller common bile duct diameter (8.5 vs. 10.6 mm, P = 0.04), and were more likely to have had a prior cholecystectomy (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). These 80 patients had higher utilization of health resources: half had additional laboratory studies and one fourth had additional imaging studies performed.

Conclusions

In patients with high AST and/or ALT and serum total bilirubin levels with known choledocholithiasis, elaborate work up to look for another etiology is not required. As long as the values decrease significantly, they do not need to be followed until they normalize in the same hospitalization.

### Unconjugated bilirubin in human bile: the nucleating factor in cholesterol cholelithiasis? [^6b728fe0]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the concentrations of bilirubin, bilirubin conjugates, phospholipid, and cholesterol in the gall bladder bile obtained at surgery from patients with and without cholesterol gallstones.

Methods

Gall bladder bile was collected during surgery, by puncture, from 20 patients with gallstones undergoing routine cholecystectomy and from eight patients with normal liver blood tests. Concentrations of bilirubin, bilirubin conjugates, phospholipid, and cholesterol were measured using standard procedures.

Results

The proportion of total bilirubin that was unconjugated was significantly higher in the bile from patients with stones than in bile from control patients, whether or not the bile from either group was saturated with cholesterol or not. Indeed, the mean concentration of cholesterol was significantly higher in control bile samples.

Conclusion

The presence of stones was more closely related to the proportion of unconjugated bilirubin than to the degree of saturation of bile with cholesterol. Bilirubin and its metabolites probably play an important part in the formation of cholesterol gallstones.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^37f5de0d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

One flaw of the study is that index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of CBDS is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated LFTs; this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.1 We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC, in which case we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LTFs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a NPV of 97%, whereas the PPV of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature ranging from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction; a proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had CBDS. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of patients with ACC without CBDS had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leucocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis. Padda et al. found that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without CBDS had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT. Among patients with ACC and CBDS, 77% had raised ALP, 60% had abnormal bilirubin and 90% had elevated ALT; multivariate analysis showed that increased common bile duct size and elevated ALT and ALP were predictors of CBDS. The diagnostic accuracy increases for cholestasis tests, such as serum bilirubin, with the duration and the severity of obstruction. Specificity of serum bilirubin levels for CBDS was 60% with a cut-off level of 1.7 mg/day and 75% with a cut-off level of 4 mg/dl; however, mean level of bilirubin in patients with CBDS is generally lower (1.5 to 1.9 mg/dl).

### How often are liver function tests normal in acute biliary pancreatitis? [^fdf3f30c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The biochemical markers of a biliary etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) include an ALT elevation of more than 3 times the upper range of normal (ULN) and a serum total bilirubin greater than 3 mg%.

Objectives

To analyze the frequency of normal LFTs (Bilirubin, ALP, ALT, and AST) in patients with biliary AP.

Design

In this prospective study data collected for other ongoing studies on AP in the division of Gastroenterology in the last 20 years were analyzed.

Material and Methods

Serum total Bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 269 patients with biliary AP out of 728 cases of AP of various etiologies were analyzed. The biliary etiology was confirmed on the basis of gallstones documented by transabdominal US or at surgery.

Results

We noted normal bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 14.5%, 12.3%, 11.2%, and 26.4% of cases of acute biliary pancreatitis respectively. When all the 4 laboratory tests were considered collectively, the incidence of normal values was 10.4%. We also noted an ALT elevation of < 3 × ULN in 16.7% of cases of biliary AP and 43.5% of cases had a T. Bilirubin level of less than 3 mg %.

Conclusions

Almost 15 to 20% of patients with biliary AP manifest with normal LFTs. The clinician should not exclude a biliary etiology solely on the basis of normal LFTs.

### Practical recommendations for the prediction and management of common bile duct stones in patients with gallstones [^9a497240]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 10% of patients with symptomatic gallstones may have associated common bile duct stones (CBDS). However, the predictive value of noninvasive tests as well as the preoperative diagnosis and management of CBDS have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to define an accurate and simple model for the prediction and management of CBDS.

Methods

A prospective database containing 986 cholecystectomies performed from 1994 through 1999 was evaluated. Univariate analysis using the Pearson chi-square test was performed to determine the factors significantly related to the presence of CBDS. Then logistic regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis to discover independent predictors.

Results

Of the 986 patients in this study, 48 (5%) had CBDS. Of the 48 patients with choledocholithiasis, 22 (46%) were men and 26 (54%) were women. The mean age was 55.3 years (range, 16–87 years). As a result of multivariate analysis, abdominal ultrasonographic findings suggestive of CBDS (common bile duct diameter exceeding 8 mm or visible stones), total bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels above normal were the independent predictors of CBDS in patients age 70 or younger. On the other hand, an elevated bilirubin level was found to be the single independent factor related to CBDS in the elderly.

Conclusions

For patients with gallstones, suggestive ultrasonographic findings in those younger than 71 years and elevated direct or total bilirubin level in those older than 70 years are the most valuable and practical predictors of CBDS, and thus are the proper indications for preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.

### Integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, and GWAS helps reveal molecular mechanisms for metabolite levels and disease risk [^5b4b4e92]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Omics data are often integrated with GWAS results to help identify underlying disease mechanisms, but usually only a single type of omics data are used. For example, transcriptomics data are routinely integrated with disease GWASs through TWASs or colocalization analysis. Here, we integrated transcriptomics results of 49 human tissues and metabolomics results of 1,391 plasma metabolites together with GWAS associations for 2,861 disease traits. Few approaches exist for integrating multiple molecular traits with GWASs. They are either computationally challenging or sensitive to prior settings. Instead, we applied a straightforward approach to integrate transcriptomics and metabolomics with GWAS results simultaneously through matching the results for the three sets of pairwise integrative analyses. Our strategy can be easily extended to up to ∼10 traits by integrating results from all pairwise analyses. For even larger numbers of traits, alternative strategies will most likely be needed. We showed that pairwise integration of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and GWAS results facilitates uncovering unknown or more specific disease mechanisms compared to integration of a single type of molecular data. Metabolomics data are becoming available in increasingly large samples, for example the metabolomics profiling of UK Biobank participants. We anticipate that our study will encourage the integration of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and disease GWASs in the future both within and across studies.

Gallbladder disorders are common, having a combined prevalence of 12.5% in US adults. A previous study identified a causal role of plasma bilirubin on symptomatic gallstone disease.GWASs for bilirubin levels have uncovered an association of the UGT1A1 locus, at which a genetic variant was associated with increased risk of gallstone disease. However, the effect of UGT1A1 expression on plasma bilirubin levels in gallstone disease has previously been unclear. Here, we identified a putative causal effect of UGT1A1 / UGT1A4 expression on elevated plasma (E, E)-bilirubin levels. We demonstrated that the elevated plasma (E, E)-bilirubin levels increase risk of gallbladder disorders.

AMD is the major common cause of blindness in developed countries. The association of LIPC with AMD is well established. A recent study identified LIPC polymorphisms associated with phosphatidylethanolamine metabolites in AMD case-control populations. Our study provides the evidence to support a putative causal role of LIPC expression on AMD through glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways.

Gallstone pancreatitis — role of early ERCP: In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis we recommend against urgent (within 48 hours) ERCP (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Five RCTs informed mortality and 7 RCTs informed systemic and local adverse events; early ERCP does not reduce mortality versus a conservative approach (risk ratio [RR], .74 [95% CI, .18–3.03], I² = 62%) and did not diminish local (RR, .85 [95% CI, .52–1.43], I² = 12%) or systemic adverse events (RR, .59 [95% CI, .31–1.11], I² = 14%). Conservative treatment included analgesics, intravenous fluids, selective ERCP for cholangitis, rising bilirubin, or clinical deterioration, and the meta-analysis did not show a reduction in mortality, systemic, or local adverse events for patients with predicted severe disease.

Gallstone pancreatitis — early ERCP: A cited meta-analysis "demonstrated that early ERCP does not decrease the mortality or adverse events of gallstone pancreatitis". The panel notes that "ERCP carries a risk of harm in addition to cost and inconvenience without clear benefit", and clarifies, "Our recommendation against early ERCP does not apply to patients with gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis". Trials referenced excluded patients with "a bilirubin < 5 mg/dL", and instituted ERCP for those with "an increase of bilirubin > 3 mg/dL". The page states these positions align with guidance that "also suggest against routine use of urgent ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis".

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (UPGRADE trial) [^8cd7ed7c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary outcome measure

The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as hospital admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Hospital visit is a condition, because all patients with noteworthy symptoms will eventually visit the hospital. Mild and self-limiting complaints are not a large burden to the health care system or to the patient, and usually gallstone involvement is not objectified in these patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease is defined as biliary pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or biliary colics. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in the presence of two of the three following: upper abdominal pain; serum lipase or amylase levels above 3 times the upper level of normal; characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Pancreatitis is regarded of biliary origin when imaging reveals gallstones, sludge or a dilated common bile duct, or when laboratory investigation reveals an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 2 times higher than normal values, with ALT > aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the updated Tokyo Guidelines. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of at least one local sign of inflammation (either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count). Choledocholithiasis is defined as the presence of stones in the extrahepatic bile ducts as proven by clinical imaging, or clinical suspicion based on abnormal liver function tests in combination with upper abdominal pain for which an ERCP or PTC was indicated. Cholangitis is diagnosed when there is a sign of systemic inflammation (fever/shaking chills or laboratory evidence of inflammatory response) and either clinical or laboratory evidence of cholestasis (total bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L, or increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ALT, or AST > 1.5× higher than the upper limit of normal value) or evidence of cholestasis on biliary imaging (biliary dilatation or evidence of the etiology on imaging). Biliary colics are defined as upper abdominal pain (either right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) lasting at least 30 min with gallstones visible on ultrasound, according to the Rome criteria. In case of doubt whether a participant has reached the primary endpoint, endpoint adjudication will be done by an independent blinded committee.

### Role of intraoperative cholangiography for detecting residual stones after biliary pancreatitis: still useful? A retrospective study [^92a8fe62]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

GGT and ALP concentrations are regarded as sensitive markers for the presence of stones in the CBD. Another study, however, reported that increases in bilirubin and ALP, as well as CBD dilatation, are not associated with abnormal cholangiograms. We found that preoperative bilirubin, ALP, and GGT concentrations were similar in patients with and without stones on IOC.

A study of all patients who underwent cholecystectomy in Uppsala, Sweden, found that elevated ALP and bilirubin concentrations were the best predictors of CBD stone, but IOC yielded false positive (5%) and false negative (1%) results. Normal bilirubin and ALP levels in patients with CBD stones can be due to partial obstruction or migration of the stone before the surgical procedure. In contrast, elevated bilirubin and ALP levels in patients without CBD stones can be due to a secretory hepatic dysfunction, to a migration of stones in the duodenum, and to sludge or to CBD compression caused by other conditions.

Diagnosis of remnant stones in the CBD after ABP remains a challenge. Efforts to selectively manage patients with ABP, based on variables, including ultrasound findings and ALP, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin concentrations, have attempted to identify patients requiring IOC. Stratification was not possible, and the decision to perform IOC was based on the results of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Endoscopic ultrasound can be considered to perform diagnosis of CBD stones, but is not available in all hospitals, and the results of MRCP can be comparable and more safe. Another study reported that some patients positive on IOC were negative on postoperative ERCP, suggesting that IOC is unnecessary. Moreover, only 2–3% of patients with markers indicative of CBD stones who did not undergo IOC were later admitted for CBD stones, again suggesting that IOC is unnecessary. A recent study specifically assessing the impact of IOC on recurrent pancreatitis found that IOC did not improve the outcome after cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis.

The limitations of the present work are the small number of the patients analyzed and that is a retrospective study.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^6c1be7e7]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Severity of gallstone-, sludge-, or microlithiasis-induced pancreatitis-all of the same? [^c7611d00]. Pancreas (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

Severity of microlithiasis- and sludge-induced pancreatitis in comparison to gallstone-induced pancreatitis has never been studied for a lack of definition.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, 263 patients with acute biliary pancreatitis treated at a tertiary care center from 2005 to 2021 were stratified according to the recent consensus definition for microlithiasis and sludge. The gallstone-pancreatitis cohort was compared to microlithiasis, sludge, and suspected stone passage pancreatitis cohorts in terms of pancreatitis outcome, liver function, and endosonography/endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography results using one-way analysis of variance and χ² test. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to correct for bias.

Results

Microlithiasis- and sludge-induced pancreatitis, classified according to the revised Atlanta classification, did not present with a milder course than gallstone-induced pancreatitis (P = 0.62). Microlithiasis and sludge showed an increase in bilirubin on the day of admission to hospital, which was not significantly different from gallstone-induced pancreatitis (P = 0.36). The likelihood of detecting biliary disease on endosonography resulting in bile duct clearance was highest on the day of admission and day 1, respectively.

Conclusions

Microlithiasis and sludge induce gallstone-equivalent impaired liver function tests and induce pancreatitis with similar severity compared with gallstone-induced acute biliary pancreatitis.

5.4 Liver Test Elevations

In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 × ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and 3 healthy volunteers [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation.

Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1- to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3–5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3 to 5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines, or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found.

5.5 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis

Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis or cholangitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking SIGNIFOR. Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and periodically during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR and treat appropriately.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding with hemobilia caused by gallstones [^d9eb17ba]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemobilia refers to bleeding in the biliary tract, commonly due to iatrogenic, traumatic, and neoplastic causes. It is a rare source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but it can be severe and fatal. However, gallstones account for 5%-15% of hemobilia cases.

Case Report

A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease visited the emergency department with complaints of epigastric pain and vomiting of coffee ground-like content for 2 days. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory tests showed anemia with a hemoglobin count of 10.7 mg/dL and elevated liver function tests with total and direct bilirubin levels of 3.6 mg/dL and 2.5 mg/dL, respectively. Panendoscopy showed oozing of coffee ground-like material at the orifice of the ampulla of Vater and second portion of the duodenum, leading to suspicion of hemobilia. After admission, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed common bile duct (CBD) dilatation with choledocholithiasis, biliary sludge, and filling defect at the middle section of the CBD. Endoscopic sphincterotomy with balloon lithotripsy was performed. After biliary decompression and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration, abdominal pain was relieved, and liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels improved. Symptoms of hemobilia depend on the bleeding rate and presence of bile duct obstructions due to clots. Minor and slow bleeding tend to form clots and cause biliary obstruction. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although minor hemobilia may remain asymptomatic and tends to resolve spontaneously, the cause of hemobilia must be corrected to prevent recurrent bleeding or obstruction.

### Liraglutide [^b4a648a9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis:

In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection- treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Tests

Bilirubin:

In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown.

Calcitonin:

Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less.

Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin < 20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to > 20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Lipase and Amylase:

In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Vital signs

Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo.

### Gallstones and biliary colic… [^f7740fc5]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sometimes, the cholesterol in bile can deposit and form thick crystals or stones. Being older than 40 years, female, rapidly losing or gaining weight, at increased weight, or pregnant are some of the risk factors for gallstones. One in 5 people have gallstones, but only one-third of patients with gallstones will ever have pain from them. Among all patients with gallstones, only 1% to 3% each year have complications. When a meal is ingested, the gallbladder squeezes the bile into the small bowel to help digest fat. In this process, gallstones can get stuck in the thin duct that connects the gallbladder to the main bile duct. As the gallbladder contracts to push the bile across the blockage, it can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. This is a continuous pain felt mostly in the upper part of the abdomen, the back, or the right shoulder.

If the stone is completely stuck and cannot be pushed into the small intestine, it can lead to gallbladder infection, obstruction of the bile flow from the common bile duct, or inflammation of the pancreas. The type of complication depends on where exactly the stone is impacted. The diagnosis is made by performing a physical examination, blood tests, and an ultrasound of the abdomen. Sometimes a radionuclide scan may be necessary. Because most people with gallstones never have symptoms, there is no need for preventive interventions. Treatment is recommended for patients with symptoms of biliary colic or one of the above described complications. Although a medication called ursodiol may prevent the formation of new stones, it does not work well for treating existing stones. The only definitive treatment for gallstones is surgical removal of the entire gallbladder, also known as cholecystectomy.

Extracting the individual stones while leaving the gallbladder in place does not work because the body will continue to make more stones. Since the gallbladder has no other function other than to store bile, removing it does not have any serious consequences — the liver will continue to produce just as much bile as before surgery. Some patients may develop mild diarrhea that usually improves with time.

### Rolling stones: an instructive case of neonatal cholestasis [^f11c61bd]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants who remain jaundiced after 2 weeks of life must be evaluated quickly. Jaundice caused by indirect (or unconjugated) bilirubin in the newborn period is most commonly due to red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis), breastfeeding or breast milk. Jaundice caused by direct (or conjugated) bilirubin is most commonly due to liver impairment, such as cholestasis. Cholestasis in the newborn can be due to immaturity or impairment of their hepatic excretory function, inborn errors causing dysfunction of the biliary system, as well as an increased susceptibility to viral and toxic insults. In term infants, the most common identifiable causes of neonatal cholestasis are biliary atresia (BA) and rare genetic disorders. In premature infants, it is important to also consider total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use and sepsis. It is important to rule out biliary atresia (BA) immediately as the prognosis is best when interventions are performed early. Here we describe an instructive case of cholestasis caused by bile duct obstruction from gallstones. Management of infants with choledocholithiasis is not well studied, as it is a rare cause of cholestasis in this population. This case demonstrates the importance of considering choledocholithiasis on the differential for cholestasis in neonates.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^18df65b3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was carried out among adult (age > 18 years) symptomatic patients with GS admitted to Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka for surgical removal of GS over a period of 18 months. A total of 102 patients underwent GS removal surgeries during the study period and the relevant data of each patient were recorded in an examiner administered individual formatted data sheets after obtaining informed written consent. These include demographic data (age, gender and ethnicity) and the presence of known aetiological factors for GS disease. The considered aetiological factors include age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, family history of GS disease and comorbid conditions (type II diabetes mellitus - DM, dyslipidaemia, chronic haemolytic anaemia, chronic liver disease, ileal resection and ileal bypass surgeries). Females were additionally questioned on parity and use of exogenous oesterogen therapy (oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy). Number of still and live births were considered to determine the parity.

Weight and height of the patients were measured using standard techniques and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. According to the BMI values, patients were classified into two groups as normal, overweight or obese. The categorization was done using WHO BMI cutoff values given for the South Asian community and whole world. According to the cutoff values for whole world, patients with BMI less than 25 kg/m 2 were classified into normal and 25 kg/m 2 or above as overweight and obese. According to the South Asian cutoff values patients with BMI less than 23 kg/m 2 were classified as normal and 23 kg/m 2 or above as overweight and obese.

Patients with normal serum bilirubin (total) were further tested for serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol and LDL - cholesterol using 2 mL of venous blood obtained after 12 hours of fasting period. Serum lipid parameters were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric method according to the procedure given in commercially available enzymatic kits purchased from Aggape diagnostics, Germany.

### UGT1A1 variation and gallstone formation in sickle cell disease [^31a31b44]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Pigment gallstones are a common clinical complication of sickle cell (SS) disease. Genetic variation in the promoter of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) underlies Gilbert syndrome, a chronic form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and appears to be a risk factor for gallstone formation. We investigated the association between UGT1A1 (TA)(n) genotype, hyperbilirubinemia, and gallstones in a sample of Jamaicans with SS disease. Subjects were from the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study (cohort sample, n = 209) and the Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica (clinic sample, n = 357). The UGT1A1 (TA)(n) promoter region was sequenced in 541 SS disease subjects and 111 healthy controls (control sample). Indirect bilirubin levels for (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) and (TA)(7)/(TA)(8) genotypes were elevated compared with (TA)(6)/(TA)(6) (clinic sample, P < 10⁻⁵; cohort sample, P < 10⁻³). The (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype was also associated with symptomatic presentation and gallstones in the clinic sample (odds ratio [OR] = 11.3; P = 7.0 × 10⁻⁴) but not in the younger cohort sample. These unexpected findings indicate that the temporal evolution of symptomatic gallstones may involve factors other than the bilirubin level. Although further studies of the pathogenesis of gallstones in SS disease are required, the (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype may be a risk factor for symptomatic gallstones in older people with SS disease.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^72740ede]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — role of surgery and biliary management: Key concepts state that patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis "should undergo cholecystectomy early, preferably before discharge", that "Minimally invasive methods are preferred to open surgery for debridement and necrosectomy in stable patients with symptomatic pancreatic necrosis", and that "We suggest delaying any intervention… in stable patients with pancreatic necrosis, preferably 4 weeks, to allow for the wall of necrosis to mature". Supporting evidence indicates that in mild gallstone pancreatitis, same-admission cholecystectomy decreases recurrent gallstone-related complications with low risk; across 8 cohort studies and 1 randomized trial describing 998 patients, 95 (18%) were readmitted for recurrent biliary events (18% vs 0%, P < 0.0001), including recurrent biliary pancreatitis (n = 38, 8%). In biliary AP, routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not appropriate unless there is high suspicion of a persistent common bile duct stone with elevated bilirubin; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can be used preoperatively in low to moderate risk but routine use is unnecessary. Patients unable to undergo surgery can receive biliary sphincterotomy to prevent recurrent biliary AP, and when biliary pancreatitis is complicated by pancreatic necrosis, cholecystectomy is typically delayed during prolonged hospitalization or after discharge.

### Is endoscopic treatment beneficial in patients with clinically suspicious of common bile duct stones but no obvious filling defects during the ERCP examination? [^38c9297e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Demographic data was shown in Table 2. No significant difference was found at gender, age, body mass index (BMI), initial GPT and ALP level, history of cholecystectomy, presence/absence of gallbladder stones, and juxta-papillary diverticulum (JPD), between patients with final positive or negative stone extraction. There were only initial cholangitis and high probability of CBDS significantly associated with positive stone extraction. There were total 141 (male/female: 81/60) patients, clinically suspicious of CBD stones (intermediate probability: 28, high probability: 113), undergoing successful therapeutic ERCP (EST/EPBD: 30/111) with which pre-treatment cholangiogram (ERC) showed no obvious filling defects. For the group of positive stone extraction (70 patients), there were 64 patients showed detectable (all are barely visible by naked eyes and un-measurable) stones and six patients showed microlithiasis under microscopic analysis of bile. However, there were only 21 samples of bile available for analysis (21/141 = 14.9%). With regard to the high probability group of CBDS, 65 cases presented with evidence of CBDS at initial image, 25 with acute cholangitis, 10 with total bilirubin level > 4 mg/dL, and 13 with mild elevated total bilirubin (1.8–4 mg/dL) and CBDdilatation. On the other hand, in the intermediate probability group, 16 cases presented with mild elevated total bilirubin (1.8–4 mg/dL) without CBD dilatation, six with CBD dilatation without elevated total bilirubin, two with gallstone pancreatitis, and four with age > 55 year-old. Besides, the mean length of EST was 0.91 cm (0.5 cm ~ 1.5 cm); and the mean size of dilating balloon was 0.99 cm (0.6 cm ~ 1.8 cm), depend on the relative sizes of CBD. ERCP was performed at a mean of four days after admission.

### The value of percutaneous ultrasound in predicting conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis [^3cd81f92]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Concomitant choledocholithiasis, usually found in 10–12% of the cases, is not a direct contraindication for LCH as long as ductal calculi are removed endoscopically before or sometimes after the operation, or during LCH by transcystic or direct laparoscopic CBD exploration. The principal issue is to establish indications for ES. The primary diagnostic imaging method used to check for indications to use ES and CBD exploration is percutaneous ultrasound, although its limitations in the evaluation of the bile ducts narrow its sensitivity to 68–94%. Moreover, serum testing for bilirubin level, alkaline phosphatase, liver transaminases, and lipase should be assessed initially and monitored during the course of the disease. In most cases, a raised bilirubin level in acute cholecystitis results from inflammatory infiltration of Calot's triangle and decreases after the implementation of antibiotic therapy. An elevated bilirubin level may also be associated with Mirizzi syndrome, which in turn may increase the probability of conversion.

### Association between C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio and gallstones: a cross-sectional study [^cf5886a9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease is a prevalent digestive condition characterized by the formation of solid crystalline material within the gallbladder or biliary tract. This disorder is widespread globally, with particularly high prevalence rates in Western nations. Studies indicate that approximately 10–15% of American adults and up to 20% of European adults are affected by gallstones. These stones are primarily composed of cholesterol, bile pigments, or a combination of both, with stones composed of cholesterol being the most prevalent, especially in Western populations. Clinically, gallstones may present with a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild digestive discomfort to severe complications. In the early stages, most patients are asymptomatic, a condition termed "silent" or "occult gallstones". However, complications like acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis can result in pronounced symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice, which may be life-threatening if untreated. Moreover, gallstone disease poses a significant healthcare burden, contributing to increased healthcare costs and resource utilization. Complications often necessitate prolonged hospitalization and complex surgical interventions, exacerbating both individual and systemic healthcare expenses.

### Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pyogenic liver abscess in people 65 years or older versus people under 65: a retrospective study [^ef21eedf]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

With regard to the laboratory findings at the time of the consult, we did not observe significant differences in the variables collected, including bilirubin or leukocyte values. These data are consistent with those reported elsewhere. We only found a significant difference in the higher value of GGT among the older group, probably due to the greater biliary aetiology of liver abscesses in this study.

The main microbiological technique was the culture of PLA tissue, which was usually accompanied by blood culture. We did not observe significant differences between groups, either in the technique used or the positivity found. Traditional series show S. aureus to be the principal germ isolated in hepatic cultures, but E. coli is also a common cause of PLA. K. pneumoniae PLA have been widely described, particularly in southeast Asian countries. In in our series, K. pneumoniae was not the most common microorganism, but rather E. coli followed by the S. anginosus group; K. pneumoniae ranked third. The differences observed in our study may be because we did not perform enough blood cultures or obtain sufficient pus for cultures, or possibly because antibiotics were administered before cultures were obtained. In this case, cultures may not test positive the first time, and isolating the microorganism may require multiple attempts. In a recent comparative study of PLA in 264 patients with K. pneumonia and 24 patients with E. coli, the latter bacterium affected older patients and was more commonly associated with hyperbilirubinemia, increased GGT and gallstones. Likewise, in our study E. coli and gallstones were significantly more common in patients over 65.

### Risk factors associated with symptomatic cholelithiasis in Taiwan: a population-based study [^ea4950f7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In selecting the medical conditions for analysis, we were constrained by the level of specificity within the database (e.g. data for hyperlipidemia were available, but data for HDL and LDL levels were not provided). We were particularly interested in evaluating medical conditions with particular relevance to the population of Taiwan. Hepatitis B and C were of interest, because their prevalence is much higher in Taiwan than in western countries. Conversely, blood cholesterol level was not evaluated, because the majority of cases of cholelithiasis in Taiwan do not involve cholesterol stones (see below).

Gallstones are generally classified as belonging to one of two types: cholesterol stones, and pigment stones. Pigment stones can be further subdivided into high-residue pigment, low-residue pigment, and muddy pigment stones. Cholesterol stones are formed by the precipitation of cholesterol as solid crystals from supersaturated bile and reflect high levels of hepatic cholesterol secretion. Pigment stones, which are more predominant in the Asian population, are composed primarily of bilirubinate salts and oxidized tetrapyrrolic derivatives formed by polymerization of unconjugated bilirubin. This type of gallstone is linked to hemolysis, bacterial infection, or liver disease, rather than hormonal factors. Others also report an association between pigment gallstones and advancing age and possibly alcoholism. We were unable to directly assess the distribution of gallstone types in this study, because no clinical test reports regarding signs of hyperhemolysis (lower hemoglobin content) were available in the database. Chronic liver disease is a well-recognized risk factor for cholelithiasis. Fatty liver, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, elevated ALT levels, and cirrhosis have all been found to be related to cholelithiasis in different small studies. In Taiwan there is known to be a higher prevalence of viral hepatitis than in other regions. Our study confirms that hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis contribute a significant risk for cholelithiasis. Additional studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between cholelithiasis, virus hepatitis, alcohol-related cirrhosis, viral hepatitis cirrhosis, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are needed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^376f0048]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Rolling stones: an instructive case of neonatal cholestasis [^8a52c5c0]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jaundice within the first 1-2weeks of a neonate's life will generally self-resolve; however, if it lasts longer than this time frame it warrants further work up. Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can suggest neonatal cholestasis, which in turn reflects marked reduction in bile secretion and flow. The differential diagnosis for neonatal cholestasis is broad. Neonatal choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of neonatal cholestasis, but should be considered on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated conjugated bilirubin.

Case Presentation

We describe an infant who presented with neonatal cholestasis. He subsequently underwent work up for biliary atresia, as this is one of the more time-sensitive diagnoses that must be made in neonates with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. He was ultimately found to have choledocholithiasis on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. He was managed conservatively with optimizing nutrition and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.

Conclusions

We found that conservative management, specifically optimizing nutrition and treating with ursodeoxycholic acid, can be a sufficient approach to facilitating resolution of the choledocholithiasis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Predictors of abnormalities on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: is there a role when the biliary tree is normal on previous imaging? [^a59f0a63]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations to this study include the numerous indications for imaging requests. These were not standardized and the indication was variable according to the clinical information volunteered by the clinician writing the request form, many of whom were junior doctors. For example, we were unable to differentiate between abdominal pain and pancreatitis. In addition fever was listed in several cases: it is possible, however, that this may have been a symptom for other patients but was not volunteered on the request form. In addition, this study was performed retrospectively for a group of patients investigated with MRCP and we do not have a control group to compare our cohort with.

Statistically we have demonstrated that it is efficacious to proceed to MRCP with abnormal findings on index imaging, clinical jaundice or elevated serum ALP. However other clinical indices, such as pain or abnormal liver chemistry (other than raised ALP), are not independently predictive of a positive finding on MRCP. In the context of normal CBD size on index imaging, having a concurrent elevated ALP is a predictor of positive MRCP findings.

This study has identified that there is a reasonable diagnostic yield for MRCP in the absence of a dilated biliary system on previous US/CT. We propose that there should be a specific rationale for performing MRCP when initial imaging is normal. This study recommends that MRCP should be strongly considered in the context of an elevated ALP and normal US/CT biliary system. In addition, we suggest a bilirubin threshold of > 40 µmol/L can be used as an indicator of clinical jaundice.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Cholelithiasis is increasingly common, with a UK prevalence of 15%
10–20% of the 15–26% of patients with symptomatic gallstones will progress to develop choledocholithiasis
UK NICE guidelines recommend the use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in cases of abnormal liver function tests or a dilated common bile duct (CBD)

What the new findings are:

Normal index imaging reduces the risk of an abnormal CBD on MRCP by 70%
A dilated CBD on index imaging, clinical jaundice or elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are independently associated with abnormal MRCP findings
MRCP should be strongly considered if there is a normal biliary system on ultrasound or computed tomography in combination with an elevated ALP
Elevated bilirubin > 40 µmol/L is significantly associated with a dilated CBD on MRCP

### Role of bile acids and bile salts in acute pancreatitis: from the experimental to clinical studies [^4c841cff]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

RELATED CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF BAs INAP

Located in the retroperitoneal space, the human pancreas is relatively difficult to access for samples by biopsy. In addition, patients with AP usually consult physicians at late stage, when the initial events of AP have already passed. Therefore, investigations that address early pathophysiological events of AP in patients are limited and even rarer when considering biliary pancreatitis. In the majority of patients with gallstone-induced AP (94.4%), gallstones were also detected in their stool. This observation suggests that AP is frequently caused by migrating gallstones with only transient blockage at the ampulla of Vater. Serum BAs were found to be elevated in all patients within the first 24 hours after the onset of acute abdominal pain, which suggests that a systemic elevation of BAs during the initial stage of biliary AP may play a role. After the first day, serum concentrations start to decrease. In patients with AP of other than biliary etiology, the total BA concentrations were lower, suggesting that, apart from bilirubin determination, also serum BA concentrations might be useful for identifying a biliary origin in equivocal cases.

An interaction of BAs and CCK in humans was demonstrated in patients with a tumor-induced bile duct stenosis who received CDCA added to a liquid test meal. These patients showed a negative feedback control of plasma CCK and had a lower postprandial CCK release. Because CCK is known to stimulate enzyme secretion not only in rodentbut also in human acinar cells, the modulation of CCK release by BAs seems to be a relevant event in biliary AP.

Besides the effects of BAs on human acinar cells, there is evidence that BA also acts on human pancreatic stellate cells. Isolated human stellate cells are able to incorporate BAs leading to a release of Ca 2+ into the cytosol, similar to acinar cells. This influx of BAs is Na + dependent and mediated by a sodium-dependent transport protein, the NTCP, which is different from acinar cells, where the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter is presumably the main transporter.

### Clinical characteristics of acute cholecystitis with elevated liver enzymes not associated with choledocholithiasis [^8fda5dd4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim/Background

Elevated liver enzymes are observed occasionally in patients with acute cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis. The etiology and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well known. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics between acute cholecystitis with and without choledocholithiasis in patients with elevated liver enzymes.

Patients and Methods

The medical records of acute cholecystitis patients who underwent cholecystectomy between January 2001 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We retrieved data of patients who showed abnormal liver enzymes and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraoperative cholangiography.

Results

We analyzed clinical characteristics and comorbidities in 424 patients. Among 424 cholecystectomy patients with abnormal liver enzymes, 178 (42%) patients did not have choledocholithiasis and 246 (58%) patients had choledocholithiasis. The median AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were 47, 82.5 IU/dl, and 1.21 mg/dl, respectively, in patients without choledocholithiasis and 58, 96 IU/dl, and 1.53 mg/dl, respectively, in patients with choledocholithiasis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fatty liver [odds ratio (OR): 0.218; P < 0.001], radiologic findings (OR: 0.414; P = 0.001), and the level of total bilirubin (OR: 1.410; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of choledocholithiasis.

Conclusion

Elevated liver enzymes in patients with cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis are correlated with the presence of fatty liver and the severity of radiologic finding.

### Bilirubin, gallstones, and mendelian randomization… [^6c6b5fe2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Gallstone disease causes a substantial health and economic burden in the United States and other developed countries. More than 6 million men and 14 million women aged 20 to 74 years in the United States have gallbladder disease. 1 Approximately 650 000 to 700 000 cholecystectomies are performed annually in the United States, and the costs associated with the symptoms and complications of gallstones are estimated to be $6. 5 billion per year. 2 Known risk factors for gallbladder disease include obesity, recent weight loss, age, hormone use, parity, lack of exercise, and alcohol use. We found the article by Stender et al interesting clinically and methodologically.

First, using observational data and multivariable analysis to adjust for a variety of known risk factors for gallbladder disease, the authors demonstrate that an elevated plasma bilirubin level is associated with a greater likelihood of symptomatic gallbladder disease. Second, using a technique referred to as mendelian randomization, the authors took advantage of the random assortment of genes that occurs during gamete formation. They demonstrate that a genetic variant that is associated with increased plasma bilirubin levels is associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic gallstone disease. Because the exposure is random, the genetic analysis increases the likelihood that the relationship between plasma bilirubin and symptomatic gallstone disease is causal.

As the human genome is increasingly defined, it is likely that mendelian randomization can become a valuable tool to help confirm or refute whether relationships between other risk factors and diseases are causal.

Patients with this condition usually have serum bilirubin levels ranging between 10 and 20 mg/dL (175 and 350 μmol/l) and seldom develop kernicterus, although neurological dysfunction may occur if hyperbilirubinemia is exacerbated by fasting, drugs or infectious diseases. There have been several published reports of increased incidence of gallstones in patients with UDP-GT mutations. In a series with 20 patients with CN type I followed over a 16-year period, half developed cholelithiasis and required elective cholecystectomy. Gallstones were detected on cholecystography in 4 of 53 patients with Gilbert's disease by Foulk et al. and required cholecystectomy in 2 of 55 patients studied by Powell et al. In a series of cholecystectomy patients, Gilbert's disease was reported in 7.5% of male patients. Several explanations for this occurrence have been suggested. One theory relates to the composition of bile which is markedly abnormal in patients with UDP-GT mutations. Due to the inability to adequately conjugate bilirubin, the bile of patients with UDP-GT mutations exhibits abnormal amounts of bilirubin mono and diglucuronides. These compounds are more prone to deconjugation by bacterial glucuronidases. Unconjugated bilirubin combines with bile calcium, leading to the formation of pigmented gallstones. This however, may prove to be insufficient as a physiopathological explanation, since most reports of gallstones in patients with UDP-GT mutations describe an additional factor such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease or spherocytosis. Nevertheless, despite an elevated risk for gallstone disease, we have only found one report of cholangitis in a patient with CN type II. Differentiation between Gilbert's disease and CN type I and II is important since treatment and prognosis are different between these entities. Although the diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds, response to phenobarbital (decrease by at least 25% in CN type II), bile analysis, measurement of UDP-GT on liver tissue and genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Interestingly, patients with atypical presentations preventing a clear differentiation between type I and II have been described, raising awareness for possible phenotypes with incomplete penetration. Although generally unnecessary, treatment options for patients with CN type II include phototherapy, plasmapheresis, enzyme induction with phenobarbital and liver transplantation. Phototherapy effectively decreased unconjugated bilirubin by converting it to a water-soluble photoisomer that can be excreted in the bile. This treatment is only temporary as skin thickness and body surface area increase with age, reducing its efficiency. Additionally, phototherapy represents a heavy burden for the patient, requiring 10 to 12 h/day of treatment. The average life expectancy for patients having type I syndrome is around 30 years. Even though the prognosis of CN type II is usually good and is compatible with a normal life span, repeated episodes of kernicterus may culminate in permanent neurological damage. The present case seemed of great interest due to the rarity of the situation, and also because of the advanced age of presentation, with the patient only presenting this frequent complication at this old age. Aside from the episode of acute gallstone pancreatitis, 7 years earlier, no other significant complications of the prolonged hyperbilirubinemia were seen in her lifetime.

### Atazanavir-associated choledocholithiasis leading to acute hepatitis in an HIV-infected adult [^fc35c533]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of atazanavir-associated choledocholithiasis in an HIV-infected individual.

Case Summary

A 47-year-old treatment-naïve HIV-positive African female presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of right epigastric pain. Six weeks prior to this episode, she began antiretroviral therapy with a regimen consisting of atazanavir 400 mg and abacavir/lamivudine 600/300 mg once daily. Alanine aminotransferase (766 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (876 U/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase (588 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (348 U/L), and total bilirubin (3.9 mg/dL) levels were elevated. Abdominal ultrasound revealed obstructive choledocholithiasis as well as intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilatation. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which revealed approximately 50 small calculi present in the gallbladder. Since previous ultrasounds had also shown gallstones, an analysis of the extracted calculi was performed to determine the possible association with atazanavir use; low amounts of atazanavir were detected.

Discussion

Atazanavir is an inhibitor of the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme UGT1A1 and has been frequently linked to the occurrence of hyperbilirubinemia without complications. This individual experienced hyperbilirubinemia that peaked at hospital presentation after she developed choledocholithiasis and secondary acute hepatitis. Analysis of the extracted gallstones revealed that smaller stones contained a higher content of atazanavir than larger stones, which suggests that atazanavir precipitation may play a role in cholelithiasis, although the mechanism remains unknown. The low yield of atazanavir may be explained by the short, 6-week duration of drug exposure as well as the lack of assay for metabolites. The Naranjo probability scale implicated choledocholithiasis as a possible atazanavir-associated adverse event. This report provides the first published evidence that even short-term use of atazanavir may lead to hyperbilirubinemia with choledocholithiasis and secondary acute hepatitis in HIV-infected adults.

Conclusions

Atazanavir should be considered a possible contributor in the development of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis, and people with HIV should receive adequate counseling in the recognition of symptoms associated with gallstones. The exact incidence and mechanism still need to be elucidated.

### Role of liver function tests in predicting common bile duct stones in acute calculous cholecystitis [^23d11b72]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The role of liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with cholelithiasis has been studied widely. However, it is not clear whether these predictive models are useful in inflammatory gallstone disease.

Methods

A review was undertaken of 385 consecutive patients admitted as an emergency for acute calculous gallbladder disease. The diagnosis of calculous cholecystitis was confirmed by ultrasonography or histological confirmation of acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Patients with obvious jaundice, defined as a bilirubin level above 80 micromol/l, and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded.

Results

Some 216 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 (13.0 per cent) were found to have CBD stones. LFT results were not significantly different in patients with chronic, acute or complicated acute cholecystitis. Using several cut-off levels, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) had the highest specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, comparable to a scoring system that combined all LFTs. Bilirubin was the least specific and predictive. A cut-off point for GGT at 90 units/l produced a sensitivity of 86 per cent (24 of 28), specificity of 74.5 per cent (140 of 188), and positive and negative predictive values of 33 per cent (24 of 72) and 97.2 per cent (140 of 144) respectively. This represented a one in three chance of CBD stones when the GGT level was above 90 units/l and a one in 30 chance when the level was less than 90 units/l.

Conclusion

Selection criteria based on GGT can be used in acute calculous cholecystitis to identify high-risk patients who would benefit most from further imaging to exclude choledocholithiasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^6a130be4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^79d21570]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^e9ac49e1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

Table 2
Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

### Routine MRCP in the management of patients with gallbladder stones awaiting cholecystectomy: a single-centre experience [^25478071]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

CBD stones are detected in 8–20% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, of which 5% are asymptomatic.

Patients presenting with CBD stones may have symptoms including biliary colic, jaundice, cholangitis, pancreatitis or may be asymptomatic.

In our results, in line with previous studies, the incidence of CBD stones is 6.7%, 8.6% of which is asymptomatic.

Many studies have been performed to seek predictive tools for the presence of CBD stones in patients with gallbladder stones awaiting cholecystectomy, showing that preoperative laboratory findings and US evaluation of choledocal diameter were individually significant predictive factors and the likelihood of CBD stones increases up to 99% when all the predictors were positive.

Liver function tests can be used to screen for CBD stones, but these are neither highly sensitive nor specific. Elevated serum bilirubin and ALP typically reflect biliary obstruction, but serum bilirubin levels may be elevated or not according to the obstruction (complete or incomplete); ALP is usually associated with symptomatic CBD stones and has the highest sensitivity in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis among the biochemical parameters.

Videhult et al. showed that almost half (48%) of the patients with CBD stones had normal ALP and bilirubin values. Thus, by using only findings of normal ALP and bilirubin as indicators of the absence of CBD stones would imply that half of CBD stones would remain undetected.

Similar conclusions were achieved by Abboud et al. about bilirubin, ALP and amylase values, showing that positive likelihood ratios for dilated CBD on US, hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice ranged from almost 4 to almost 7. Elevated levels of ALP and hyperamylasaemia exhibited positive likelihood ratios of less than 3.

Our data are in line with previous studies: the sensitivity of liver function tests is low overall, with the highest sensitivity achieved by serum ALP (85.7%).

Greater accuracy can be obtained by using laboratory findings in addition to imaging modalities.

Non-invasive imaging techniques such as US are widely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of many biliary diseases. A CBD diameter greater than 6 mm on US is associated with a higher prevalence of choledocholithiasis.

### Surgical treatment of gallstones [^95fa3d19]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Currently there is no evidence for prophylactic cholecystectomy to prevent gallstone formation (grade B). Cholecystectomy cannot be recommended for any group of patients having asymptomatic gallstones except in those undergoing major upper abdominal surgery for other pathologies (grade B). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for all patient groups with symptomatic gallstones (grade B). Patients with gallstones along with common bile duct stones treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy should undergo cholecystectomy (grade A). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration or with intraoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy is the preferred treatment for obstructive jaundice caused by common bile duct stones, when the expertise and infrastructure are available (grade B).

### Evaluation of role of hyperbilirubinemia as a new diagnostic marker of complicated appendicitis [^3a9f7e02]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Emergency appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis usually follows a short recovery period but same for the gangrenous or perforated appendicitis may be a life threatening one. To avoid morbidities prompt diagnosis is the key factor. Estimation of serum total bilirubin level is not commonly done as a marker of complicated appendicitis in an emergency setting. However, several previous studies have shown hyperbilirubinemia has high specificity for appendicular perforation. Comparison of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of serum total bilirubin in various studies including the present one has been depicted in Table 8. In adults, hyperbilirubinemia is commonly seen in liver or gallbladder diseases. Gilbert's syndrome may also cause isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia but its prevalence is 6%. This prevalence is found considerably less than the incidence of Hyperbilirubinemia associated with acute appendicitis (evidenced both in previous studies as well as present study). The data was documented at the time of admission, so hyperbilirubinemia as a consequence of liver injury due to anesthetic agents, blood transfusion, or medication was excluded. Septic shock with subsequent ischemic injury to the hepatocytes has not occurred in any of them. The explanation for this hyperbilirubinemia associated with complicated appendicitis is circulating endotoxin related to the appendiceal infection. As explained in literature, in appendicitis, elevated intra-luminal pressure and ischemic necrosis of mucosa causes tissue gangrene or perforation. This is accompanied by bacterial cytotoxin facilitated progressive bacterial invasion. This elevated load of bacteria causes direct invasion or translocation into the portal system. Direct invasion of bacteria into the hepatic parenchyma interferes with the bilirubin excretion into the bile canaliculi biochemically rather than by any obstructive pathway.

### Biliary obstruction in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: a clinical review of 16 cases [^a89bc873]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited hemolytic disease characterize by anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. The underlying defect in the spherocyte cell membrane predisposes these cells to entrapment and destruction in the spleen, leading to significantly elevated bilirubin levels in the biliary system and the formation of pigment gallstone. Consequently, complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and biliary obstruction are clinical concerns in HS patients.

The prevalence of gallbladder stone in pediatric HS patients is reported to be 17%, with this figure raising to 41% when regular biliary ultrasound scan is initiated earlier. But most these gallstones remain asymptomatic, as evidence indicated that symptomatic cases requiring cholecystectomy mainly involve cholesterol stones. Most HS pediatric cases with biliary stone are diagnosed before the age of 13. Acute biliary obstruction associated with gallstone in HS is a severe but rarely reported manifestation that sometimes be fatal. Despite its clinical significance, there is limited consensus on the optimal management strategies, particularly regarding surgical interventions.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of acute biliary obstruction in pediatric HS patients, with the goal of narrowing the existing knowledge gap and providing evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.

### CA19-9 / DBil: a promising indicator to distinguish between CA19-9-elevated pancreatic head-type autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic head cancer [^e5b16ac2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

CA19-9, also identified as sialyl Lewis A, constitutes a cell surface glycoprotein complex. CA19-9 is primarily synthesized by pancreatic and biliary ductal cells. Additionally, it can be produced on the epithelial cells of the stomach, colon, uterus, and salivary glands. CA19-9 is a widely recognized tumor marker for digestive system malignancies, particularly pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, and gallbladder cancer. Approximately 76.7% of pancreatic cancer patients experience an elevation in serum CA19-9 levels. CA19-9 aids in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients, demonstrating a sensitivity ranging from 79 to 81% and a specificity ranging from 82 to 90%. Research confirmed the association of CA19-9 levels with metastasis, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer patients. Unexpectedly, research indicated that CA19-9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, contributing to the increased growth of pancreatic tumors.

However, elevated CA19-9 does not always indicate the presence of malignant tumors. Benign cholestasis, such as pancreatitis, gallstones, cholangitis, chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, can also lead to an increase in CA19-9. Elevated CA19-9 can also be observed in AIP, with 27.0–44.0% of AIP patients exhibiting elevated CA19-9 levels. In such cases, identifying AIP as a benign pancreatic lesion can be challenging, especially when there is focal enlargement of the pancreatic head.

In benign biliary obstructive diseases, a correlation exists between serum bilirubin and CA19-9 levels, likely attributed to the disordered excretion of CA19-9. Cholestasis is quite common in AIP and painless obstructive jaundice is the most prevalent symptom. In AIP patients of the current study, 94.29% (33/35) exhibited elevated DBil. Therefore, the present study introduced the ratio of CA19-9 to bilirubin to minimize the impact of cholestasis on CA19-9. In theory, DBil is considered to more accurately reflect the degree of cholestasis compared to TBil, as Tbil includes indirect bilirubin (IBil) and IBil is susceptible to the effects of hemolysis and genetic abnormalities in bilirubin metabolism, such as Gilbert syndrome. Hence, this study opted for DBil over TBil.

### Refractory obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis: a new endoscopic approach [^3fff4e9b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Liver involvement, including elevated direct-reacting bilirubin levels, is common in patients with sickle cell disease. Fifty to seventy percent of sickle cell patients have pigmented gallstones due to precipitation of unconjugated bilirubin, and cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis are common complications. The highest prevalence of these complications occurs in patients with Gilbert's syndrome because of the combined effect of increased bilirubin production and reduced bilirubin-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activity. Cholelithiasis is also a common complication in patients with thalassemia. Endoscopic removal of choledochal stones does not always resolve the clinical picture, as in cases of dysfunction of the Vater's papilla, increased bile density due to persistently impaired bile flow or distortion of the choledocus due to dilatation, or inflammation secondary to gallstone.

Case Presentation

We report here a case of severe and persistent obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis and Gilbert's syndrome, previously, and unsuccessfully, treated with endoscopic removal of choledochal stones. Deep and thorough biliary washing, and stenting with a new removable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered flared-type stent led to complete resolution of the obstructive jaundice.

Conclusions

This report shows that an aggressive endoscopic approach in this select category of patients can help resolve the severe complication of hemolytic anemia, thus avoiding surgery.

### Liver enzyme elevations inVolunteer infection studies: findings and recommendations [^760aeea6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential for severe DILI (Hy's law).

To investigate the potential for severe liver injury as defined by Hy's law, an evaluation of drug-induced serious hepatotoxicity (E-DISH) plot of ALT versus bilirubin relative to the ULN and a modified E-DISH plot (M-DISH) of changes in ALT and bilirubin relative to baseline was performed (Figure 3). Across the IBSM studies, there was one potential Hy's law case (participant 5103; Study QP15C01; cipargamin–piperaquine) (Figure 3). This 52-year-old man had an undisclosed history of alcohol abuse, and a fatty liver and gallstones observed on ultrasound examination, performed after the ALT/AST elevations were identified. Baseline values (day 8) were mildly elevated for total and conjugated bilirubin (1.4 × ULN and 1.3 × ULN), ALT (1.1 × ULN), and gamma glutamyl transferase (γGT) (1.5 × ULN). Peak elevations in ALT/AST were not observed until 9 days after cipargamin administration and 1 day after piperaquine: AST 2.6 × ULN, ALT 4.7 × ULN, and bilirubin 3.7 × ULN. The participant received two 1-g acetaminophen doses before peak ALT/AST. Total bilirubin mostly comprised unconjugated bilirubin. This was not suggestive of global liver function loss and inconsistent with DILI, being more likely explained by hemolysis or impaired bilirubin conjugation, as seen with Gilbert's syndrome. Subsequently, plasma miR-122 levels were assessed in all eight cohort participants; correlation between miR-122 and ALT profiles may reflect hepatocyte leakage or active release as a major cause for ALT elevations. In this case, the miR-122 profile did not match ALT, suggesting that bilirubin elevation was probably not caused by hepatocyte injury. It was not possible to determine the mechanism underlying the liver function test abnormalities. Drug-induced liver injury expert review did not consider this a Hy's law case because of the bilirubin profile and history of alcohol abuse, and although a contribution for cipargamin–piperaquine could not be excluded, the cause was likely multifactorial.

Biliary atresia (BA) evaluation — imaging and histology recommendations: Abdominal ultrasound is described as useful to exclude choledochal cyst or gallstone disease causing extrahepatic bile duct obstruction and may show an absent or abnormal gallbladder or other features suggestive, but not diagnostic, of BA (1A); limited specificity precludes the use of the hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) scan as a stand‑alone test for definitive BA diagnosis (1B), though definitively demonstrated bile flow by selective HBS may help exclude BA (1B); limited specificity of MRCP, ERCP, and PTCC provides only a limited role in guiding diagnosis of BA; and, in the hands of an experienced pediatric pathologist, characteristic histopathologic changes on an appropriately timed liver biopsy are the most supportive test for infants with protracted conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (1B), while histology can identify other cholestatic diseases.

### Bilirubin correlation may preclude MRCP in acute cholecystitis patients with normal common bile duct diameter [^284786f9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. In patients with acute cholecystitis (AC), accurate identification of a common bile duct (CBD) stone before cholecystectomy is of concern for surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. This study evaluates the utility of preoperative MRCP taking into consideration both sonographic findings and biochemical predictors for choledocholithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Fifty-seven patients (58% women; mean age, 54 years old) with signs of AC on right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound (US) who underwent subsequent MRCP from 2007 to 2017 were identified using a text-based search and retrospectively analyzed, using ERCP as the reference standard. RESULTS. For patients with AC who had a normal CBD diameter on initial RUQ US, we found a significant difference in the total and direct bilirubin levels of patients who had positive (1.94 vs 4.02 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.013) and negative (0.71 vs 2.13 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.02) findings for CBD stone on MRCP. ROC curve analysis showed an increased total bilirubin threshold of > 2.3 mg/dL (standard threshold, 1.2 mg/dL), which yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95%. An increased direct bilirubin threshold of > 0.9 mg/dL (standard threshold, 0.2 mg/dL) yielded an NPV of 100%. CONCLUSION. In patients with AC who have a normal CBD diameter on RUQ US, normal or even mildly elevated bilirubin levels below a calculated threshold may obviate preoperative MRCP. Radiologists should be active participants in clinical decision-making; discussion between referring physicians and radiologists regarding biochemical markers and sonographic findings will lead to more appropriate use of preoperative imaging.

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^bb3d623f]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar pain in the abdomen. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

Investigations

History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

Diagnosis

Choledocholithiasis.

Management

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### Yellow urticaria and biliary pancreatitis [^1504371b]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cases in the literature indicate that patients with yellow urticaria had an underlying predisposition to hives that was not secondary to deposits of bilirubin in the skin. The yellowness of the wheals was attributed to underlying hyperbilirubinemia with skin deposits. In this case, the patient denied previous urticarial history, and, at physical inspection, she presented with slight jaundice that was considerably lighter than the urticarial lesions. We hypothesized that increased vasopermeability and subsequent plasma extravasation led to increased skin deposits, resulting in distinctly yellow lesions that appeared dissimilar to the surrounding skin. Additionally, because blood flow is diminished secondary to dermal edema, a fainter red hue was produced, as was a yellowing because of the bilirubin.

Bile salts can stimulate mast cells to release histamine. Thus, increased bile salts can stimulate wheals in patients with previous urticaria. Because our patient had no urticaria antecedent, it is possible that the elevated bilirubin level contributed to the urticaria, as there was no other identifiable cause. In addition, the patient did not experience a recurrence after the cholecystectomy. However, other possible mechanisms of urticaria development in our case may be related to the pathogenesis of pancreatitis.

Key factors implicated in the onset of biliary pancreatitis include ampullary obstruction by gallstones and activation of trypsinogen by enteric peptidases to trypsin. Trypsin is able to activate proteinase-activated receptors expressed in primary sensory neurons of the pancreas and mast cells. Protease-activated receptor 2 sensitizes transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. Primary sensory neurons in the pancreas express transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channels, activation of which induces pancreatic inflammation. In addition, transient receptor potential proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mast cell activation, promoting inflammatory mediator release. Thus, an increase in trypsin concentration during pancreatitis might have contributed to the development of urticaria in this patient.

On the other hand, however, the mechanisms that triggered urticaria and angioedema may have been involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis in this case. The literature described this association in a woman in her sixth postpartum week; she experienced urticaria and 24 hours later manifested an episode of acute pancreatitis. Moreover, skin swellings like hereditary angioedema are able to induce acute pancreatitis secondary to C1 inhibitor deficiencyleading to unregulated generation of bradykinin. This increases vascular permeability into pancreatic tissue.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia [^5ef81bf9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Jaundice, the physical finding associated with hyperbilirubinemia, results when the liver is unable to properly metabolize or excrete bilirubin. The purpose of this review is to examine some of the most common causes of jaundice in adults, provide insight into the diagnostic evaluation of jaundice, and review information on the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Recent Findings

An elevated level of bilirubin almost always indicates the presence of an underlying disease state. The best approach to evaluating a patient with jaundice is to start with a careful history and physical examination, followed by imaging assessment of the biliary tree and liver. There are algorithm models that incorporate bilirubin levels in their predictor models for outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (i.e., the model for end-stage liver disease). However, there are few studies that have examined the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Summary

Evaluation of patients with jaundice starts with a careful history and physical examination, followed by directed imaging of the biliary tree and liver. Although jaundice is generally believed to be a serious medical condition, there is little literature that addresses outcomes in patients with jaundice.

### Early cholecystectomy for mild to moderate gallstone pancreatitis shortens hospital stay [^7884fd31]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis remains controversial. We hypothesized that in patients with mild to moderate gallstone pancreatitis (three or fewer Ranson's criteria), performing early cholecystectomy before resolution of laboratory or physical examination abnormalities would result in shorter hospitalization, without adversely affecting outcomes.

Study Design

An observational study consisting of a retrospective and a prospective group was conducted. For the prospective group, a deliberate policy of early cholecystectomy (less than 48 hours from admission) was used. The primary end point was total length of hospital stay. Secondary endpoints were time from admission to definitive operation, need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and major complications (organ failure and death).

Results

Group I consisted of 177 patients retrospectively reviewed, and Group II was composed of 43 patients prospectively followed. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to demographics. With respect to admission laboratory values, there was a significant difference in median serum amylase, but there were no differences in median serum levels of lipase, total bilirubin, albumin, white blood cell count, or Ranson's score. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days in Group I versus 4 days in Group II (p = or < 0.001). Median time from admission to cholecystectomy was 5 days in Group I versus 2 days in Group II (p = or < 0.0001). Complication rates were similar and there were no deaths in either group.

Conclusions

In patients with mild to moderate gallstone pancreatitis, a policy of early cholecystectomy resulted in a significantly reduced length of hospital stay with no increase in complications or mortality.

### Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones [^c9bb5180]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasound and liver function tests (serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase) are used as screening tests for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. There has been no systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests.

Objectives

To determine and compare the accuracy of ultrasound versus liver function tests for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and Clinicaltrials.gov to September 2012. We searched the references of included studies to identify further studies and systematic reviews identified from various databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, Medion, and ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility)). We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ultrasound, serum bilirubin, or serum alkaline phosphatase. We only accepted studies that confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction of the stones (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test result, and absence of common bile duct stones by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months for a negative test result as the reference standard in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. We included participants with or without prior diagnosis of cholelithiasis; with or without symptoms and complications of common bile duct stones, with or without prior treatment for common bile duct stones; and before or after cholecystectomy. At least two authors screened abstracts and selected studies for inclusion independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected data from each study. Where meta-analysis was possible, we used the bivariate model to summarise sensitivity and specificity.

Main Results

Five studies including 523 participants reported the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound. One studies (262 participants) compared the accuracy of ultrasound, serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase in the same participants. All the studies included people with symptoms. One study included only participants without previous cholecystectomy but this information was not available from the remaining studies. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. The sensitivities for ultrasound ranged from 0.32 to 1.00, and the specificities ranged from 0.77 to 0.97. The summary sensitivity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90) and the specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.95). At the median pre-test probability of common bile duct stones of 0.408, the post-test probability (95% CI) associated with positive ultrasound tests was 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.91), and negative ultrasound tests was 0.17 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.33). The single study of liver function tests reported diagnostic accuracy at two cut-offs for bilirubin (greater than 22.23 μmol/L and greater than twice the normal limit) and two cut-offs for alkaline phosphatase (greater than 125 IU/L and greater than twice the normal limit). This study also assessed ultrasound and reported higher sensitivities for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase at both cut-offs but the specificities of the markers were higher at only the greater than twice the normal limit cut-off. The sensitivity for ultrasound was 0.32 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.54), bilirubin (cut-off greater than 22.23 μmol/L) was 0.84 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.95), and alkaline phosphatase (cut-off greater than 125 IU/L) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99). The specificity for ultrasound was 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97), bilirubin (cut-off greater than 22.23 μmol/L) was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94), and alkaline phosphatase (cut-off greater than 125 IU/L) was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). No study reported the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, or combinations with ultrasound.

Authors' Conclusions

Many people may have common bile duct stones in spite of having a negative ultrasound or liver function test. Such people may have to be re-tested with other modalities if the clinical suspicion of common bile duct stones is very high because of their symptoms. False-positive results are also possible and further non-invasive testing is recommended to confirm common bile duct stones to avoid the risks of invasive testing. It should be noted that these results were based on few studies of poor methodological quality and the results for ultrasound varied considerably between studies. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies of high methodological quality are necessary to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests.

### Acalculous variant of mirizzi syndrome: imaging and clinical characteristics [^f4e20c0c]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mirizzi Syndrome is a rare disease that causes biliary obstruction in the setting of an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck or Hartmann's Pouch which exerts mass effect on the common duct; however, we have noticed inflammatory biliary narrowing in the absence of an offending gallstone in the setting of acute cholecystitis. The purpose of this study is to report the clinical and MRCP findings in a series of 10 patients with this variant of Mirizzi Syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A search of our institution's PACS and electronic medical record identified 10 patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and narrowing of the common duct on imaging in the absence of an impacted gallstone. Imaging and clinical findings were confirmed by two board-certified abdominal radiologists.

Results

All patients presented with abdominal pain and an average elevated total bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dL. Seven patients had MRCP findings of complete narrowing of the CBD. Nine patients had intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. All nine patients with gadoliniumenhanced MRCP displayed biliary wall thickening with enhancement adjacent to the gallbladder. Nine patients underwent cholecystectomy, one patient underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy. Average bilirubin upon discharge was within normal limits at 0.9 mg/dL after intervention. Two patients had follow-up MRCP showing resolution of biliary narrowing.

Conclusion

A variant of Mirizzi Syndrome occurs in the absence of an offending gallstone in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct to explain the biliary narrowing. We postulate that acute cholecystitis can cause a local inflammatory narrowing resulting in biliary obstruction.

### Acute hepatitis E virus infection presenting as a prolonged cholestatic jaundice [^f16373f8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric virus that usually causes a self-resolving hepatitis; although, it may be fatal, especially in pregnant women. Although HEV is endemic in Israel, there have been no recent local outbreaks. We report the case of a 70-year-old man who presented with painless jaundice. Ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan revealed gallstones, with no evidence of cholecystitis and no dilatation of the intra-or extrahepatic bile ducts. An open cholecystectomy was performed with intraoperative cholangiography. There was no evidence of choledocholithiasis. A subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was normal. His bilirubin level subsequently increased to a maximum of 25 mg/dL, and his gamma-glutamyl-transferase level reached 1,400 U/L. There was no evidence of any autoimmune or metabolic disease, and routine viral serology was normal except for immunoglobulin G to hepatitis A virus. A liver biopsy revealed an acute cholestatic picture. The jaundice resolved slowly after a period of 6 months. Hepatitis E virus RNA was isolated from the acute-phase serum and was not detectable in the convalescent serum. This case is a unique example of chronic cholestatic jaundice that we think is caused by acute HEV infection.

### Chenodiol (Ctexli) [^28d2a216]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels in all patients and monitor yearly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment until the levels have returned to baseline values. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI. (5.1)

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Chenodiol, including CTEXLI, has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Trial 1, one CTEXLI-treated patient (7%) had increased ALT levels > 3 times ULN, which led to treatment interruption. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity during treatment with CTEXLI. Published reports suggest patients who are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid are more likely to develop chenodiol-induced serum aminotransferase elevations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain baseline liver transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels in all patients prior to treatment initiation with CTEXLI. If liver transaminase levels are elevated > 3 times ULN or total bilirubin level is > 2 times ULN, interrupt treatment with CTEXLI until the levels have returned to baseline values. Monitor liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels yearly and as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

Inform the patient of the symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., abdominal pain, bruising, dark-colored urine, fatigue, bleeding, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with hepatotoxicity occur, have the patient discontinue CTEXLI immediately.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^f2021846]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis and suspected biliary disease — magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): The CFF recommends that all PwCF who have cholestatic liver test elevation (Direct Bilirubin, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase), abdominal pain consistent with a biliary cause, and inconclusive abdominal US should undergo magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to detect hepatolithiasis, choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, and/or biliary obstruction; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography imaging is superior to US for assessment of the biliary tree, and therefore in PwCF with concerning findings without adequate explanation by US, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be obtained to help guide therapeutic decisions.

### Predictors of gallstone composition in 1025 symptomatic gallstones from Northern Germany [^d671825d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones represent a prevalent and costly health problem. The changing epidemiology and the emerging non-surgical interventions for gallstone disease necessitate the definition of target populations for future therapies. This study aimed to define patterns of gallstone composition and identify demographic predictors of gallstone composition in a large sample of symptomatic gallstones from Northern Germany.

Methods

One thousand and seventy-four post-cholecystectomy gallstone specimens were obtained. Demographic and clinical information was provided by questionnaire (N = 1025 independent individuals with complete information). Two samples from each gallstone were analyzed using Fourier transformed infrared spectrometry.

Results

The most prevalent substance was cholesterol, which was detected in 95.0% of gallstone specimens. Bilirubin and bilirubinate were present in 30.0% and calcium was detected in 10.0% of the spectra. Ninety-two percent of measurements from the same stone yielded the same "main" substances, indicating a homogenous stone composition in most cases. Female sex and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with the presence of cholesterol as a main substance in the gallstones (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The changing epidemiology of gallstone disease is reflected by a marked shift in stone composition: Only two percent of stones in this study were pigment stones as compared to 91% percent of stones containing cholesterol as a main substance. Obese individuals from Germany with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 have in 95% cholesterol-dominant gallstones and represent a potential target population for non-surgical interventions for the prevention or treatment of cholesterol stones.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^df76d34d]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

In rare cases, there can be retrograde passage of gallstones into the common hepatic duct or the right or left main hepatic ducts, or stones can form in intrahepatic ducts due to biliary stasis.

If a gallstone passes down the common bile duct and comes to rest at the ampulla of Vater, it may block the drainage of the pancreatic duct causing back pressure on the pancreatic cells and resulting in gallstone pancreatitis. These patients present with epigastric pain radiating to the back and the severity ranges from mild to severe. There is a significant mortality associated with severe pancreatitis, and critically ill patients should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care monitored environment. While imaging is not usually required or indicated to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, an ultrasound of the gallbladder can confirm or rule out the presence of gallstones. CT abdomen/pelvis is best performed 48 h after the onset of symptoms to assess for complications of pancreatitis such as peripancreatic collections or pancreatic necrosis (Fig. 20).

Fig. 20

In general, larger gallstones are more likely to obstruct higher in the common bile duct, and as such are more likely to cause obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. Smaller gallstones are more likely to cause pancreatitis as they more freely pass down to the level of the ampulla of Vater.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^acd69367]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis pre-test probability — clinical and imaging predictors are as follows: On abdominal ultrasound, visualization of a common bile duct stone carries approximately a 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Strong predictors include clinical evidence of acute cholangitis, a bilirubin greater than 1.7 mg/dL and a dilated common bile duct (CBD), and the presence of two or more of these factors has a pre-test probability of 50%-94% for choledocholithiasis (considered high). Patients without evidence of jaundice and a normal bile duct on ultrasound have a low probability of choledocholithiasis (< 5%), and patients that fall between these two spectrums are categorized as having an intermediate probability of choledocholithiasis. Meta-analyses have found an observed superiority in the sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as compared to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) due to better accuracy for small stones, and EUS-directed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been advocated as a cost-effective method since both EUS and ERCP could be performed in the same session; the algorithm presented in Fig. 1 may be helpful for managing patients with suspected choledocholithiasis dependent on their risk stratification.

### Outcome of endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with pain of suspected biliary or papillary origin and inconclusive cholangiography findings [^4aea1294]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

We prospectively studied the outcome of endoscopic sphincterotomy in symptomatic patients with elevated liver enzyme levels but no clear evidence of biliary pathology on transabdominal ultrasound and diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC).

Methods

29 consecutive patients with biliary-type pain (two or more out of eight criteria), elevated liver enzyme levels and no evidence of gallstones or significant common bile duct dilatation were evaluated. Elevated bilirubin levels (up to 7.2 mg/dl) were found in 18 patients. The majority of patients (n = 21) had a gallbladder in situ. The findings from bile duct exploration following sphincterotomy were recorded, and pain (as measured by visual analogue scale) as well as laboratory findings was assessed.

Results

Wire-guided sphincterotomy was successful in all patients while uncomplicated pancreatitis occurred in one instance. In 16 patients (55%) there was macroscopic evidence of small stones (n = 2), sludge (n = 12) or both (n = 2) following bile duct exploration. In addition, microscopy showed bile crystals in all four patients who had no macroscopic findings. All four patients with elevation of pancreatic enzymes prior to treatment, and four of those eight patients with previous cholecystectomy, showed evidence of biliary pathology. The initial median pain intensity was 8 (range 1–10); 26 patients became pain-free within 3 months following endoscopic sphincterotomy. While 26 of 28 patients (93%) remained asymptomatic over a median follow-up period of 19 months (range 12–26), one died of an unrelated malignancy 6 months after therapy.

Conclusions

Endoscopic sphincterotomy may be acceptable in patients with typical clinical presentation suggesting a papillary or biliary origin of pain without further diagnostic work-up. Contrary to expectations, diagnostic ERC was insensitive in detection of the biliary etiology of symptoms in this selected group of patients.

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^14e4b8e1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^86a0ebb7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^d69f9e2a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for underlying cause, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain serum triglyceride and calcium levels in patients with acute pancreatitis in the absence of gallstones or significant history of alcohol use. Recognize that serum triglyceride levels > 11.3 mmol/L (1,000 mg/dL) indicate it as the etiology.
