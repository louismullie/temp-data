## Question

Labs for epigastric pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory testing for epigastric pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the core laboratory panel for undifferentiated epigastric pain. Next, I will examine disease-specific labs such as pancreatitis enzymes, hepatobiliary markers, and H. pylori testing. After that, I need to consider special populations and alarm features that modify testing. Finally, I will integrate imaging decisions and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and follow-up plans, ensuring I anchor each step to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic stability come before any labs, and I need to screen for life-threatening causes that can masquerade as epigastric pain, including myocardial ischemia, perforated viscus, and mesenteric ischemia, because missing these carries high morbidity and mortality. I should not jump to conclusions about gastrointestinal etiologies until these are reasonably excluded based on history, exam, and targeted testing such as high-sensitivity troponin when cardiac ischemia is suspected, especially in older adults or those with risk factors [^111jUMNZ] [^114mMZtU].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory panel for undifferentiated epigastric pain. A reasonable baseline includes a complete blood count to assess for infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel for electrolytes, renal function, and glucose, liver function tests with AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin to screen for hepatobiliary disease, and urinalysis to evaluate for urinary sources. I need to ensure I add a pregnancy test in all patients with female reproductive potential because ectopic pregnancy remains a critical differential. This panel aligns with contemporary primary care and emergency medicine guidance for acute abdominal pain and dyspepsia workups [^112BidjC] [^116BE929].

> Hold on, I should verify the pancreatitis testing strategy. Serum lipase is preferred over amylase because it is more specific and remains elevated longer. The diagnostic threshold is at least three times the upper limit of normal, and diagnosis requires two of three: characteristic epigastric pain radiating to the back, lipase or amylase greater than three times the ULN, or characteristic imaging findings. I initially thought amylase might be equally useful, but wait, let me reconsider — multiple high-quality guidelines favor lipase due to better diagnostic performance, so I should prioritize lipase and avoid relying on amylase alone [^111nkKSU] [^111wfzKF] [^1168pqk1].

> I will now examine hepatobiliary markers more closely. Elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin support biliary colic or cholecystitis, and in the right clinical context, a cholestatic pattern with disproportionate ALP and bilirubin elevation raises concern for obstruction. But wait, I should double-check that no single lab rules in or out acute cholecystitis; diagnosis relies on combining history, exam, labs, and imaging, with ultrasound as first-line for suspected biliary disease. This integrated approach is emphasized by WSES and supported by diagnostic accuracy studies of ultrasound and clinical features [^1165emXK] [^1165emXK].

> Let me consider H. pylori testing in dyspepsia. In patients under 60 without alarm features, a noninvasive test-and-treat strategy is recommended, using urea breath test or stool antigen rather than serology, which lacks specificity. I should confirm eradication only in patients at higher risk for gastric cancer or if symptoms persist after appropriate therapy. This approach is supported by ACG and BSG guidelines and reduces unnecessary endoscopy while addressing a common cause of epigastric pain [^111aULg4] [^116mn4HY].

> Next, I should review alarm features that modify testing. Weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, or a family history of upper GI malignancy should lower my threshold for endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. In patients aged 60 or older with abdominal pain and weight loss, urgent CT is advised to exclude pancreatic cancer, and in those 55 or older with dyspepsia and weight loss, urgent endoscopy is recommended. I need to ensure I document these red flags explicitly because they shift pretest probabilities and guide escalation [^116mn4HY] [^114kiKKi].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population. In pregnancy, I should avoid radiation when possible and favor ultrasound or MRI if imaging is needed, and I must maintain a high suspicion for obstetric etiologies. In older adults, presentations are often atypical, so I should have a lower threshold for imaging and admission. In children, I should apply pediatric-specific pathways and consider hereditary pancreatitis when enzymes are markedly elevated with supportive family history. In immunocompromised hosts, I must broaden the differential and maintain vigilance for atypical infections and perforations [^112BidjC] [^117Y27Ar] [^115JAmDF].

> I need to check the role of inflammatory markers. CRP can support an inflammatory process but is nonspecific; it may help in appendicitis, cholecystitis, or diverticulitis but should not be used in isolation. Likewise, a normal CRP does not exclude serious disease, so I should interpret it alongside the clinical picture and other labs rather than as a standalone rule-out test [^1165emXK] [^112BidjC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm that imaging is chosen based on pain location and suspected etiology. Ultrasound is first-line for right upper quadrant or epigastric pain suggesting biliary disease, whereas CT is preferred for undifferentiated lower abdominal pain or when serious pathology is suspected. Early CT in pancreatitis is generally not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient fails to improve, given limited impact on management and radiation exposure. This balances diagnostic yield with safety and stewardship [^117PDmzo] [^111nkKSU].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Start with history, exam, and vitals to identify red flags and immediate threats. Order CBC, BMP, LFTs, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test when applicable. Add lipase if pancreatitis is suspected. Consider H. pylori testing in appropriate dyspepsia phenotypes. Escalate to targeted imaging based on location and suspicion, and proceed to endoscopy or CT when alarm features are present or symptoms persist despite initial management. Throughout, reassess frequently and document evolution, because early benign presentations can evolve into serious disease [^112BidjC] [^116mn4HY].

> Finally, I should double-check limitations and follow-up. A normal CT does not exclude important upper abdominal pathology, with a reported negative predictive value around 64% in undifferentiated upper abdominal pain, so clinical correlation is essential. For low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain after appropriate prior workup, GRACE-2 supports selective testing and shared decision-making to avoid unnecessary radiation and low-yield repetition. I need to ensure return precautions and close follow-up are explicit when discharging patients without a definitive diagnosis [^114jhFmi] [^1166LKz4].

For epigastric pain, order **CBC, CMP, lipase, and pregnancy test** [^112BidjC] to screen for common causes and complications. Add **LFTs, bilirubin, and ALP** if biliary disease is suspected [^1165emXK], and **troponin** if cardiac ischemia is a concern [^114mMZtU]. Use **H. pylori testing** for dyspepsia without alarm features [^116v4nbG], and reserve **amylase** only if lipase is unavailable or to assess persistent elevations [^1168pqk1]. Routine labs guide urgency and imaging but rarely confirm a specific diagnosis; interpret results in clinical context and escalate to imaging or endoscopy when indicated [^111jUMNZ].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

### Complete blood count (CBC)

The CBC evaluates for **anemia, infection, or inflammation** — anemia may indicate GI bleeding from peptic ulcer disease or malignancy; leukocytosis suggests infection or inflammation (e.g. pancreatitis, cholecystitis); and thrombocytosis can be a marker of malignancy or chronic inflammation [^116mn4HY].

---

### Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)

The CMP assesses **electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes** — electrolyte disturbances may reflect vomiting, diarrhea, or metabolic derangements; renal function helps evaluate dehydration or renal involvement; and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) screen for hepatobiliary disease (e.g. hepatitis, cholestasis, biliary obstruction) [^1114f7Hp].

---

### Serum lipase and amylase

Serum lipase is the **preferred test** for acute pancreatitis, with higher specificity than amylase; a level > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is diagnostic when combined with compatible symptoms [^111nkKSU]. Amylase is less specific and may be elevated in non-pancreatic conditions; consider only if lipase is unavailable or to evaluate persistent elevations [^1168pqk1].

---

### Pregnancy test

A **urine or serum β-hCG** is essential in women of reproductive age to exclude pregnancy-related complications (e.g. ectopic pregnancy) [^112BidjC].

---

## Additional laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Biliary disease (cholecystitis, cholangitis) | - LFTs (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) <br/> - Bilirubin (total and direct) <br/> - CRP/ESR [^1114f7Hp] |
| Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) | - H. pylori testing (urea breath test or stool antigen) [^116v4nbG] |
| Cardiac ischemia | - High-sensitivity troponin [^notfound] |
| Liver disease | - LFTs <br/> - PT/INR <br/> - Albumin <br/> - Globulin [^notfound] |
| Renal colic | - Urinalysis <br/> - Serum calcium <br/> - Uric acid [^notfound] |

---

## Laboratory tests with limited utility

- **Serum amylase**: Less specific than lipase; avoid as a standalone test for pancreatitis [^1168pqk1].
- **Routine coagulation profile**: Not indicated unless liver disease or anticoagulation is suspected.
- **Serum lactate**: Consider only if mesenteric ischemia is suspected.

---

## Interpretation of laboratory results

- **Normal results**: Do not exclude serious disease; interpret in clinical context [^117Bi8y8].
- **Abnormal results**: Guide further evaluation (e.g. imaging, endoscopy) [^117PDmzo].
- **Trends**: Serial assessments can clarify evolving conditions (e.g. pancreatitis, biliary obstruction).

---

## Limitations of laboratory testing

Laboratory testing has **limited specificity**, as abnormal results are often nonspecific and require clinical correlation. False positives/negatives occur, and results may be affected by assay variability or patient factors. Testing alone rarely confirms a diagnosis; imaging or endoscopy is often required [^111jUMNZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACG 2024**: Diagnose acute pancreatitis with ≥ 2 of: characteristic pain, lipase/amylase > 3× ULN, or imaging findings [^111nkKSU].
- **BSG 2022**: Use H. pylori test-and-treat for dyspepsia without alarm features; reserve endoscopy for alarm symptoms [^116mn4HY].
- **GRACE-2**: For low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain, avoid routine labs; tailor testing to prior workup and clinical context [^1166LKz4].

---

## Conclusion

A **targeted laboratory approach** — CBC, CMP, lipase, and pregnancy test — is foundational for epigastric pain. Add LFTs, bilirubin, ALP, troponin, or H. pylori testing based on suspicion. Labs guide urgency and imaging but rarely confirm a diagnosis; interpret results in clinical context and escalate to imaging or endoscopy when indicated [^112BidjC].

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (eg, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are of necessity related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^113hMxVS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymaemia is not specific for acute pancreatitis, occurring in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. Where persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs in the absence of a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before a diagnosis of benign pancreatic hyperenzymaemia can be made. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Which test for Helicobacter pylori in primary care? [^1153aZz2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Around 4% of primary care consultations are for dyspepsia, a term used for a specific group of upper gastrointestinal symptoms that includes abdominal discomfort, recurrent epigastric pain, bloating and heartburn. National guidelines recommend testing patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia for Helicobacter pylori infection, giving eradication therapy to those found to be infected and re-testing those who remain symptomatic after such treatment. Non-invasive tests for H. pylori avoid the need for endoscopy and biopsy to confirm infection, and several are now available for use in primary care. Here we review these tests and consider their role in the management of adults with dyspepsia.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### A 53-year-old man with persistent epigastric pain [^113YcB5U]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 53-year-old man who had epigastric pain that he described as a sensation of burning behind his sternum. It persisted for months despite treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery: Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis" for acute pancreatitis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for some variability in clinical presentation.

This tool helps determine if the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met. It guides users through selecting relevant clinical features and automatically evaluates these selections.

Here's how the process unfolds:

Diagnosis hinges on three critical indicators:

- Abdominal pain is described as acute, persistent, severe, and primarily in the epigastric region, typically extending to the back.
- Levels of the enzymes lipase or amylase are three times higher than the normal maximum.
- Imaging via CT or MRI shows findings characteristic of pancreatitis.

Using these criteria, the calculator assesses whether the combination of any two of these factors is present:

- If the abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels are reported, or
- If elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings are observed, or
- If abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings are noted.

The diagnostic conclusion is simple:

- If any two out of the three key indicators coincide, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met.
- If fewer than two criteria are present, the criteria are not satisfied.

This straightforward evaluation ensures users can easily understand if the combination of clinical symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1166LKz4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^112EkvBr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) currently requires fulfilling at least 2 of 3 criteria: (1) characteristic abdominal pain, (2) serum lipase (or amylase) levels elevated to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal (or reference range) (ULN), and (3) characteristic findings on imaging, typically abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While 90% of patients fulfill symptom and laboratory criteria at presentation and therefore do not require imaging confirmation, early imaging remains overused.

To address this limitation, a prediction model and corresponding point-based score were previously developed to diagnose AP in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected AP, defined as serum lipase levels of at least 3 times the ULN. This model used 8 nonimaging parameters found to be most associated with AP, each readily ascertainable at presentation: 1 laboratory variable (initial serum lipase level), 3 variables pertaining to medical history (number of prior AP episodes, prior cholelithiasis, or recent abdominal surgery), and 4 variables characterizing abdominal pain (pain localized to the epigastrium, pain of worsening severity, duration from pain onset to presentation, and pain level at ED presentation).

While the model demonstrated excellent discriminatory accuracy for AP in a retrospective cohort, it has not been prospectively validated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the prediction model to diagnose AP when applied to a prospective cohort of patients.

### A UK population-based case-control study of blood tests before cancer diagnosis in patients with non-specific abdominal symptoms [^1124Jy1U]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with cancer are diagnosed after presenting with symptoms to primary care. Approximately half of these patients have well recognised 'red flag' symptoms, which align with existing international urgent cancer referral pathways to support faster diagnosis and treatment. The other half of patients pose a diagnostic challenge. They present with non-specific symptoms that overlap with many commonly encountered, often benign, conditions, making their cancer hard to identify early. These patients frequently experience complex care pathways, with multiple consultations and investigations before their cancer is eventually detected. They are therefore more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer and via emergency presentations, which are associated with poorer outcomes and worse patient experience.

Two non-specific symptoms that present a particular dilemma for general practitioners (GPs) are abdominal pain and bloating. These symptoms are commonly encountered in the population, with one in three people experiencing bloating in the last 30 days and one in five having abdominal pain, and many of these patients will present to primary care (abdominal symptoms have been reported to feature in 10% of adult primary care consultations). For the most part, these symptoms are attributable to a wide range of largely benign causes, but in a small proportion of patients they represent presenting features of cancer of different sites. Research is needed to understand if opportunities for earlier diagnosis exist in cancer patients who present with these symptoms and how these patients can be better identified in primary care. Such information could improve earlier-stage cancer diagnosis, survival and patient outcomes.

Examining commonly used blood tests could reveal potential opportunities for earlier cancer diagnosis. Primary care requests for several blood tests, particularly acute phase reactants (APR), increase in the year before cancer diagnosis, with abnormal results (values occurring outside standard laboratory reference ranges for the population) occurring several months before cancer diagnosis for a number of blood tests and cancer sites. Abnormalities in these blood tests may be early signals or predictors of some cancers. In patients presenting to primary care with weight loss, another non-specific symptom, blood test abnormalities were predictive of as-yet-undetected cancer and could potentially help GPs to identify the subgroup of patients who should be prioritised for further cancer investigation. The discriminative value of abnormal blood tests in identifying patients with abdominal pain or bloating who warrant further investigation for possible cancer remains unclear.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^111nkKSU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### The NSW pathology atlas of variation: part I-identifying emergency departments with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices [^116TPcPJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Abdominal pain and chest pain are leading reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations, with laboratory tests frequently ordered to aid the diagnostic process. Our study aims to identify EDs with outlying laboratory ordering practices for patients presenting with undifferentiated abdominal pain and chest pain.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational study of 519,597 patients who presented with the complaint of abdominal or chest pain at 44 major hospital EDs across New South Wales, Australia, from January 2017 to September 2018. For each condition, we evaluated the risk-adjusted rate of ordering at least 1 laboratory test and of each of the top 15 ordered tests. We used funnel plots to graph variations in test ordering and identify EDs with outlying test-ordering practices. EDs lying above or below the 99.8% funnel control limits were regarded as outliers.

Results

From 3,360,152 unplanned presentations, abdominal pain and chest pain represented 8.8% (n = 296,809) and 6.6% (n = 222,788) of all cases, respectively. No major outliers were observed for ordering at least one laboratory test; however, variations were observed for individual tests. For abdominal pain, the top 3 tests with the highest ordering variation included glucose (20 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (10 outliers), and calcium-magnesium-phosphate (7 outliers). For chest pain, the top 3 tests with the highest ordering variation were glucose (21 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (17 outliers), and liver function test (14 outliers).

Conclusion

Identifying EDs with outlying laboratory-ordering practices is the first step in initiating context-specific evaluation of whether outlying variations are unwarranted.

### Clinical measurement of gastrointestinal motility and function: who, when and which test? [^114CjpTM]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Symptoms related to abnormal gastrointestinal motility and function are common. Oropharyngeal and oesophageal dysphagia, heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits are among the most frequent reasons for seeking medical attention from internists or general practitioners and are also common reasons for referral to gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons. However, the nonspecific nature of gastrointestinal symptoms, the absence of a definitive diagnosis on routine investigations (such as endoscopy, radiology or blood tests) and the lack of specific treatments make disease management challenging. Advances in technology have driven progress in the understanding of many of these conditions. This Review serves as an introduction to a series of Consensus Statements on the clinical measurements of gastrointestinal motility, function and sensitivity. A structured, evidence-based approach to the initial assessment and empirical treatment of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms is discussed, followed by an outline of the contribution of modern physiological measurement on the management of patients in whom the cause of symptoms has not been identified with other tests. Discussions include the indications for and utility of high-resolution manometry, ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring, gastric emptying studies, breath tests and investigations of anorectal structure and function in day-to-day practice and clinical management.

Clinical application of motility testing

- Before investigation of gastrointestinal motor function, mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease should be excluded.

Symptoms of gastrointestinal motor disorders are nonspecific: dysmotility cannot be differentiated from inflammatory or malignant disease on the basis of patient history alone. For example, epigastric pain, early satiety and abdominal fullness are typical symptoms of gastro paresis but can also be due to gastroduodenal ulcers or gastric cancer. Moreover, inflammatory diseases of the small and large bowel are associated with delayed gastric emptying, which can be reversible after treatment of inflammation. Thus, it is important to first exclude other aetiologies, in particular, mucosal and obstructive lesions, by appropriate investigations such as upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, imaging techniques and laboratory investigation. Such tests are mandatory in patients with 'red flags' (that is, weight loss, low haemoglobin levels and substantial episodes of vomiting) but should also be performed if the motility tests are invasive or symptoms are severe. In patients with moderate complaints and no alarm symptoms, noninvasive motility testing might be considered. The selection of tests will also be influenced by availability and the costs of diagnostic procedures in different health-care systems.

In general, motility investigations are usually limited to patients with relevant complaints that can be related to dysmotility and that markedly affect quality of life, nutrition, social function or work productivity and, rarely, to increased mortality. As with any diagnostic procedure, they are justified only if the results can be expected to influence clinical management.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116vXvgx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation

Diagnosing dyspepsia

Dyspepsia refers to a range of upper GI symptoms, including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and postprandial fullness. Patients presenting with these symptoms can be broadly thought of as belonging to one of three groups: those with uninvestigated dyspepsia, in whom investigation has yet to be performed in order to reveal the underlying diagnosis, those in whom investigation has revealed a specific organic or structural cause for their symptoms, and those where no organic cause is found and who are deemed to have functional dyspepsia (FD; Figure 1). Organic or structural causes of dyspeptic symptoms include chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and peptic ulcer disease, upper GI cancer, biliary and gallstone disease, and pancreatic disease, including pancreatic cancer. In such cases, patient management is disease-specific. The difficulty lies in identifying which patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia need to undergo further tests, as well as the management of those patients where investigation fails to reveal an underlying organic diagnosis, and who are therefore labelled as having FD.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Abdominal pain in special populations [^115JAmDF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of acute abdominal pain in special populations can be challenging for the emergency physician. This article focuses on two specific populations: patients with altered immunologic function and postprocedural patients. Recognition of life-threatening abdominal diseases may be delayed in immunosuppressed patients because of the atypical presentations of these conditions. In postprocedural patients, evaluation of acute abdominal symptoms requires an understanding of the complications of procedures often performed by others. The unique characteristics of abdominal pain in these two populations and, more specifically, which diseases to consider and how to use appropriate testing to detect life-threatening conditions, are discussed.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for efficient throughput of patients. Decision making in patients with abdominal pain on the basis of clinical and laboratory evaluation alone can result in unnecessary interventions or in delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, of which ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the most often used, can assist in clinical decision making. Imaging has been shown to have a positive effect on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, to lead to changes in decisions about management, and to increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of exposure to radiation in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has made available guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation of use of imaging with patient tailored guidelines may not be sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions, without exposing patients to unnecessary forms of imaging. Unfortunately, many of the studies on imaging for acute abdominal pain have evaluated investigations in isolation, and several show methodological shortcomings such as retrospective collection of data or differential verification of test results.

We evaluated the added value of plain radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography after clinical evaluation for making urgent diagnoses in patients presenting with abdominal pain. We compared the accuracy and costs of 11 diagnostic strategies, by using data systematically collected in a consecutive series of unselected patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain at the emergency department, all of whom were investigated with a structured overcomplete imaging protocol.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^114MmVDy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain who can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

Patients and Methods

A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients who were admitted to a surgical unit over a nine month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definite diagnosis was made or the patient's condition and abdominal pain improved and the patient discharged. The hospital where the study took place is a small peripheral general hospital draining a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

Results

There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding raised white cells count, tachycardia and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

Conclusion

Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, who have normal pulse rates and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention either medical or surgical.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^112RnCUw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The reliance on early imaging in AP may be attributed to limitations of the current diagnostic criteria. For example, how one defines characteristic abdominal pain remains subjective; higher serum lipase level cutoffs are known to have increased PPV; and CT and MRI are subject to differences in sensitivity and interobserver agreement. Notably, these 3 diagnostic criteria are weighted equally, yet few studies have compared their diagnostic performance to each other or as a group.

This novel prediction model improves on several of these limitations. First, it provides an objective framework for what constitutes characteristic abdominal pain, described initially as acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back. The model assigns points for not only epigastric pain but for shorter duration from pain onset to ED presentation (< 5 days) and higher pain scores. Pain radiating to the back was not found to be adequately predictive. Second, it assigns more points for elevations in serum lipase levels beyond at least 3 times the ULN, which are more specific for differentiating AP from nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia. Third, it incorporates perhaps the 2 most significant risk factors for AP: a history of AP or choledocholithiasis.

Patients and methods

Patients assessed at the emergency department at Rotorua Public Hospital with acute abdominal pain requiring admission to the surgical unit were enrolled in the prospective study.

Patients were examined by the admitting surgical team after taking a thorough history, Relevant points in the history included the patient's gender, duration of pain, site of pain, character of pain, fever, loss of appetite, change in bowel habit, vomiting, abdominal distension and urinary or genital symptoms.

Factors in the clinical examination that were considered of significant contribution to the final diagnosis included temperature, tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness and localized guarding.

Data was collected prospectively on an electronic database. Patients were followed up with further investigations that included ultrasound scan, CT scan and diagnostic laparotomy as was clinically indicated to ascertain the final diagnosis. All patients were admitted for observation or surgery if indicated.

Non-specific abdominal pain was defined as an abdominal pain in right iliac or hypogastric area lasting more than 6 hours and less than 8 days, without fever, leukocytosis, or obvious peritoneal signs and uncertain diagnosis after physical examination and baseline investigations including abdominal sonography; provide they have totally settled or underwent diagnostic laparoscopy that proved to be normal.

Analysis

Analysis was performed to evaluate the relative contribution and specificity of each individual factor to a definitive final diagnosis that led to identification those who had no definitive diagnosis. The data analyzed using SPSS ® version 10.5. Univariate analysis was performed using simple linear regression; multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

TABLE 1
Demographics of sampled ED visits.

CT scan rates increased consistently over time from 26.2% of all patients with abdominal pain visits receiving a CT scan in 2007 to 42.6% in 2019 (p < 0.001, Figure 1; Data S2). The relative percentage change in abdominal CT scans, calculated as the change each year compared to number of CTs in 2007, was greatest for older adults, with a 30.3% change from 2007 to 2019, compared to 24.0% change for adults aged 46 to 64 and 15.0% for adults aged 18 to 45 (p < 0.01 for all age groups, Data S3). From 2007 to 2012, only two variables were recorded for CT scans: head CT and nonhead CT. From 2013 to 2019, a third variable for abdominal CT was added, and 98% of the nonhead CT scans among patients with abdominal pain chief complaints were administered for the abdominal region, with 100% of abdominal CTs captured within the nonhead CT category.

Ultrasound use increased for all age groups from 2007 to 2019: 17.4% of abdominal pain visits for adults 18–45 years old received an ultrasound compared to 25.0% in 2019, 9.8% compared to 17.4% for ages 46–64, and 5.5% compared to 12.2% of adults 65+. X‐ray use decreased for the young and middle‐aged adults, by 46.2% and 25.2%, respectively, but remained more consistent for older adults, decreasing by 8.6%: 16.7% of the youngest adults received an X‐ray in 2007 compared to 9.0% in 2019, 31.3% compared to 23.4% for the middle‐aged adults, and 39.6% compared to 36.2% for older adults (Figure 2). Across all ages and all years, we found that only 3.6% of the visits were assigned diagnoses that would typically be found with imaging method other than CT (e.g. gastritis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, or melena). Additionally, 13% of older adult visits in 2019 received an X‐ray as their only imaging test (Data S4). Among those who received an X‐ray without CT scan or ultrasound, 0.5% had a kidney stone diagnosis and less than 0.01% had a gastronomy diagnosis (Data S5).

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^115GhGa4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression. The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, are unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated. During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy, but may not be cost-effective. Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^116mn4HY]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

We recommend that a full blood count is performed in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia and coeliac serology in all patients with FD and overlapping IBS-type symptoms (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that if no other upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs are reported, urgent endoscopy is only warranted in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with weight loss, or those aged > 40 years from an area at an increased risk of gastric cancer or with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that non-urgent endoscopy is considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that urgent abdominal CT scanning is considered in patients aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude pancreatic cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that all other patients with dyspepsia are offered non-invasive testing for H. pylori ('test and treat') and, if infected, given eradication therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).
We recommend that successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' is only confirmed in patients with an increased risk of gastric cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that patients without H. pylori infection are offered empirical acid suppression therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).

### Dyspepsia [^111wArcH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A variety of organic diseases can cause dyspepsia, but most patients with epigastric pain have functional dyspepsia. As dyspepsia is common and usually has a benign cause, it is not possible to fully investigate everyone with epigastric pain. Current recommendations suggest that young patients without alarm symptoms can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori test and treat and proton pump inhibitor therapy can be offered to those who are negative or remain symptomatic despite treatment for their H. pylori. Patients who remain symptomatic with this strategy may be investigated with endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia.

Recent Findings

There are a large number of trials for prokinetic therapy in functional dyspepsia, but treatment efficacy is uncertain, as there is evidence of publication bias. There are very limited data for the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants in functional dyspepsia. There has been recent interest in the observation that patients with functional dyspepsia have increased eosinophils in the duodenum and this may be accompanied by other subtle manifestations of upregulated mucosal immunity. It is possible that this is being driven by a dietary substance or by a change in the upper gut microbiome.

Summary

The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but how to manage those who do not respond is a challenge. Future studies evaluating diet and altering the gut microbiome may give clinicians more therapeutic options.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^116iGhZo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Question 1: diagnosis: which test for elderly

Diagnosis algorithms of acute cholecystitis are based on clinical picture, laboratory data, and imaging finding. Despite recent advances in non-invasive imaging in the last decades, there is still uncertainty in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients of all ages. Moreover, age-related changes involving pain perception, biliary tract physiology, and stress response to tissue injury may modify the clinical picture of ACC occurring in an elderly patient, making diagnosis even more complicated. Literature search identified approximately 70 publications on Embase and 140 on Medline.

Statement 1.1: There is no single investigation with sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude acute cholecystitis without further testing even in elderly people (LoE 2 GoR B). Combination of symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests results may have better diagnostic accuracy in confirming the diagnosis of ACC. (LoE 4 GoR D)

The most typical symptom of ACC is abdominal pain with a proportion of patients with right hypochondrial pain and epigastric pain of 72–93% in patients of all ages. Same range of 73–98% typical right hypochondrial and epigastric pain has been reported in studies focused on the elderly patients. Atypical pain or no pain at all has been associated with an acute cholecystitis in 12% and 5% of elderly people respectively. Vomiting has been reported in 38–48% of elderly patients in two studies. Abdominal tenderness or guarding was reported in 64.7% of patients over 65 years old in one study, while signs of peritonitis have been reported in 5.3–14.5% of elderly patients.

In one study, the rate of positive Murphy's sign in elderly people has been reported to be 43.3%. Another study reported a sensitivity of 0.48, specificity of 0.79, and a positive predictive value of 0.58 for Murphy's sign in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in the elderly. Fever has been reported in 36–74% of patients with ACC (8–10), but only 6.4% to 10% of patients with ACC had a temperature > 38 °C. Clinical features including pain, fever, abdominal defense, and vomiting have been compared in different age decades within elderly patients without finding any difference in old and very old patients. No study comparing the role of pain or other clinical features in young versus old patient has been found.

### Elevated lipase without pancreatitis in infectious colitis [^114eFvfL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An elevated lipase typically confirms the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated lipase may be associated with other disorders, typically with some influence on the pancreas. The differential is more limited than elevated amylase secondary to the mostly unique production of lipase in pancreatic acinar cells. Elevated lipase has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but not previously reported in infectious colitis.

Case Report

A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to her left flank worsening over 2 days. She denied epigastric pain. She had occasional nausea and occasional nonbilious and nonbloody emesis, and also reported diarrhea and weight loss over the preceding months. Laboratory values were largely unremarkable except for a grossly elevated lipase level. Computed tomography scan of her abdomen was performed and revealed findings consistent with infectious colitis, without signs of pancreatic inflammation or other findings associated with pancreatitis. She was admitted to the hospital and treated for infectious colitis with antibiotics and improved over 2 days, and was subsequently discharged for follow-up with her gastroenterologist. This is the first reported case of elevated lipase without pancreatitis associated with infectious colitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of other potential causes of elevated lipase and not assume that all cases of elevated lipase are associated with pancreatitis. This may possibly avoid unnecessary admission in situations that are not clearly pancreatitis.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^117Bi8y8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. There is currently no Cochrane review of the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Objectives

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We excluded case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias. We accepted any of the following reference standards: biopsy, consensus conference definition, radiological features of acute pancreatitis, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, and organ failure. At least two review authors independently searched and screened the references located by the search to identify relevant studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. The thresholds used for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis varied in the trials, resulting in sparse data for each index test. Because of sparse data, we used -2 log likelihood values to determine which model to use for meta-analysis. We calculated and reported the sensitivity, specificity, post-test probability of a positive and negative index test along with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each cutoff, but have reported only the results of the recommended cutoff of three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 50 mg/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 in the abstract.

Main Results

Ten studies including 5056 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in people presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The risk of bias was unclear or high for all of the included studies. The study that contributed approximately two-thirds of the participants included in this review was excluded from the results of the analysis presented below due to major concerns about the participants included in the study. We have presented only the results where at least two studies were included in the analysis. Serum amylase, serum lipase, and urinary trypsinogen-2 at the standard threshold levels of more than three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and a threshold of 50 ng/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 appear to have similar sensitivities (0.72 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82); 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.92); and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84), respectively) and specificities (0.93 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.99); 0.89 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.99); and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93), respectively). At the median prevalence of 22.6% of acute pancreatitis in the studies, out of 100 people with positive test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 74 (95% CI 33 to 94); 68 (95% CI 21 to 94); and 67 (95% CI 57 to 76) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively; out of 100 people with negative test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 8 (95% CI 5 to 12); 7 (95% CI 3 to 15); and 8 (95% CI 5 to 13) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively. We were not able to compare these tests formally because of sparse data.

Authors' Conclusions

As about a quarter of people with acute pancreatitis fail to be diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with the evaluated tests, one should have a low threshold to admit the patient and treat them for acute pancreatitis if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, even if these tests are normal. About 1 in 10 patients without acute pancreatitis may be wrongly diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests, therefore it is important to consider other conditions that require urgent surgical intervention, such as perforated viscus, even if these tests are abnormal. The diagnostic performance of these tests decreases even further with the progression of time, and one should have an even lower threshold to perform additional investigations if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric acute pancreatitis" for pediatric pancreatitis.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present, characterized by acute onset especially in the epigastric region.
- Whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.
- Whether imaging findings are characteristic of or compatible with acute pancreatitis.

For each factor, the response can be either "Yes" or "No". Each "Yes" response contributes 1 point to the total score, while each "No" response contributes 0 points. The points are tallied, resulting in a possible score range from 0 to 3. Here's how it works:

- **Abdominal pain**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Elevated enzyme levels**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Imaging findings**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points

The total score is the sum of the individual scores from these factors. Depending on the total score, the interpretation is as follows:

- A score of 2 or more suggests that the diagnostic criteria are met, indicating a high likelihood of acute pancreatitis.
- A score of 1 or less suggests that the diagnostic criteria are not met, indicating that acute pancreatitis is unlikely.

Through this simple yet effective scoring system, clinicians can systematically assess the presence of symptoms, biochemical markers, and imaging evidence to guide their diagnosis of pediatric acute pancreatitis.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114kiKKi]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on all the above, we recommend urgent endoscopy only in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with evidence of weight loss. Non-urgent endoscopy can be considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting. In those with aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss urgent CT scanning should be considered. In patients from areas at high risk of gastric cancer, or those with a family history of gastro-oesophageal malignancy, the age limit for endoscopy should be reduced to > 40 years. Recommendations as to when to consider endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia and overlapping gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms are as for patients with dyspepsia alone.

In all other patients with dyspepsia a 'test and treat' strategy should be preferred, with those testing negative receiving a course of empirical acid suppression, using the lowest dose that improves their symptoms. Successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' should only be confirmed in those with an increased risk of gastric cancer, as recommended elsewhere in other guidance. As in any other condition, clinical judgement may still suggest the need for endoscopy in individual cases. Similarly, the patient may insist an endoscopy is performed. In the latter instance, it should be reiterated that the yield is likely to be low and the expected diagnosis is FD, with the patient counselled about the risks and benefits of a potentially unnecessary invasive investigation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^111aULg4]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

In terms of other investigations, there is a lack of evidence to support the role of routine laboratory testing to exclude other organic diseases in all patients with dyspepsia. However, a full blood count should be performed in patients aged ≥ 55 years, in line with NICE recommendations concerning possible non-urgent endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia in the presence of a raised platelet count. Screening for coeliac disease is not recommended, as the prevalence is not increased compared with the healthy population. However, this should be performed in patients with overlapping dyspepsia and IBS-type symptoms, as the latter do have an increased risk of coeliac disease. Beyond this, several management strategies for dyspepsia exist, detailed below.

It is estimated that 5% of dyspepsia in the community is attributable to H. pylori. In addition, a positive test for H. pylori will identify most cases of peptic ulcer disease as an underlying cause of dyspepsia, for which eradication therapy is extremely efficacious. Therefore, testing for H. pylori and eradicating the bacterium in patients with dyspepsia in primary care who are found to be infected is logical. This is termed a 'test and treat' strategy and can be done via faecal antigen or carbon-urea breath testing, where available, which have a similar accuracy to rapid urease testing of biopsies obtained at endoscopy. H. pylori serology is not recommended as an alternative, as the specificity is lower than other non-invasive tests. Given that most patients with dyspepsia in primary care will have FD as the cause, repeat testing to confirm successful treatment after an initial course of eradication therapy is not recommended, although a meta-analysis suggested the magnitude of the effect of eradication therapy in FD was larger if H. pylori had been successfully treated.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116VMsmH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The recent ACG/CAG guideline proposes a more pragmatic clinical definition of dyspepsia; predominant epigastric pain lasting at least 1 month, which may be associated with other upper GI symptoms such as epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting, or heartburn, provided that epigastric pain is the patient's primary concern. However, this definition has not been validated in a clinical study, and it places the emphasis on the presence of epigastric pain, despite the extremely common reporting of postprandial symptoms by patients with dyspepsia.

The role of upper GI endoscopy

Any uncertainty over whether a patient's dyspeptic symptoms have an organic or functional cause can, for the most part, be addressed by undertaking upper GI endoscopy, although in the case of suspected biliary or pancreatic disease, an abdominal ultrasound scan might also be necessary. However, a previous systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that more than 70% of people will be labelled as having FD following upper GI endoscopy, with < 10% having peptic ulcer disease, and < 1% having upper GI cancer(Figure 3). These low rates of organic pathology do not justify undertaking an upper GI endoscopy in all patients with dyspepsia, even though symptom-based diagnostic criteria alone are insufficient to exclude organic disease. This is supported by the findings of a primary care-based study, which demonstrated that the cost of detecting each case of upper GI malignancy among patients with dyspepsia was > $80,000. Instead, recent guidelines recommend the targeted use of endoscopic investigation in patients with dyspepsia who also report alarm features, including increasing age, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, or dysphagia (Table 1). However, these also perform poorly for predicting endoscopic findings, with limited predictive value for upper GI malignancy, and therefore using alarm features alone to risk-stratify patients and determine who should be referred for urgent endoscopic investigation is problematic.

The Rome criteria

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would aid the physician greatly in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated, convincingly, that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and FD.

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology, and therefore encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional GI disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning, in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), and the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). EPS consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting; however, it should not fulfil biliary pain criteria. Postprandial epigastric bloating, belching, and nausea can also be present, but are not specific to dyspepsia. PDS is defined as bothersome postprandial fullness after normal-sized meals, or else early satiety that prevents someone finishing a regular-sized meal, with such episodes occurring at least several times per week. Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, belching, or nausea may also be present. But are not specific to dyspepsia. These definitions were determined based on a study of dyspeptic symptom groupings, and also on the fact that up to 80% of patients with dyspepsia report that their symptoms are made worse by eating.

### Human fascioliasis [^116utP5h]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciola hepatica, a zoonotic liver fluke, can also cause disease in humans. Common symptoms are epigastric pain, upper abdominal pain and malaise. Fever and arthralgia are common in acute fascioliasis. Eosinophilia is the predominant laboratory finding, especially in patients with the acute form of the disease. Diagnosis and treatment is not easy, as physicians rarely encounter this disease, and effective drugs are not available in many countries. Human fascioliasis may be underestimated. Patients with eosinophilia and abdominal pain should be evaluated for F. hepatica infestation by parasitological, radiological and serological tests.

### History, physical examination, laboratory testing, and emergency department ultrasonography for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [^1165emXK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common differential for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain. The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for AC have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P), laboratory studies, and ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing AC in the ED.

Methods

We searched medical literature from January 1965 to March 2016 in PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS using a strategy derived from the following formulation of our clinical question: patients-ED patients suspected of AC; interventions-H&P, laboratory studies, and US findings commonly used to diagnose AC; comparator-surgical pathology or definitive diagnostic radiologic study confirming AC; and outcome-the operating characteristics of the investigations in diagnosing AC were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc with a random-effects model (95% CI). Study quality and risks for bias were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.

Results

Separate PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS searches retrieved studies for H&P (n = 734), laboratory findings (n = 74), and US (n = 492). Three H&P studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria with AC prevalence of 7%-64%. Fever had sensitivity ranging from 31% to 62% and specificity from 37% to 74%; positive LR [LR+] was 0.71–1.24, and negative LR [LR-] was 0.76–1.49. Jaundice sensitivity ranged from 11% to 14%, and specificity from 86% to 99%; LR+ was 0.80–13.81, and LR- was 0.87–1.03. Murphy's sign sensitivity was 62% (range = 53%-71%), and specificity was 96% (range = 95%-97%); LR+ was 15.64 (range = 11.48–21.31), and LR- was 0.40 (range = 0.32–0.50). Right upper quadrant pain had sensitivity ranging from 56% to 93% and specificity of 0% to 96%; LR+ ranged from 0.92 to 14.02, and LR- from 0.46 to 7.86. One laboratory study met criteria with a 26% prevalence of AC. Elevated bilirubin had a sensitivity of 40% (range = 12%-74%) and specificity of 93% (range = 77%-99%); LR+ was 5.80 (range = 1.25–26.99), and LR- was 0.64 (range = 0.39–1.08). Five US studies with a prevalence of AC of between 10% and 46%. US sensitivity was 86% (range = 78%-94%) and specificity was 71% (range = 66%-76%); LR+ was 3.23 (range = 1.74–6.00), and LR- was 0.18 (range = 0.10–0.33).

Conclusion

Variable disease prevalence, coupled with limited sample sizes, increases the risk of selection bias. Individually, none of these investigations reliably rule out AC. Development of a clinical decision rule to include evaluation of H&P, laboratory data, and US are more likely to achieve a correct diagnosis of AC.

Doctor–patient communication, diagnosis and investigation of functional dyspepsia

Clinicians should be aware that most patients with dyspepsia will have functional dyspepsia (FD) as the underlying cause of their symptoms after investigation (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that, in the absence of upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs, clinicians should diagnose FD in the presence of bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation and/or postprandial fullness of greater than 8 weeks duration (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
Establishing an effective and empathic doctor–patient relationship and a shared understanding is key to the management of FD. This may reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that the diagnosis of FD, its underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the condition, including common symptom triggers, should be explained to the patient. FD should be introduced as a disorder of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), together with a simple account of the gut–brain axis and how this is impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses to symptoms and postinfective changes (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that a full blood count is performed in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia and coeliac serology in all patients with FD and overlapping irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that if no other upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs are reported, urgent endoscopy is only warranted in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with weight loss, or those aged > 40 years from an area at an increased risk of gastric cancer or with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that non-urgent endoscopy is considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that urgent abdominal CT scanning is considered in patients aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude pancreatic cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that all other patients with dyspepsia are offered non-invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori ('test and treat') and, if infected, given eradication therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).
We recommend that successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' is only confirmed in patients with an increased risk of gastric cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that patients without H. pylori infection are offered empirical acid suppression therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).
Referral of patients with FD to gastroenterology in secondary care is appropriate where there is diagnostic doubt, where symptoms are severe, or refractory to first-line treatments, or where the individual patient requests a specialist opinion (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that gastric emptying testing or 24-hour pH monitoring should not be undertaken routinely in patients with typical symptoms of FD (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that, ideally, patients with FD referred to secondary care are managed in a specialist clinic, with access to an interested clinician, dietetic and lifestyle support, with access to efficacious drugs and gut–brain behavioural therapies. Rates of H. pylori 'test and treat' prior to endoscopy, prevalence of H. pylori infection and use of endoscopy should be audited (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).

Symptom Characterization

Patients were interviewed in the emergency department. The presenting symptoms as reported by the patient were documented on a data collection form (Figure S1) by a research nurse from the trial team blinded to the troponin concentration. If patients reported > 1 symptom (eg, chest pain and dyspnea), both symptoms were recorded as a presenting symptom. Presenting symptoms were then classified as typical or atypical, as described by Greenslade and colleagues. 14 Typical pain was classified in patients reporting the presence of chest, arm, or jaw pain with descriptors of dull, heavy, tight, pressure, ache, squeezing, crushing, or gripping. Atypical pain was classified in patients reporting epigastric or back pain or pain that was burning, stabbing, indigestion‐like, or any other pain description or presentation. 14 Guidelines also state that radiation of pain and the presence of associated symptoms form part of a typical presentation 8; therefore the presence of radiation (right arm, left arm, neck, jaw, back) and presence of any associated feature (nausea, vomiting, sweating, dyspnea, palpitations) was also documented.

### Negative predictive value of intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated upper abdominal pain [^114jhFmi]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to calculate the negative predictive value (NPV) CT of the abdomen in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with undifferentiated upper abdominal pain. Approved by the hospital research ethics board, this retrospective study examined consecutive patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated upper abdominal pain whose intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen was reported as "normal" from June 2006-August 2010. Exclusion criteria included active malignancy, trauma, and known inflammatory bowel disease. True-negative (TN) vs. false-negative (FN) cases were categorized by consensus opinion of radiologist and emergency physician using a composite reference standard including clinical, laboratory, imaging, surgery, pathology, and patient self-reporting via phone questionnaire. The NPV was calculated with confidence intervals of 95%. The TN and FN groups were compared based on gender, age, site of pain, oral contrast use, and laboratory values. One hundred twenty-seven patients were included for analysis. The NPV was 64% (95% CI 55–72). The FN group had a higher proportion of patients with epigastric pain (p = 0.02) and a lower proportion of patients with left upper quadrant pain (p = 0.02). The WBC, lipase, and ALT were all higher in the FN group compared with the TN group. The most commonly missed pathologies were inflammatory conditions of the biliary tract and upper gastrointestinal systems. The NPV of CT for evaluation of undifferentiated upper abdominal pain in the ED was low at 64%. Physicians should consider this limitation and the commonly missed pathology when discharging patients with a "normal" CT report.

Results

There were 286 patients over three months period of the study, 201(70%) females). Median age is 37 years. The causes of abdominal pain are shown in (table 1). Non-specific abdominal pain was the diagnosis in 98 patients (34% of total). 72 (73%) of them were females; the non-specific nature of the pain was made by clinical resolution of the symptoms or diagnostic laparoscopy. None of those patients with nonspecific pain had guarding or vomiting, and only five of them had raised white cells count. Non-surgical cause was seen in 47 patients (table 2).

### Healthcare practitioners' diagnostic and treatment practice patterns of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Poland: a cross-sectional survey [^111RfTnZ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Most physicians participating in this study tested ALT, AST and GGT levels, and approximately 50% evaluated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels. However, significantly more GEs evaluated lipid profiles and glucose levels than GPs. Interestingly, the range of laboratory evaluations conducted by GEs/GPs exceeded basic tests recommended in NAFLD guidelines.

NAFLD diagnosis as the primary disease requires exclusion of certain factors and coexisting conditions which impact hepatic steatosis. In RESTORE, most GEs/GPs excluded patients with significant alcohol consumption and those with chronic hepatitis B or C. However, more GEs vs. GPs also excluded patients with other conditions. GEs/GPs did follow recommendations for excluding patients from a primary NAFLD diagnosis, but GEs were more aware of exclusion conditions, possibly due to their greater experience in liver diseases.

This cross-sectional survey collecting real-world data in Poland provided an ideal opportunity to describe symptoms experienced by patients with NAFLD. This topic is important given that the majority of physicians consider NAFLD to be an asymptomatic disease, and guidelines do not mention symptoms as part of the diagnosis pathway. RESTORE demonstrated that only a few patients with NAFLD had no symptoms; 7% of GEs and 4% of GPs had some patients with no symptoms, and 11% of patients from GE records were asymptomatic. GEs/GPs noted the five most common symptoms/problems as described by patients (bloating, weakening, tiredness/fatigue, epigastric pain, feeling of fullness and stomach pains) and also rated the frequency of symptoms from a list (symptoms occurring very often were: abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, tired/fatigue, lack of energy and abdominal pain). Interestingly, there was a tendency for GEs to consider more general/less specific symptoms (fatigue, loss of energy) in relation to NAFLD diagnosis, compared with GPs. This observation is in keeping with patient-reported outcome studies highlighting fatigue, abdominal discomfort and sleep disturbances as prevalent NAFLD symptoms. Thus, RESTORE highlights NAFLD as a symptom-burdened disease, which is not surprising as NAFLD is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome with disproportionate contribution of metabolic, genetic and environmental factors. The present findings demonstrate that many symptoms, albeit general/nonspecific, should play a greater role, than at present, in NAFLD diagnosis. Awareness needs to be raised by different societies and in guidelines about the wide range of nonspecific NAFLD symptoms, particularly as some symptoms could be suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disease. Recently, a European NAFLD registry has been set up, which includes evaluating symptom burden.

THE EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL AND INITIAL LABORATORIES

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Acute appendicitis management.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would assist in ruling out other diagnoses, such as urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or renal stones. A pregnancy test is mandatory for women of childbearing age.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116v4nbG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### A 21-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis [^111BSaZo]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a disease for which the diagnosis may be difficult to ascertain and the treatments are limited. Using the case of a 21-year-old man who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric pain since age 10 years and was ultimately diagnosed as having idiopathic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis is based on thorough history taking, physical examination, and carefully selected imaging studies. Etiologies may be structural or nonstructural; genes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis have been identified. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by a paucity of randomized controlled trials. We address the patient's concerns regarding chronic pancreatitis, including what he should expect over the next several years, whether endoscopic or surgical therapies should be considered, and whether there are any cures.

Clinical history taking in dyspepsia

Clinical history taking in a patient with dyspepsia should commence with the collection of information concerning the duration and nature of the symptoms. The clinician should elucidate the actual commencement of symptoms, as the patient tends to remember only when symptoms got worse. This is particularly important because a longer symptom duration favours FD over organic disease. The patient should be asked about all possible upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including 'red flags', or alarm symptoms and signs. The clinician should enquire about epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, postprandial fullness, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, belching, regurgitation, dysphagia, including the level at which food sticks, and rumination, ensuring the patient understands what he/she means. There is some evidence that using pictograms can facilitate understanding of these terms by patients. Weight loss is reported frequently by patients with FD. Depending on the patient's age, this may be considered an alarm symptom, so attention should be paid to obtaining objective evidence of this. In the context of dyspepsia, guidelines for the assessment of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that an urgent 2-week wait endoscopy should be offered in patients aged ≥ 55 years old with dyspepsia and weight loss, and non-urgent endoscopy considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years old with treatment-resistant dyspepsia, or aged ≥ 55 years old with dyspepsia with either nausea or vomiting or a raised platelet count. The latter recommendation stems from a significant association between thrombocytosis and gastro-oesophageal cancer in a case–control study of almost 40 000 patients aged over 40 years in UK primary care. All upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms and signs relevant to suspected gastro-oesophageal cancer, as per NICE, are detailed in box 1. However, it is important to point out that these criteria were selected using a threshold of a positive predictive value for gastro-oesophageal cancer of only ≥ 3%.

### Duodeno-pancreatic and extrahepatic biliary tree trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^112gUrST]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of duodeno-pancreatic injuries represents a challenge. In blunt trauma, evidence of direct impact on the upper abdomen such as lower rib fractures, soft tissue ecchymosis, supra-umbilical seat belt sign, and upper lumbar spine fractures following a motor vehicle collision should suggest the involvement of the pancreas and duodenum. Penetrating trauma of the front side or back side of both the lower torso or upper abdomen should be considered highly suspicious for duodeno-pancreatic or extrahepatic biliary tree lesions if the diagnoses have not been ruled out by other diagnostic means.

Clinical signs of traumatic DI are highly non-specific, especially in the early post-traumatic period. Patients usually present with epigastric, right upper quadrant, or back pain 6–24 h after the injury, but the onset of pain has been reported as late as 5 days after injury. The most common test is the analysis of serum amylase and lipase. However, in small-bowel injuries, initial amylase value does not differentiate between patients with perforated and non-perforated DI. A normal amylase level does not exclude DI.

Section 1. Diagnosis of ACC

1.1 As no feature has sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude the diagnosis of ACC, it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical or laboratory finding. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

1.2 For the diagnosis of ACC, we suggest using a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, laboratory tests and imaging investigations. However, the best combination is not known. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

Comment: useful features for the diagnosis of ACC are:
History and clinical examination: fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting or food intolerance; Murphy's sign
Laboratory tests: elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count
Imaging: signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation

The recommendations of the 2016 WSES guidelines were mainly based on two studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis by Trowbridge et al. and a prospective diagnostic study by Eskelinen et al. This evidence, although flawed by the limitations described below, remains relevant and the associated statement remains valid.

The paper by Trowbridge et al. included 17 studies, which reported a quantitative assessment of history, physical examination and/or laboratory tests for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The results showed that, with the exception of Murphy's sign (positive likelihood ratio — LR 2.8; 95% CI 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR0.4; 95% CI 0.2–1.1) — although the 95% confidence intervals included 1.0 in both cases, none of the clinical signs or laboratory tests showed LRs higher than 1.6 or negative LRs lower than 0.4. Limitations were identified in a possible selection bias, as patients with abdominal pain and patients with a suspected diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were included in the study, and in a heterogeneous definition of the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^1166nDNF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — initial evaluation should include focused history, examination, laboratories, and diagnostic imaging with preferred modalities to exclude mechanical obstruction. Recommendation 11 states: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination, baseline laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Typical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, altered bowel function, and dilation of the ascending and transverse colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction on imaging, and routine laboratory testing, such as a basic metabolic panel, should be included during the initial evaluation. For diagnosis, computed tomography or water-soluble contrast enema can reliably distinguish ACPO from a mechanical large-bowel obstruction, and unless there is a high suspicion for a distal obstruction, endoscopy is not typically recommended for diagnostic purposes given the associated risk of perforation in the setting of colon dilation.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

GRACE-2 scope — recurrent abdominal pain populations and prior workup applicability: The guideline is not intended to apply to patients who have not yet undergone evaluation of potential causes, and instead addresses patients who, despite prior medical evaluation for the cause of pain, have not had a cause identified, noting that ongoing or repeated medical evaluations may have risks and benefits that should be balanced such as cost, radiation exposure, and identification of incidental findings prompting further workup with uncertain benefit. The writing group also considered but ultimately did not include patients for whom the cause of recurrent abdominal pain has been identified or is very likely (e.g., pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, nephrolithiasis), even though these populations may suffer consequences of repeated radiation exposure from imaging and other negative effects of recurrent ED presentations.

### An evaluation of the utility of routine laboratory monitoring of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): a retrospective review [^115pvdZ6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Previous studies which have reported a wider range of adverse events potentially related to NSAID use, including some that are significantly higher, are limited by small sample sizes and potential selection bias. In a United Kingdom study of 13 children on NSAIDs with Juvenile Chronic Arthritis (JCA) complaining of abdominal pain or nausea, endoscopic findings were mild. Only one patient had a single duodenal erosion at first endoscopy to account for an unexplained drop in Hgb associated with mild nausea. They determined that significant ulceration commonly seen in adults was not observed and there was no correlation between the small number of petechial lesions and mild gastritis with reported symptoms. Mulberg et al. reported endoscopically-documented gastric injury in 13 of 17 patients (76%) with JRA referred for epigastric abdominal pain, hematemesis, guiac positive stools and/or iron deficiency anemia. These patients were evaluated prospectively, however only symptomatic patients were eligible. The evaluation included a complete blood cell count and evaluation of the stool for occult blood in all patients, followed by endoscopy. There was a strong correlation between gastric lesions and the presence of epigastric pain, regardless of the presence of anemia or occult blood in stool. Similarly, a retrospective study by Dowd et al. of children with arthritis receiving NSAIDs reported that 16 of 47 patients (34%) with symptoms of significant abdominal pain were found to have gastric or duodenal radiographic injury. As with Mulberg's study, however, only patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated. Our study did not attempt to identify whether or not laboratory testing was performed as a result of patients having symptoms that might have been related to NSAID use. We instead chose to review all laboratory testing performed during this period, and identify all detected abnormalities. Although we have concluded that routine laboratory screening may have limited utility, laboratory testing of select symptomatic children may be of greater clinical value.

Diagnostic protocol and observer experience

Eligible patients gave written informed consent before inclusion. Figure 1shows a flow chart of the study protocol. Included patients had a medical history, physical examination, and initial laboratory investigations. A diagnosis based on clinical evaluation and laboratory investigation was recorded. Thereafter, patients were investigated with a full structured imaging protocol, including upright chest and supine abdominal plain radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT. After the physician in the emergency department had assessed the plain radiographs, a new diagnosis was recorded. Ultrasonography and CT were each read without disclosure of any results of the other investigation, but clinical information was available to the readers of ultrasonography and CT. The reader recorded the radiological diagnosis from the same list of diagnoses that was used by the physicians in the emergency department.

Fig 1 Flow chart of study protocol. *Completed for all 1021 patients

A general survey of the abdomen was done with ultrasonography, using the graded compression technique.CT images were obtained from the diaphragm to the groins. CT protocols were based on the following protocol: effective mAs level of 165, 120 kV, maximum 2.5 mm collimation, maximum 3 mm slice width, and 0.5 s rotation time, and with injection of 125 mL intravenous contrast after a 60 second delay with 3 ml/s; no oral or rectal contrast agents were used. CT done after office hours was re-evaluated blinded the next day by a radiologist.

Final diagnosis

We followed all included patients for at least six months. We systematically collected data on clinical, laboratory, and surgical findings; pathology results; imaging reports; and outcomes of treatment. We contacted general practitioners to verify patients' outcomes. An expert panel formed of two gastrointestinal surgeons and an abdominal radiologist with long term clinical experience assigned a final diagnosis (panel members are listed in the web appendix). The panel members had not been involved in the investigation or management of the evaluated cases. Each panel member individually evaluated every case; data were presented in a standardised format, including all available information collected during follow-up. Disagreements on the final diagnosis were resolved during consensus meetings. All final diagnoses were classified as urgent or non-urgent. We defined urgent diagnoses as conditions needing treatment within 24 hours.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^114YdWpw]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — diagnostic criteria and etiologies specify that diagnosis of AP requires at least 2 features, including characteristic abdominal pain; biochemical evidence with amylase or lipase elevated > 3 times the upper limit of normal; and/or radiographic evidence on cross-sectional imaging. The most common causes remain gallstones and alcohol, which together comprise 80% of cases, and most cases of AP (around 80%) are mild with only interstitial changes without local or systemic complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis and is typically seen in patients with moderately severe or severe AP.

### A clinical model for the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in the emergency department [^116CZ1yE]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to develop a diagnostic model that predicts acute pancreatitis (AP) risk before imaging.

Methods

Emergency department patients with serum lipase elevated to 3 times the upper limit of normal or greater were identified retrospectively (September 1, 2013-August 31, 2015). An AP diagnosis was established by expert review of full hospitalization records. Candidate predictors included demographic and clinical characteristics at presentation. Using a derivation set, a multivariable logistic regression model and corresponding point-based scoring system was developed to predict AP. Discrimination accuracy and calibration were assessed in a separate validation set.

Results

In 319 eligible patients, 182 (57%) had AP. The final model (area under curve, 0.92) included 8 predictors: number of prior AP episodes; history of cholelithiasis; no abdominal surgery (prior 2 months); time elapsed from symptom onset; pain localized to epigastrium, of progressively worsening severity, and severity level at presentation; and extent of lipase elevation. At a diagnostic risk threshold of 8 points or higher (≥ 99%), the model identified AP with a sensitivity of 45%, and a specificity and a positive predictive value of 100%.

Conclusions

In emergency department patients with lipase elevated to 3 times the upper limit of normal or greater, this model helps identify AP risk before imaging. Prospective validation studies are needed to confirm diagnostic accuracy.
