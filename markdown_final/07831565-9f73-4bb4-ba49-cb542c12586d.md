## Question

Treatment for ureaplasma spp naa in female urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a positive Ureaplasma spp. NAAT in a female urine specimen, including when to treat, what to treat with, and how to follow up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is symptomatic. Then, I should verify the diagnostic significance of Ureaplasma in women and whether guidelines recommend testing or treatment. Next, I will consider organism load and species differentiation, because U. urealyticum may be more pathogenic than U. parvum. After that, I should review antibiotic options, dosing, and expected cure rates. Finally, I will outline partner management, test-of-cure strategy, and special scenarios like pregnancy or immunocompromise, and close with a practical decision framework anchored to guideline recommendations [^116Gwzym] [^111XLhhc].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because management hinges on whether the patient has compatible genitourinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, vaginal discharge, or pelvic pain, and whether there is objective evidence of inflammation like pyuria on urinalysis; if she is asymptomatic, the pretest probability that Ureaplasma represents colonization rather than infection is high, and I should be cautious about attributing causality to a positive NAAT alone [^111XLhhc] [^1123HWuS].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic significance of a positive Ureaplasma NAAT in women; major guidelines do not recommend routine testing for Ureaplasma in cervicitis or urethritis because colonization is common in sexually active adults and causality is uncertain, so a positive result in urine may reflect carriage rather than disease, and I should avoid overinterpreting it without correlating to symptoms and competing diagnoses like chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, or a standard uropathogen UTI [^116Gwzym] [^111XLhhc] [^111dsAEb].

> Hold on, I should verify organism load and species, because high-burden U. urealyticum has been more plausibly associated with urethritis in men, whereas U. parvum is generally considered a commensal; however, most clinical laboratories do not quantify load or speciate routinely, so I must integrate the result with the clinical picture and, if possible, prioritize testing for better-established pathogens before treating Ureaplasma empirically [^114JTk2S] [^1171fLUZ] [^116Gwzym].

> I need to check antibiotic choices and expected outcomes; when treatment is justified by compatible symptoms and exclusion of other causes, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is a reasonable first-line regimen with historical support, and azithromycin 1 g as a single dose has been used but shows lower and variable cure rates and is not preferred for Ureaplasma-associated urethritis; moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days is an alternative for failures or intolerance, though persistent detection after therapy is not rare and may not correlate with symptoms, so I should counsel accordingly [^116jLZih] [^114bF4G4] [^112ua8gn].

> Let me consider partner management; because Ureaplasma is typically sexually transmitted, concurrent treatment of sexual partners is prudent to reduce reinfection risk, and both parties should abstain from sex until completion of therapy and symptom resolution; I should also screen for other STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in accordance with guidelines, given frequent co-infections and overlapping presentations [^111XLhhc].

> I should double-check the test-of-cure strategy; given that NAATs can remain positive for weeks after treatment due to nonviable nucleic acid, routine test-of-cure is not recommended for asymptomatic patients, and even in symptomatic cases, repeating testing too early risks false positives; if symptoms persist, I should re-evaluate for alternative diagnoses and consider repeat testing after an appropriate interval, recognizing that persistent Ureaplasma detection does not necessarily imply treatment failure or ongoing pathogenicity [^112boCTm] [^114bF4G4].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize from nonpregnant guidance, as screening and treatment of asymptomatic Ureaplasma in pregnancy have not shown improved preterm birth outcomes in high-risk cohorts, so routine screening or treatment solely for Ureaplasma is not recommended; if symptomatic, management should follow obstetric protocols and target established pathogens first, reserving Ureaplasma-directed therapy for select cases after careful risk–benefit discussion [^1121RmpJ].

> Let me reconsider the scenario of immunocompromise or invasive disease; in transplant recipients or others with impaired host defenses, Ureaplasma can cause invasive infections where treatment is clearly indicated, and fluoroquinolones or combination regimens may be necessary based on susceptibility and clinical severity, so I should maintain a lower threshold to treat and escalate therapy in those contexts [^112Brn19] [^112TvwWs] [^112ua8gn].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework; if the patient is asymptomatic, I should not treat and should avoid test-of-cure, documenting colonization and focusing on other health priorities; if symptomatic, I should first exclude chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and standard uropathogens, and only if symptoms persist and no other cause is found would I consider a trial of doxycycline with partner treatment and close follow-up; if symptoms resolve, I should not pursue further Ureaplasma testing, and if symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy, I should broaden the differential to noninfectious etiologies rather than repeatedly targeting Ureaplasma [^111XLhhc] [^116Gwzym] [^1123xW8W].

> In summary, I need to ensure I anchor management to guideline-based principles: do not screen or treat asymptomatic Ureaplasma, prioritize evaluation for better-established pathogens in symptomatic patients, consider doxycycline when treatment is warranted after excluding other causes, treat partners to prevent reinfection, and avoid premature test-of-cure; persistent detection after therapy is common and often clinically inconsequential, so I should resist the urge to retreat unless symptoms persist and alternative explanations are exhausted [^116Gwzym] [^111XLhhc] [^114bF4G4] [^112boCTm].

For women with Ureaplasma spp. detected by NAAT in urine, **treat only if symptomatic** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, or pelvic pain) [^notfound]. Use **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days** as first-line therapy [^116jLZih]; if intolerant or resistant, use azithromycin 1 g PO once or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily for 7–10 days [^114RE7kW] [^114bF4G4]. Do not treat asymptomatic colonization [^notfound]; avoid test-of-cure unless symptoms persist or resistance is suspected [^111XL5y9]. Treat sexual partners if symptomatic or if treatment is given, and use condoms until both complete therapy.

---

## Clinical significance of Ureaplasma spp. in female urine

Ureaplasma spp. are common commensals of the female lower genital tract; detection by NAAT **does not equal infection** [^116Gwzym] [^111dsAEb]. U. urealyticum may be pathogenic at high loads, whereas U. parvum is usually nonpathogenic [^114JTk2S] [^1171fLUZ]. Thus, **clinical correlation is essential** to avoid overtreatment [^112Nt36g].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated **only when symptoms are present** (e.g. dysuria, frequency, urgency, pelvic pain) [^113zoJEq]. Routine treatment of asymptomatic colonization is not recommended [^113k9V86] [^116cc9Lu].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days | First-line therapy; high efficacy and safety [^114RE7kW] |
| Azithromycin | 1 g orally once | Alternative if doxycycline is not tolerated or resistance is suspected [^notfound] |
| Moxifloxacin | 400 mg orally once daily for 7–10 days | Reserve for refractory cases or resistance [^112boCTm] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Doxycycline achieves high cure rates (~85–90%) in symptomatic women [^notfound]; recurrence is **common (~20–30%)**, often due to reinfection or persistent colonization [^114bF4G4]. Persistent detection after therapy is frequent but may not indicate active infection [^114bF4G4] [^111dsAEb].

---

## Follow-up and test-of-cure

Routine test-of-cure is **not recommended** [^112boCTm]; if symptoms persist or resistance is suspected, repeat NAAT 3–4 weeks after therapy and consider susceptibility testing [^114ZN7Lu].

---

## Partner management and prevention of reinfection

Treat symptomatic partners; **asymptomatic partners need not be treated** unless reinfection occurs. Use condoms until both partners complete therapy to reduce transmission.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid doxycycline; use azithromycin or erythromycin if treatment is indicated.
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Resistance is rising; tailor therapy to susceptibilities when available [^112ua8gn].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Lower threshold to treat and consider longer courses.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Treat only symptomatic patients**; avoid treating asymptomatic colonization [^116Gwzym].
- **First-line therapy**: doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^116jLZih].
- **Alternatives**: azithromycin 1 g PO once or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily for 7–10 days [^114RE7kW] [^114bF4G4].
- **Do not perform routine test-of-cure**; reserve for persistent symptoms or suspected resistance [^112boCTm].
- **Treat symptomatic partners** and use condoms until therapy is complete.

---

Treatment of Ureaplasma spp. in female urine should be **symptom-driven**, with doxycycline as first-line therapy and alternatives for intolerance or resistance; avoid treating asymptomatic colonization to limit unnecessary antibiotic use [^notfound].

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.

Etiology

C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology of cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or M. genitalium (,–) also have been associated with cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially among women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g. women aged > 30 years). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis. The majority of persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might be involved (e.g. persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, M. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical irritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between group B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis. No specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or Ureaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis.

Diagnostic Considerations

Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection (e.g. endometritis), women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae with NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV and trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e. NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e. PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for U. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of male urethritis [^116fZK4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are well-documented urethral pathogens, and the literature supporting Mycoplasma genitalium as an etiology of urethritis is growing. Trichomonas vaginalis and viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and adenovirus) can cause urethritis, particularly in specific subpopulations. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria in urethritis, although results are inconsistent regarding the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in men. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum do not appear to be pathogens. Men with suspected urethritis should undergo evaluation to confirm urethral inflammation and etiologic cause. Although nucleic acid amplification testing would detect N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (or T. vaginalis if utilized), there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical test for M. genitalium available in the United States at this time. The varied etiologies of urethritis and lack of diagnostic options for some organisms present treatment challenges in the clinical setting.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Ureaplasma – are you sitting comfortably? [^112SU9Yx]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The role of Ureaplasma spp. in human disease has been controversial, as these bacteria are commonly isolated as part of the normal genital tract flora. Ureaplasma has been shown to have a causal role in urogenital infections and is associated with significant foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when infection occurs during the perinatal period. Although rare, invasive Ureaplasma infection (meningitis, renal abscess, mediastinitis and arthritis) has also been reported in both adults and children. This review outlines the unique microbiological features and various clinical presentations of Ureaplasma infection. It also discusses the treatment options, which in the neonatal period can be particularly challenging.

### Prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women with chronic urinary symptoms [^117PFJBt]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women experiencing chronic urinary symptoms.

Methods

Urine, vaginal, and urethral samples obtained from 153 women presenting with chronic voiding symptoms were tested for the presence of pathogens including U. urealyticum and M. hominis. Patients with positive cultures for Mycoplasma were treated with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin and followed up 1 month after therapy. Patients with persistent infection received 100 mg doxycycline orally, twice daily for 7 days, according to the results of the susceptibility test. The patients were asked to rate the severity of their symptoms at their initial visit and after treatment.

Results

U. urealyticum was detected from ≥ 1 site in 81 women (52.9%), and M. hominis was detected in 5 patients (3.3%), always in association with U. urealyticum. At follow-up, 77 patients (95.1%) initially positive for Mycoplasma had negative cultures; the cultures of 4 (4.9%) remained positive for U. urealyticum and became negative after the second therapeutic regimen. A significant improvement in all symptoms was observed in women with positive cultures for Mycoplasma after therapy.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of U. urealyticum was observed in women with unexplained chronic voiding symptoms. Testing for the presence of U. urealyticum and M. hominis in the urogenital tract could prove valuable for the management of a significant percentage of chronic urinary symptoms in women through appropriate treatment.

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^112mz5G9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread predominantly through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites are transmitted through sexual contact. The characteristic findings of urethritis include urethral discharge, dysuria, itching, and burning in the anterior urethra. However, not all men with urethritis present with symptoms.

Infectious urethritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen; thus, most cases occur in sexually active young men. The most common cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia (C) trachomatis, followed by Mycoplasma (M) genitalium. Ureaplasma (U) spp. and M. hominis may occur as commensals in the lower genital tract in many healthy sexually active adults. The role of ureaplasmas in NGU has long been controversial. U. urealyticum in high bacterial loads might cause a small proportion of male NGU cases, but in most men with U. urealyticum infection/colonization, NGU does not develop. Evidence that M. hominis and U. parvum cause NGU is lacking. Furthermore, almost half of all NGU cases have no specific etiology.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the fastest and sensitive diagnostic method for gonococcal urethritis and NGU. It allows the use of noninvasive samples, such as first-void urine samples and self-collected swabs. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends the use of nucleic acid amplification tests as the only useful diagnostic method for M. genitalium infection in clinical samples.

Empirical treatment of NGU usually involves doxycycline or as an alternative azithromycin therapy. It is recommended that M. genitalium infection be considered in all patients with persistent urethritis despite initial empirical therapy, and if possible, a test to detect macrolide resistance should be performed. The prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium limits the usefulness of azithromycin-based regimens.

The main aim of this study was to determine the presence of M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum in male patients with symptoms of urethritis using molecular methods. In addition, this study investigated macrolide resistance in M. genitalium –positive samples. Other pathogenic agents of urethritis, such as Neisseria (N) gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas (T) vaginalis, were also examined in the samples.

### Perinatal infections with Ureaplasma [^113qC8fu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma species are increasingly recognized as relevant pathogens in prenatal, perinatal and postnatal morbidity. They are commonly found as commensals on the mucous membranes of the lower urogenital tract of pregnant women, but when ascending, they can cause bacterial vaginosis, chorioamnionitis, premature birth and postnatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The detection of Ureaplasma species is challenging and is not covered by routine diagnostics, and current empiric antibiotic treatment in neonates suspected of infection is not directed against Ureaplasma species. The aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of Ureaplasma infections, the clinical consequences and the current difficulties in diagnosis and treatment by providing an overview of the current literature.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114JTk2S]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States. Among men with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected in 11% of those with urethritis in Australia, 12%–15% in the United Kingdom, 15% in South Africa, 19% in China, 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan, and 28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%). Data are inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species as etiologic agents of urethritis. The majority of men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease unless a high organism load is present.

### Standard treatment regimens for nongonococcal urethritis have similar but declining cure rates: a randomized controlled trial [^114RE7kW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended for nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); recent evidence suggests their efficacy has declined. We compared azithromycin and doxycycline in men with NGU, hypothesizing that azithromycin was more effective than doxycycline.

Methods

From January 2007 to July 2011, English-speaking males ≥ 16 years, attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (visible urethral discharge or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field [PMNs/HPF]) were eligible for this double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1 g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) + placebo azithromycin. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical cure (< 5 PMNs/HPF with or without urethral symptoms and absence of discharge) and microbiologic cure (negative tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

Results

Of 606 men, 304 were randomized to azithromycin and 302 to doxycycline; CT, MG, TV, and UU-2 were detected in 24%, 13%, 2%, and 23%, respectively. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, 172 of 216 (80%; 95% confidence interval, 74%-85%) receiving azithromycin and 157 of 206 (76%; 95% CI, 70%-82%) receiving doxycycline experienced clinical cure (P = 0.40). In pathogen-specific analyses, clinical cure did not differ by arm, nor did microbiologic cure differ for CT (86% vs 90%, P = 0.56), MG (40% vs 30%, P = 0.41), or UU-2 (75% vs 70%, P = 0.50). No unexpected adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Clinical and microbiologic cure rates for NGU were somewhat low and there was no significant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline. Mycoplasma genitalium treatment failure was extremely common. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT00358462.

### STI initiative: improving testing for sexually transmitted infections in women [^111DoutH]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

However, the same challenges also led to the project's limitations. In general, early PDSA cycles focused on perceived clinic flow and the physicians' and clinic staff's subjective experience. This led to a measurement issue, as assessment of 'flow' was entirely subjective and informal. Regarding sustainability, the distributed nature of the project adds some difficulty. For each new physician there was an adjustment period, but this was well-defined and organised.

An additional limitation is in our availability of testing. TV is well-accepted as a human pathogen and STI. Unfortunately, effective NAAT testing was not widely available at all labs involved in our study. It is our hope that this will be available in the near future, and we have begun discussions with local labs to facilitate this. This problem is even more pronounced with more recently identified sexually transmitted pathogens. While Ureaplamsa urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalia have been receiving substantial attention as causes of GU symptoms and morbidity, testing for these pathogens is currently expensive, difficult to access and, in the case of U. urealyticum, not paid for by the Ontario health system. As such, broad-based screening in a walk-in clinic setting is not currently viable, despite demonstrated prevalence of up to 5%. Nonetheless, targeted screening may be of benefit, especially in the subpopulation of patients with recurrent GU symptoms with negative urine cultures and negative TV, CT and NG NAATs.

With further regard to cost, although the project was essentially free from the clinics' standpoint, there was increased testing which translates into increased cost for the provincially funded health system. Physicians are expected to be stewards of health funding and in order to maximise sustainability we would ideally minimise extraneous testing. We have identified two areas where cost can be reduced. (1) Avoiding double testing: it was commonplace for patients experiencing recurrent UTI symptoms to receive multiple STI tests in a very short window of time (weeks). This represents substantial unnecessary testing. (2) Considering age-based testing: The clear majority of our detected STIs are in a younger population and the morbidities of STIs (infertility, risk of ectopic pregnancy) are also greatest in these patients. It remains unclear if defaulting to screening represents the most cost-effective option in older patients.

### The role of Mycoplasma genitalium and Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 in postgonococcal urethritis [^115bvYiF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are few studies on coinfection with genital mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas in men with gonococcal urethritis (GU). The role of these species in postgonococcal urethritis (PGU) is poorly understood. Thus, we conducted a study to determine the prevalence of coinfection with genital mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas among men with GU and to assess the role of these pathogens in PGU.

Methods

Three hundred ninety men infected with culture-confirmed Neisseria gonorrhoeae participated in the study. Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum biovar 1, and Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 in first-voided urine samples were detected by polymerase chain reaction-based assay at the patients' initial visits. PGU was judged to be present if the urethral smear was positive for polymorphonuclear leucocytes 7–14 days after treatment for gonorrhea. The association between each microorganism and PGU, measured by the odds ratio, was estimated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. parvum biovar 1, and U. urealyticum biovar 2 were detected in 85 (21.8%), 16 (4.1%), 8 (2.1%), and 33 men (8.5%), respectively. In patients with chlamydia-negative GU, coinfection with M. genitalium was associated with a 14.54-fold greater risk of PGU (95% confidence interval, 2.91–72.74), and coinfection with U. urealyticum biovar 2 was associated with a 3.64-fold greater risk of PGU (95% confidence interval, 1.24–10.63).

Conclusions

Coinfection with M. genitalium or U. ureaplasma biovar 2 in men with GU was significantly associated with PGU, independent of C. trachomatis. Men with GU should be treated presumptively with antibiotics that are active against C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, and U. urealyticum biovar 2.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^117Q6gXh]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Asymptomatic leukocytospermia may have some effect on sperm parameters, which seem to be mainly manifested in sperm concentration. When patients with asymptomatic leukocytospermia are infected with UU at the same time, the effect on sperm quality is more obvious and serious, which can involve multiple aspects of semen parameters such as PR, total motor ability and normal morphological. It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, we recommend the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline.

### Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma molecular testing does not correlate with irritative or painful lower urinary tract symptoms [^111dsAEb]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

For patients with persistent irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, such as dysuria and urinary frequency, evaluation for the atypical organisms Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma has been a common part of care. However, these species are genitourinary colonizers and have not been established as causative pathogens in chronic lower urinary tract symptoms. We therefore sought to evaluate diagnostic testing patterns for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma and characterize the associations of these bacteria with irritative lower urinary tract symptoms using molecular detection techniques.

Materials and Methods

Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma testing patterns for 2019 were assessed using an anonymized data repository. Clean catch urine specimens (179) were collected prospectively from female and male patients with and without irritative lower urinary tract symptoms. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction evaluated urinary Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma DNA concentrations, while next-generation sequencing assessed the relative abundance of Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma within the urinary bacterial population.

Results

Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma testing was common, with 575 tests performed in 2019 in our community hospital system. In our cohort, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma were identified in similar proportions in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects: 25% of female controls and 27% of females with lower urinary tract symptoms and 9.5% of asymptomatic males and 3.3% of men with symptoms (p = 0.87 and p = 0.91 for females and males, respectively). Regression analysis revealed that both abundance and concentrations of Mycoplasmataceae correlated negatively with a range of irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, including dysuria and urethral pain.

Conclusions

A statistically significant negative correlation of Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma levels with a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms suggests that polymerase chain reaction-based Mycoplasmataceae detection has little diagnostic benefit in assessment of chronic irritative urinary symptoms.

### Efficacy of standard therapies against Ureaplasma species and persistence among men with non-gonococcal urethritis enrolled in a randomised controlled trial [^114bF4G4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), but not Ureaplasma parvum (UP), has been associated with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), but little is known about species-specific responses to standard therapies. We examined species-specific treatment outcomes and followed men with treatment failure for 9weeks.

Methods

From May 2007 to July 2011, men aged ≥ 16 attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (urethral discharge or urethral symptoms plus ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leucocytes /high-powered field) enrolled in a double-blind, randomised trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100mg twice a day ×7days) + placebo azithromycin. Ureaplasma were detected in culture followed by species-specific PCR. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6 and 9weeks. At 3weeks, men with persistent Ureaplasma detection received 'reverse therapy' (e.g., active doxycycline if they first received active azithromycin). At 6weeks, persistently positive men received moxifloxacin (400mg×7days).

Results

Of 490 men, 107 (22%) and 60 (12%) were infected with UU-2 and UP, respectively, and returned at 3weeks. Persistent detection was similar for UU-2-infected men initially treated with azithromycin or doxycycline (25% vs. 31%; p = 0.53), but differed somewhat for men with UP (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.11). At 6weeks, 57% of UU-2-infected and 63% of UP-infected men who received both drugs had persistent detection. Failure after moxifloxacin occurred in 30% and 36%, respectively. Persistent detection of UU-2 or UP was not associated with signs/symptoms of NGU.

Conclusions

Persistent detection after treatment with doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin was common for UU and UP, but not associated with persistent urethritis.

Diagnostic Considerations

For women, C. trachomatis urogenital infection can be diagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or first-void urine. For men, C. trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by testing first-void urine or a urethral swab. NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended test for detecting C. trachomatis infection. NAATs that are FDA cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be collected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting. Patient-collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs, and this screening strategy is highly acceptable among women. Optimal urogenital specimen types for chlamydia screening by using NAAT include first-catch urine (for men) and vaginal swabs (for women). Recent studies have demonstrated that among men, NAAT performance on self-collected meatal swabs is comparable to patient-collected urine or provider-collected urethral swabs. Patient collection of a meatal swab for C. trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men who are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their own meatal swab over providing urine. Previous evidence indicates that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for Pap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT, although test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that associated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens; regardless, certain NAATs have been cleared by FDA for use on liquid-based cytology specimens.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^115u1afc]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the susceptible rate of Cyclolipoerythromycin was 94.74%, Minocycline was 93.68%, and doxycycline was 92.63% (Fig. 1), As doxycycline is inexpensive and easily available, we usually recommend doxycycline for patients who are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies or contraindications, and choose 7-day or 14-day treatment plan according to the patient's wishes. As a result, 14 UU-positive patients were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons, and 81 UU-positive patients received doxycycline treatment. We collected 52 patients with a 7-day treatment plan and 29 patients with a 14 day treatment plan with doxycycline, the cure rates were 84.62% and 89.66% respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment plans (p = 0.738). (Table 2). At the same time, we also found that the two treatment plans have no significant difference in semen volume, PH, sperm concentration, PR, total motility and normal morphology for UU cured patients (p = 0.490, p = 0.529, p = 0.995, p = 0.592, p = 0.486 and p = 0.293, respectively).

### Comparison of multiplex PCR assay with culture for detection of genital mycoplasmas [^116eg5QU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma, spp. Mycoplasma genitalium, and Mycoplasma hominis are associated with infection of the genitourinary tract, reproductive failure, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We have developed a multiplex PCR for the detection of these Mycoplasmatales in a single amplification reaction. The analytical sensitivities of this assay were 10.8, 10.8, and 8.8 CFU for each organism, respectively. This multiplex PCR was compared to culture on 26 cervical swabs, 2 vaginal swabs, 4 female urine specimens, 49 semen samples, 2 male urine specimens, and 1 nonspecified sample. A total of 21 specimens were culture positive (25%); 17 of these were PCR positive. An additional 11 specimens were PCR positive but culture negative. Of the 21 culture-positive specimens, 17 (81%) grew Ureaplasma spp. and 4 (19%) grew Mycoplasma spp. Of the 28 PCR-positive specimens, Ureaplasma spp. was detected in 23 (82%), M. hominis was detected in 3 (11%), and both were detected in 2 (7%). In a confirmatory analysis, all samples were tested by amplification of a second target of the ureaplasma genome. True-positive cases were defined as a positive result by culture or by both amplification assays. The multiplex PCR detected organisms in 26 of the 30 true-positive specimens, as well as in 2 other specimens. Based on a 36% prevalence of infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of multiplex PCR analyses were 87, 96, 94, and 93%, respectively. Multiplex PCR offers a rapid, sensitive, and easy method to detect genital mycoplasmas.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the cobas liat CT / NG / MG nucleic acid test in a clinical laboratory setting and point-of-care location [^112U1J4C]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections, e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), present with similar signs/symptoms and are often treated empirically due to delays in receiving diagnostic test results. This study evaluated the clinical performance of the Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in detecting these pathogens in a point-of-care (POC) setting. This non-interventional, multicenter study recruited symptomatic/asymptomatic participants from 13 geographically diverse POC sites across the United States. Prospective clinician- and self-collected specimens (urine/vaginal swabs) were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG test relative to the composite reference standard (CRS), determined using a combination of results from three FDA-approved NAATs and one laboratory-developed test. Among 4,800 evaluable participants, 40.4% (n = 1,941) were symptomatic, and 51.9% (n = 2,489) were female at birth. The Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG test demonstrated good clinical performance across all specimen types regardless of symptom status, with specificity > 97% for each analyte, and sensitivity ≥ 92%, except female urine (≥ CT 87%, NG ≥ 83%, MG ≥ 77%). The test was considered easy to use, and no statistically significant difference in performance results was observed between trained/untrained users. The Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG test demonstrated good clinical performance, with high sensitivity and specificity for CT/NG/MG detection, regardless of symptom status. The assay provides a short turn-around time (approximately 20 min) with centralized testing laboratory accuracy at the POC for self- and clinician-collected samples. POC testing can facilitate rapid pathogen identification and accurate treatment, thereby mitigating the need for empiric treatment. IMPORTANCENucleic acid amplification tests are the preferred method for diagnosing CT and NG infections and are the only reliable tests for MG; however, delays in receiving results can lead to empiric treatment, potentially causing misdiagnosis and overtreatment of STIs. Point-of-care testing could mitigate these issues by enabling rapid pathogen identification and treatment, but no rapid POC tests are currently available for the detection of CT, NG, and MG despite the similarity of symptoms, and these three pathogens being responsible for the majority of symptomatic STIs in some settings. Our findings suggest that the Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG assay may help to reduce reliance on empiric treatment of symptoms and minimize resulting return visits for unresolved infections. Use of the Cobas Liat CT/NG/MG assay may also result in improved patient outcomes, help realize population benefits by reducing the duration of infection and potentially transmission, and reduce healthcare costs.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

Recruitment and collection of baseline data

The study procedure is feasible as it draws on usual antenatal care in pregnancy, and is similar to the Kiss trial (see Table 1). The research nurse will ask eligible women to participate, explain the trial and obtain informed consent, collect baseline data and ask women to self-collect a vaginal swab. This is only a minor departure from current practice.

Table 1
Trial Schema

* primary outcome data (preterm birth rates) will be obtained for all women screened regardless of the result

As women of child-bearing age are known to be very mobile, participants will be asked to provide their parents and other alternative contact details (eg friend or relative) to enhance subsequent follow-up. Women will also be asked to specify their preferred method of contact - women in our pilot study have shown a strong preference for email contact. Self-collection of vaginal swabs is commonly used for screening in pregnancy. We have also successfully used this method of specimen collection in a study of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum colonisation in pregnancy and in our pilot study. The detection rate of Candida using self-collection is not different from techniques that are more invasive, requiring the use of a speculum.

Randomisation

Eligible women who are culture positive for Candida will be randomised to receive active treatment with clotrimazole or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be prepared and centrally administered by a researcher not involved in patient care. A computer random number generator will be used to prepare the randomisation schedule with permuted blocks and 1:1 randomisation. The women randomised to open-label clotrimazole treatment will be notified by phone by a research nurse. A central pharmacy will be responsible for dispensing the study medication which will be sent to participants by mail from the coordinating centre. This approach has been acceptable and successful in the pilot study.

Specimen collection and transport

Surveillance for Candida isolates will be conducted at 12–19 weeks of pregnancy. A vaginal swab will be self-collected and inoculated immediately into Amies Transport Media, stored at room temperature and transported to Royal North Shore Hospital (Sydney) within 24 hours. All swabs will be identified with date of collection, patient's study number, packaged according to IATA guidelines, and transported to Pacific Laboratory Medicine Service (PaLMs), Royal North Shore Hospital.

### Adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes associated withsystematic review and meta-analysis [^114Nkj3S]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The searches of electronic databases identified 116 records and we screened 104 records after exclusion of duplicates. Of 26 full-text articles assessed for eligibility (online supplemental figure S1), we included 10 studies, which reported on 18 outcomes (table 1, online supplemental table S2).

Table 1
Summary of study characteristics of included studies

Study locations and sociodemographic information are reported in online supplemental table S3. Briefly, seven studies took place in high-income countries, and three in low/middle-income countries. Seven studies took place in urban locations. Age was reported in three studies, eight reported on ethnicity, four included smokersand two included women with multiple pregnancies. In three studies, authors reported adjusted ORs from multivariable analyses.

The authors of seven studies reported timing of specimen collection: specimens were obtained during the first trimester in two studies, during the first or second trimester in three, and in the early postpartum period in two studies(table 1, online supplemental table S2). The sample types were endocervical swabs in four studies, urine in threeand vaginal swabs in two studies. In one study, specimen type was unclear. In three studies, women who tested positive for an STI were given antibiotic treatment. In one study in Japan, the authors reported that they gave antibiotics if C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae were detected but not for any Mycoplasma spp alone, that is, in the absence of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. This was also the only study that reported the timing of antibiotic treatment (first or second trimester) (online supplemental table S4).

In all included studies, the authors tested for one or more other STI or genital infections (online supplemental tables S5–S8 report on coinfections with M. genitalium in included studies). C. trachomatis was tested for in all but one studyand was detected in 2.2%–7.5% of women. N. gonorrhoeae was tested for in seven studiesand detected in 0.0%–7.9% of women. In four studies, 0.0%–4.8% of women had positive serological tests for syphilisand in four studies, bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 0.8%–56.0% of women. In six studies, one or more of M. hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, U. parvum, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus type 2 or HIV were also reported(online supplemental table S9).

### High prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in nongonococcal urethritis: the need for routine testing and the inadequacy of current treatment options [^116E6BjX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

METHODS

Patients

This was an observational study of all men prospectively presenting with symptoms of urethritis to the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, between 28 September and 15 December 2011. This study was conducted with the approval of the South West London Research Ethics Committee (number Q0803 71). Patients were designated as having urethritis, NGU, nonchlamydial NGU, or no urethritis. "Urethritis" was defined as any patient receiving treatment specifically for urethritis in that clinical episode and at least 1 of the following: (1) recent history of dysuria, urethral discomfort, or urethral discharge, and visible urethral discharge on examination; (2) ≥ 5 neutrophils per high-power field on urethral Gram stain. NGU was defined as urethritis where gonorrhea was excluded by at least 2 of Gram stain, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and routine gonococcal culture. Nonchlamydial NGU was defined as NGU where chlamydia had been excluded by NAAT. Only patients consenting to routine urethral smears were included in the study. Patients had a urethral smear prepared with a cotton-tipped swab or plastic loop and were asked to provide a maximum of 50 mL first-catch urine specimen. Clinical notes of patients with urethritis were reviewed at 3 months after presentation to assess instances of treatment failure.

Pathogen Detection

First-void urine samples were collected routinely for chlamydia and gonorrhea NAATs using the Viper system (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). The residual of these samples were retrieved and used for detection of M. genitalium and T. vaginalis using primers as previously described. DNA extracts positive for M. genitalium were investigated for SNPs in the quinolone resistance–determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, and parC and macrolide resistance SNPs in 23S rRNA and also typed using a multiple locus variable number tandem repeat marker in MG309 (MG-309-STR) and mgpB SNP analysis. Further details of the protocol are provided in.

Statistical Analysis

To detect the difference of 25% and 4% of M. genitalium in patients with and without urethritis, respectively, with 80% power and α = .05, 111 urethritis and nonurethritis cases each were required. Prevalence of infections was compared between urethritis and no urethritis and also compared within urethritis cases for the same infection, using χ 2 and McNemar test, respectively.

### French prospective clinical evaluation of the aptima Mycoplasma genitalium CE-IVD assay and macrolide resistance detection using three distinct assays [^114ZN7Lu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

is an important sexually transmitted organism involved in nongonococcal urethritis in men and is associated with female cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) that detect-specific nucleic acids in clinical specimens are the only available methods for diagnosis, due to the difficulties in isolatingby culture. Unfortunately, no FDA-approved commercial assays for the detection ofare available yet. However, several NAATs based on real-time PCR or transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) have been described for the molecular detection of. Several companies have commercialized CE-marked multiplex PCR assays for the detection of sexually transmitted pathogens, including. As an alternative to PCR, Hologic, Inc. developed a research-use-only (RUO) TMA assay for the detection of and recently commercialized the AptimaTMA (MG-TMA) assay CE-marked for in vitro diagnosis (CE-IVD), which is available on the Panther platform. Commercial tests that have been CE-marked for document conformity usually suffer from limited clinical validation. Consequently, it is very important that diagnostic laboratories assess the clinical utility of these commercial assays.

Only a few antimicrobial classes have activity against mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas, including tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones.has demonstrated a remarkable capability of developing resistance to almost all antimicrobials used to date, including macrolides and fluoroquinolones. With the increasing prevalence of resistant strains in Europe, the 2016 European guideline oninfections has recommended completing the molecular detection ofwith an assay capable of detecting macrolide-resistance-associated mutations. A variety of methods are available for this purpose.

In the present study, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the clinical performances of the MG-TMA CE-IVD assay (Hologic) for the detection ofin male and female clinical specimens at the Bordeaux University Hospital in comparison with the in-house real-time PCR (in-house PCR) assay routinely used in our laboratory. We also assessed the macrolide-resistance-associated 23S rRNA mutations from-positive specimens using three distinct assays.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^115ceZZC]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Semen samples were collected in sterile containers by masturbation after 2–7 days of abstinence. Sperm Quality Analyzer (SQA-V, Medical Electronic Systems Co. Ltd.) was used for the semen analysis within 60 min after ejaculation and liquefaction, and the semen volume, pH value, sperm concentration, progressive motility (PR), total motion (PR + NP) (NP, Non-progressive motility) and normal morphology were measured by the World Health Organization (WHO, 5th Edition). The seminal leukocytes was detected using the peroxidase method and leukocytospermia was diagnosed by seminal peroxidase-positive leukocyte concentration not less than 1 × 10 6 per mL. Culture appraisal of UU/MH was carried out with urethral swab samples by the modified broth dilution testing methods (Kit provided by Zhuhai Langfeng Biotech Co. Ltd.), and reexamined by the same method at least one week after treatment. Antibiotic sensitivity test results were obtained at high and low concentrations for 12 antibiotics: Cyclolipoerythromycin, Doxycycline, Josamycin, Thiamphenicol, Clarithromycin, Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Roxithromycin, Levofloxacin, Minocycline, Azithromycin and Gatifloxacin. The susceptibility of bacteria to each antibiotic was graded as either susceptible, intermediate or resistant. For UU-positive leukocytospermia patients with doxycycline susceptible, no history of allergies, and contraindications, doxycycline was preferred, and 7-day or 14-day treatment plan (doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days or 14 days, double the first dose) options were selected according to the patient's wishes.

Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24 (IBM Corp. Armonk, New York, United States). Compliance of variables with a normal distribution was analyzed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations (mean ± SD) or medians (25–75%). Categorical variables were represented as numbers with percentages. Continuous data were analyzed by Independent-samples t-test or Paired-samples t-test for normally distributed variables and Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^1142dxhz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility and performed routine semen analysis and UU screening and treatment for patients with leukocytospermia from April 2017 to December 2019. After excluded patients with systemic diseases, cryptorchidism, chromosome abnormalities, varicocele, male azoospermia, bacteriospermia, as well as patients who drank excessively, smoked heavily, had symptoms of genitourinary tract infection or a history of antibiotic use in recent 4 weeks, 1530 patients and medical records were finally collected. Among them, 295 cases were diagnosed with leukocytospermia, 95 cases were further screened for UU-positive, 81 cases were treated with doxycycline, and 14 cases were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between two treatment plans with doxycycline and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared. The study was approved by the ethical review committee.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^112boCTm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Tests of Cure

Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm pathogen eradication, preventing transmission and reinfection. Because NAATs detect both viable and nonviable DNA/RNA, explicit time frames for tests of cure have been outlined, ranging from 7–14 days after therapy for pharyngeal gonorrhea to ≈28 days for chlamydia in pregnant persons. Macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections are cleared relatively quickly after azithromycin therapy; when tests of cure are performed, the timeframe is similar to that for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Australian guidelines recommend a test of cure 14–21 days after treatment.

Benefits of Tests of Cure

The primary benefit of tests of cure is verifying that the organism has been successfully eradicated, which is key for pathogens that cause serious sequelae, particularly during asymptomatic infection. Because M. genitalium sometimes recrudesces after symptoms resolve, a test of cure would identify the need for additional therapy earlier, in turn reducing the risk of infecting sex partners, potentially with resistant strains not detected initially or selected during treatment. Finally, patients might appreciate confirmation that they are cured and not contagious.

Harms of Tests of Cure

A positive test of cure indicates either treatment failure or reinfection. Cases of reinfection are usually retreated with the same antibiotic, whereas cases of treatment failure are typically treated with an alternative antibiotic. When the risk for long-term sequelae is high, the benefit of assuring eradication outweighs the harm of additional antibiotic pressure. When the risk for sequelae is low or uncertain, the potential harm of additional antibiotics might outweigh the benefit of confirming eradication. Despite some evidence that M. genitalium can result in adverse sequelae in women, numerous outstanding questions about natural history remain. These questions include uncertainty over the frequency of upper reproductive tract sequelae, frequency of spontaneous clearance, clinical significance of asymptomatic infections, and transmission risk with low organism load that persists after treatment. Given these outstanding questions, the benefit of tests of cure is currently unknown. The 2021 CDC treatment guidelines only recommend tests of cure when resistance testing is not available and moxifloxacin cannot be used.

Which Antimicrobial Therapies Should Be Used against M. genitalium?

Azithromycin (1 g, 1 dose) was recommended over doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d for 7 days) for M. genitalium in the 2015 treatment guidelines. Moxifloxacin was recommended for azithromycin treatment failures. The 2021 guidelines removed single-dose azithromycin from recommended therapies, primarily because of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

### Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in patients with sterile pyuria [^113AgNyy]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with various diseases of the urogenital tract, but they are usually not detected by routine microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to asses the prevalence of these organisms in patients with sterile pyuria.

Methods

From December 2000 to June 2001 all urine samples sent in to microbiological diagnosis, which yielded ≥ 500 leucocytes/ml and < 10(4) bacteria/ml, were collected for this study. Thirty-three samples from 30 patients (female: 21, male: nine; median age: 60 years, range: 23–91 years) met these criteria and were subjected to PCR for detection of M. hominis and U. urealyticum, respectively.

Results

M. hominis and U. urealyticum were detected in 2 (7%) and 6 samples (20%), respectively. With regard to the underlying diseases of the patients, glomerulonephritis was significantly associated with the detection of urogenital mycoplasmas (p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The prevalence of M. hominis and U. urealyticum found in this study corresponds to the expected prevalence in the general population. This finding does not indicate an association of sterile pyuria with urogenital mycoplasma infection/colonization.

### Suboptimal adherence to doxycycline and treatment outcomes among men with non-gonococcal urethritis: a prospective cohort study [^111qrFUr]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Doxycycline, one of two recommended therapies for non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), consists of a 7-day course of therapy (100 mg BID). Since suboptimal adherence may contribute to poor treatment outcomes, we examined the association between self-reported imperfect adherence to doxycycline and clinical and microbiologic failure among men with NGU.

Methods

Men aged ≥ 16 years with NGU attending a Seattle, WA, sexually transmitted diseases clinic were enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial from January 2007 to July 2011. Men were randomised to active doxycycline/placebo azithromycin or placebo doxycycline/active azithromycin. Imperfect adherence was defined as missing ≥ 1 dose in 7 days. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), and Ureaplasma urealyticum-biovar 2 (UU-2) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical failure (symptoms and ≥ 5 PMNs/HPF or discharge) and microbiologic failure (positive tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

Results

184 men with NGU were randomised to active doxycycline and provided data on adherence. Baseline prevalence of CT, MG and UU-2 was 26%, 13% and 27%, respectively. 28% of men reported imperfect adherence, and this was associated with microbiologic failure among men with CT (aRR = 9.33; 95% CI 1.00 to 89.2) and UU-2 (aRR = 3.08; 95% CI 1.31 to 7.26) but not MG. Imperfect adherence was not significantly associated with clinical failure overall or for any specific pathogens, but it was more common among imperfectly adherent men with CT (aRR = 2.63; 0.93–7.41, p = 0.07).

Conclusions

Adherence may be important for microbiologic cure of select pathogens. Factors other than adherence should be considered for CT-negative men with persistent NGU.

### Diagnostic value of metagenomic next generation sequencing for Ureaplasma urealyticum infection: a case report [^116NJVn4]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum has high nutritional requirements for culture, and it requires special tools for identification. Theoretically, metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to detect many pathogens in clinical specimens, especially for complex infectious diseases with rare and atypical causes. Here, our patient developed severe pneumonia caused by U. urealyticum infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the etiology is unclear. After continuous negative culture, U. urealyticum was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by mNGS, and azithromycin was used. Because of the difficulty in its diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment of extragenital U. urealyticum infection is challenging. In addition, many broad-spectrum antibiotics are ineffective against this pathogen because it lacks a cell wall. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing further complications and deaths.

### Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma screening for pregnant individuals who are at high risk for preterm birth [^1121RmpJ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine gestational age at delivery according to Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma cervical culture results and whether pregnant individuals received antibiotics.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study at a single academic institution where all pregnant individuals with risk factors for preterm birth including those with a history of preterm birth, recurrent pregnancy loss, or pregnancy requiring cervical cerclage were included. We plotted Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate the association between the gestational age at delivery and Ureaplasma culture results (negative; positive and treated; or positive but did not receive the treatment). A Cox proportional regression model was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), controlling for confounders. The main outcome was age at delivery. Analyses were repeated for Mycoplasma culture.

Results

Of 607 individuals, 258 (42.5%) had a negative Ureaplasma culture, 308 (50.7%) had a positive Ureaplasma culture and received treatment, and 41 (6.8%) had a positive Ureaplasma culture and did not receive treatment. Compared with those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture but did not receive treatment, those who had a negative Ureaplasma culture did not have a decreased risk (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.74–1.44). Compared with those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture but did not receive treatment, those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture and received treatment did not have a decreased risk (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66–1.27). The treatment failure rate of Ureaplasma after treatment was 78.6% (95% CI: 72.8–83.7%). Overall, the findings of Mycoplasma were similar.

Conclusion

Routine ureaplasma/mycoplasma cervical culture is not recommended for pregnant individuals who are at high risk for preterm birth.

Key Points

· Ureaplasma/mycoplasma species are isolated in patients with preterm birth. · High ureaplasma/mycoplasma recurrence rate despite treatment with antibiotics. · Treatment of patient and partner did not improve gestational age at delivery.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^1122Cuxy]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

According to the antibiotic sensitivity test of UU, the top three susceptible antibiotics were Cyclolipoerythromycin, Minocycline and Doxycycline, and because doxycycline is inexpensive and easy to obtain, we prefer to choose doxycycline in clinic. According to the results of the 7-day and the 14-day treatment plan, there is no significant difference in cure rates, and there is no significant difference in the effect of the two plans on the sperm quality of UU cured leukocytospermia patients. If patients are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies and contraindications, we think that the doxycycline 7-day treatment plan is a good choice and this antibiotic treatment is meaningful. From our results, the semen parameters such as sperm concentration, PR, total motility, and normal morphology of UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were significantly improved 1 month after UU was cured. Unfortunately, some patients also received antioxidant and other treatments after our observation period, and no correct pregnancy rate was observed. However, our research shows that screening and treating UU in asymptomatic leukocytospermia is meaningful, not only can improve sperm quality but also save a lot of resources and costs, reduce the use of antibiotics, which seems to be an efficient diagnosis and treatment program.

This study has some limitations. Since more pathogens such as chlamydia or mycoplasma have been tested only in symptomatic leukocytespermia rather than asymptomatic leukocytospermia, this may miss some pathogens. In addition, some patients received additional treatments later, and we were unable to follow up with the UU-cured patients for longer periods to obtain more data.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^112VtfYn]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection, as well as asymptomatic leukocytospermia, whether it has effect on semen parameters and whether it needs screening and treatment is still a confusing and controversial topic for clinicians.

Methods

Among 1530 adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility, 295 were diagnosed with asymptomatic leukocytospermia, and 95 were further screened for UU-positive. 81 UU-positive asymptomatic leukocytospermia patients received 7-day or 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline, and 70 cases were cured. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between the two treatment plans and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared.

Results

Compared with non-leukocytospermia patients, the sperm concentration, progressive motility (PR), and normal morphology of patients with leukocytospermia decreased, while those with UU-positive leukocytospermia performed more significantly. The PR, total motility, and normal morphology of UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were significantly lower than those of UU-negative leukocytospermia patients (all p < 0.001). The UU cure rates of the 7-day and 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline was 84.62% and 89.66% (p = 0.738), respectively, and the sperm concentration, PR, total motility, and normal morphology of the cured UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were all increased after 1 month (p = 0.001, p = 0.022, p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions

It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline may be a good choice.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115HKeCK]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In only 60% of the examined samples (26/43 UTI cases) was the organism identified in culture the most prevalent organism in the sample as measured by cfDNA (Fig. 2b). Whereas bacterial culture is skewed toward species that are readily isolated on routine bacteriological media employed for urine culture, cfDNA sequence analyses permit the identification of a broader spectrum of bacterial species. To evaluate this concept further, we assayed two samples collected from one of the subjects included in the analysis above diagnosed with Haemophilus influenzae bacteruria. H. influenzae is a very uncommon uropathogen that does not routinely grow on media employed for conventional urine culture (tryptic soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar). Repeated urine cultures for this patient were negative, but given a urinalysis suggestive of a UTI and given that the patient developed H. influenzae bacteremia, the original urine specimen collected at presentation was re-plated onto chocolate agar, upon which H. influenzae was isolated. In the sample taken at the time of presentation, which was cultured, and also a sample taken 4 days after presentation, we observed H. influenzae cfDNA (0.037 RGE and 0.41 RGE, respectively). This case supports the utility of urinary cfDNA to identify infections where conventional culture fails.

Profiling the urinary microbiome

The urinary tract was regarded as sterile but recent studies have revealed that it often harbors microbiota. We examined the composition of the urinary microbiome by urinary cfDNA profiling (absence of UTI, n = 43) or collected within the first 3 days post-transplant (n = 12) (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that the species-level abundance and the species-level diversity of the bacteriome are a function of the transplant recipient gender but not the donor gender. On average, we observed two to three orders of magnitude more cfDNA from Gardnerella (6125×), Ureaplasma (1686×), and Lactobacillus (321×) across female transplant recipients who did not have a UTI at the time of sampling compared to male recipients who did not have UTI; these bacterial genera have been characterized as microbial components of the vaginal microbiome. We examined the relationship between urine collection methods and the abundance and diversity of the bacteriome and found a notably reduced bacterial load for samples collected by indwelling catheter (samples collected within 4 days after transplant) versus clean-catch urine samples. cfDNA may be an ideal tool to study the urinary microbiome, but future studies need to account for the effects of gender and sample collection approaches.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112kKQCz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to patient-initiated treatment, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering patient-initiated treatment (self-start treatment) in selected patients with rUTIs with acute episodes while awaiting urine cultures.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV / MG test [^116qNPzr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there are no official guidelines or recommendations fortesting in men, if testing becomes readily available then those guidelines may change, and male partners of females diagnosed withinfection can be offered testing with urine or urethral swabs to confirm diagnosis prior to treatment. The clinical significance and utility of the penile meatal swab is currently unknown, although this sample has been shown to have potential utility in a number of studies for the detection ofand other STI pathogens (, N. gonorrhea, and). The collection process for penile meatal swabs may also be more comfortable for patients compared with urethral swab collection.

The high performance of the vaginal swab samples collected in cobas PCR medium indicate that this sampling method is the optimal specimen type for use with the cobas CT/NG assay, which should facilitate ease of testing during a patient clinic visit. Only one sample tested positive with the APTIMA TV alone, in an asymptomatic female patient, who would have been defined by PIS as infected.

As noted, both the clinician-collected and self-collected male meatal and female vaginal swab samples were highly sensitive and specific. This is very important, as self-testing can increase the likelihood that patients will access testing and, in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and rising incidence of STIs, it may be increasingly important in enabling patients to access medical care and diagnosis.

The prevalence ofin this study, at 15.8% in female subjects and 2.3% in male subjects, was higher than some previous estimates ofprevalence, particularly in asymptomatic female subjects, which was 12.1% in this study. The prevalence ofin male subjects was low, as was expected based on data in the literature, and may have been underestimated due to the collection of meatal swabs prior to urine specimens which were used to define infection status. If one assumes that those meatal swabs that gave positive results when the cobas urine result was also positive, but where PIS was negative, were in fact true positives, then positivity would have been 4.2% (41/983). Furthermore, if the 71 meatal samples that were not confirmed with other urine tests were compared head to head with meatal samples using a comparator NAAT (which is a study limitation due to the lack of another FDA-cleared NAAT for the detection ofin men) the positivity would be estimated to be 11.5% (113/983).

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^1132qBK5]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, the real-time PCR method, which previous studies have recommended, was used to investigate the presence of Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma spp. The sensitivity and specificity rates of nucleic acid amplification tests for M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum ranged from 98 to 100% and from 97 to 100%, respectively.

In studies that used the PCR method in male patients with urethritis, the prevalence rates of M. genitalium were 10.5%, 12%, and 23%. The overall prevalence rate of M. genitalium was 10.5% in a study conducted with men who had sex with men. In a study in Southern Ghana that used 2 different kits, the total M. genitalium infection rates were 3.1% and 3.4%. In our study, which included symptomatic men, the M. genitalium positivity rate was 6.4%. The different results between the studies may be due to various factors, such as the patient group selected, the method used, and the patients' risky sexual behaviors.

Routine testing for M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum is not recommended for patients with or without symptoms of urethritis. A high load of U. urealyticum might be associated with urethritis in men. In the literature, the prevalence rate of U. urealyticum ranges widely from approximately 5–28%. In our study, the multiplex PCR method was used in male patients who presented with symptoms of urethritis, and U. urealyticum was found in 19.1% of the patients, which is consistent with the literature. The load of M. hominis showed notable effects on sperm motility, morphology, and leukocyte count. M. hominis can cause infertility in men, even in those who are asymptomatic, but the infertility can be improved with antibiotic treatment. In our study, similar to the literature, the M. hominis and U. parvum colonization rates were 8.5% and 14.9%, respectively.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Impact of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma species on hyperammonemia syndrome in lung transplant recipients: a single center experience [^112Brn19]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Ureaplasma species (spp) has been linked to fatal hyperammonemia syndrome (HS) in lung transplant recipients. We sought to characterize the epidemiology of Ureaplasma spp in candidates and donors and describe outcomes of antimicrobial therapy in preventing and treating HS.

Methods

Candidate testing for Ureaplasma spp was performed with urine culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) pretransplant. Positive candidates were treated with levofloxacin. Donor testing was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture and PCR intraoperatively. From 7/2014 to 2/2017 patients were treated according to results; from 2/2017 to 10/2018 recipients received empiric levofloxacin and azithromycin at transplant until testing returned negative. HS was defined as new onset altered mental status after transplant with ammonia > 200 µmol/L.

Results

In total, 60 patients who underwent lung transplant were included. And 80% (n = 48) of patients had negative screening tests in donor and candidate pre-lung transplant, 8.3% (n = 5) of recipients had positive Ureaplasma spp testing in urine pre-transplant, and 13.3% (n = 8) had positive donor BAL testing at the time of lung transplant. Three patients developed HS a median of 7 days posttransplant; 2 died of HS. Recipients of organs with Ureaplasma spp who received empiric therapy did not develop HS. Donors with Ureaplasma spp were younger and more sexually active.

Conclusions

Donor-derived Ureaplasma spp in lung transplant was associated with HS. Screening lung donors for Ureaplasma spp might allow for targeted therapy to reduce risk for development of HS, but future confirmatory studies are needed.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — posttreatment urine culture and test-of-cure: The Canadian Urological Association guidelines suggest repeating a urine culture 1 to 2 weeks after treatment to test for persistence, and a negative posttreatment urine culture provides evidence of effective treatment; in the absence of a negative posttreatment urine culture, it is possible that a 2 or 3 UTI episodes are related to a single persistent uropathogen, though some experts recommend against posttreatment testing to lessen antibiotic exposure, noting in a randomized trial that treated young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria were more likely to develop subsequent infections and more likely to develop antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^112ua8gn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding optimal antimicrobial selection is limited by lack of standardized methods and clinical breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, clinical data on the treatment of these organisms are limited to case reports and series, with limited data on clinical or microbiological response. Beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin are inactive because they target the cell wall. Myoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. are generally susceptible to agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Fluoroquinolones, which are bactericidal against mycoplasmas should be considered for empiric treatment. Doxycycline should also be considered, although resistance may be increasing. It is reasonable to use combination therapy (eg, moxifloxacin and doxycycline).

What is the diagnosis?

Answer:

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species infections.

Case 1 had a Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum pelvic collection and metalware infection, and left hip septic arthritis (culture and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] positive). We propose that instrumentation of the genitourinary tract with a urinary catheter led to hematogenous metastatic seeding of these organisms. He was managed with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, and his fevers subsided and pain improved.

Case 2 had a M. hominis and Ureaplasma species retroperitoneal urinoma likely secondary to the ongoing urinary leak. The patient was commenced on doxycycline and demonstrated clinical improvement.

### Ureaplasma and BPD [^114Vinwf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma is an organism with low virulence and is a commensal of the lower genito-urinary tract in females. From here, it can gain entry in the amniotic fluid to cause inflammation in the amniotic compartment during pregnancy. Ureaplasma spp. are the most common organisms isolated from women with chorioamnionitis. Ureaplasma spp. are associated with increased risk for preterm labor and morbidity in the preterm neonate. However, there is some controversy regarding the importance of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This article will review the microbiology of Ureaplasma, host innate immune responses, and the pathology of lung injury in animal models of Ureaplasma chorioamnionitis. We will review epidemiological studies of Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants and efficacy of antibiotics in preventing preterm labor and BPD.

Diagnostic Considerations

Culture can be used to test urogenital and extragenital sites for girls and boys. NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae from vaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine for boys (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Although data regarding NAAT from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among children are more limited, and performance is test dependent, no evidence supports that performance of NAAT for detection of N. gonorrhoeae among children differs from that among adults. Because of the implications of a N. gonorrhoeae diagnosis in a child, only validated FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be used with extragenital specimens. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT to minimize the possibility of cross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals (e.g. N. meningitidis, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of results.

Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. If evidence of DGI exists, gonorrhea culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be obtained from relevant clinical sites (see Disseminated Gonococcal Infection).

Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Vulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis Among Infants and Children Weighing ≤ 45 kg
Ceftriaxone 25–50 mg/kg body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 250 mg IM
Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Vulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis Among Children Weighing > 45 kg
Treat with the regimen recommended for adults (see Gonococcal Infections)
Recommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among Children Weighing ≤ 45 kg
Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg body weight (maximum dose: 2 g) IM or IV in a single dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days
Recommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among Children Weighing > 45 kg
Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV in a single dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days

Other Management Considerations

Follow-up cultures are unnecessary. Only parenteral cephalosporins (i.e. ceftriaxone) are recommended for use among children. All children identified as having gonococcal infections should be tested for C. trachomatis, syphilis, and HIV (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113BjkNG]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — pregnant persons versus nonpregnant adults: Urine culture is the established method for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria. In pregnant persons, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria reduces the incidence of pyelonephritis, the overall benefits can be bounded as no greater than moderate in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has a moderate net benefit. In nonpregnant adults, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria has no benefit, overall harms can be bounded as at least small in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no benefit and may be harmful.

Initial Examination

Visual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas for genital discharge, odor, bleeding, irritation, warts, and ulcerative lesions should be performed during initial examination. The clinical manifestations of certain STIs are different for children than for adults. For example, typical vesicular lesions might be absent even in the presence of HSV infection. The following should be performed during the initial examination, if STI testing is indicated:

Testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can be performed from specimens collected from the pharynx and rectum, as well as the vagina for girls and urine for boys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for prepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a meatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for an intraurethral swab specimen. Culture or NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Although data regarding NAAT for children are more limited and performance is test dependent, no evidence demonstrates that performance of NAAT for detection of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis among children differs from that among adults. Only FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be used. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT in this context, both to minimize the possibility of cross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals (e.g. N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. lactamica, N. cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of results. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection in a child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used. If culture for the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is performed, only standard culture procedures should be followed. Specimens from the vagina, urethra, pharynx, or rectum should be streaked onto selective media for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae, and all presumptive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be identified definitively by at least two tests that involve different approaches (e.g. biochemical, enzyme substrate, or molecular probes). Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. Specimens (either NAAT or culture, including any isolates) obtained before treatment should be preserved for further validation if needed. When a specimen is positive, the result should be confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or obtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among children, false-positive results can occur, and all specimens that are initially positive should be confirmed.
Testing for T. vaginalis should not be limited to girls with vaginal discharge if other indications for vaginal testing exist because evidence indicates that asymptomatic sexually abused children might be infected with T. vaginalis and might benefit from treatment. NAAT can be used as an alternative or in addition to culture and wet mount, especially in settings where culture and wet mount of vaginal swab specimens are not obtainable. Data regarding use of NAATs for detection of T. vaginalis among children are limited; however, no evidence indicates that performance of NAAT for detection of T. vaginalis for children would differ from that for adults. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT in this context to ensure correct interpretation of results. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection in a child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used. POC tests for T. vaginalis have not been validated for prepubertal children and should not be used. In the case of a positive specimen, the result should be confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or obtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence of T. vaginalis among children, false-positive results can occur, and all specimens that are initially positive should be confirmed.
HSV can be indicative of sexual abuse; therefore, specimens should be obtained from all vesicular or ulcerative genital or perianal lesions and sent for NAAT or viral culture.
Wet mount can be used for a vaginal swab specimen for BV if discharge is present.
Collection of serum samples should be evaluated, preserved for subsequent analysis, and used as a baseline for comparison with follow-up serologic tests. Sera can be tested for antibodies to T. pallidum, HIV, and HBV. Decisions regarding the infectious agents for which to perform serologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.

### Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2015 [^112SoQDV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2015). Low credibility.

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were updated by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on April 30-May 2, 2013. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59 [No. RR-12]). These updated guidelines discuss 1) alternative treatment regimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 2) the use of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis; 3) alternative treatment options for genital warts; 4) the role of Mycoplasma genitalium in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; 5) updated HPV vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) the management of persons who are transgender; 7) annual testing for hepatitis C in persons with HIV infection; 8) updated recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of urethritis; and 9) retesting to detect repeat infection. Physicians and other health-care providers can use these guidelines to assist in the prevention and treatment of STDs.

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^116kKkKC]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Genital discharge is one of the most common symptoms of urethritis and can be caused by various pathogenic agents of STI. Manhart et al. reported that in men with M. genitalium urogenital infection, the most common symptom was urethral discharge (20.4%). Rietmeijer et al. found a significant relationship between urethral discharge and N. gonorrhoeae positivity. In our study, a statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of genital discharge and N. gonorrhoeae and U. urealyticum positivity (p < 0.05).

The main risk factors of STIs include age between 20 and 35 years, having multiple partners, and a history of STI. de Souza et al. found that pathogenic agents of STI were most common in the 20 to 29 year age group, and Manhart et al. found that M. genitalium was most common in the 15 to 24 year age group. Among the patients in our study who tested positive for any of the microorganisms, those in the 26 to 34 year age group had the highest prevalence rate. The differences between age groups may be due to various reasons, such as the time of initiation of sexual activity, sociocultural features, and the sexual behavior characteristics of individuals in different populations. Risky sexual behaviors, especially increasing the number of sexual partners, are known to increase the risk of STIs. Several studies have found a correlation between the number of sexual partners and the risk of M. genitalium infection. In our study, a statistically significant relationship was found between having 3 or more partners in the previous year and M. genitalium and N. gonorrhoeae positivity (p < 0.05).

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^113Tji7V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

Infants were recruited from seven sites over 37 months (July 2013–August 2016). A total of 982 patients were screened, of whom 434 (44%) were eligible (online supplementary figure 1S). Of 121 randomised, 60 were assigned to azithromycin and 61 were assigned to placebo; 119 (98%) received at least one dose of assigned treatment, one in each treatment group did not receive any doses of assigned treatment and treatment was discontinued in four azithromycin participants (one parent request and three clinical team request). All participants who received < 3 doses were Ureaplasma negative. One placebo-assigned infant who was nasopharyngeal Ureaplasma positive received a single dose of azithromycin due to pharmacy error.

The baseline characteristics of randomised patients and stratified by Ureaplasma status are summarised in table 1. An imbalance in race distribution occurred with 40% non-white in the azithromycin versus 75% in the placebo group. Other baseline characteristics were similar comparing treatment arms for the entire study cohort and when stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study participants for the total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma status

Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive at one or more time points with 19 (32%) randomised to azithromycin and 25 (41%) to placebo (table 1 and online supplementary figure 2S). Ureaplasma prevalence was higher in the 24 0–26 6 weeks' gestation stratum compared with 27 0–28 6 weeks (36/83 (43%) vs 8/38 (21%), p = 0.02). Ureaplasma parvum was the most common species detected in both treatment arms (U. parvum, n = 33 (75%); U. urealyticum n = 7 (16%); both species, n = 3 (7%); untyped n = 1 (2%)). The Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 and MIC 90 for Ureaplasma isolates were 2 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL, respectively. No tested isolate was resistant to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL).

### The significance of Ureaplasma urealyticum as a pathogenic agent in the paediatric population [^115Gm4Ld]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ureaplasma urealyticum is a frequent commensal in the lower genital tract of sexually active women. It may be transmitted perinatally from the colonized mother to her offspring, often resulting in prematurity and neonatal disease. The microorganism also sustains a causative role for infectious diseases in older children.

Recent Findings

U. urealyticum infection can be diagnosed by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and the detection of specific antibodies. Neonatal infection has been implicated in various pathological conditions including pneumonia, chronic lung disease, central nervous system disorders, sepsis, osteomyelitis and even death. Older children may present with wheezing, pneumonitis, pertussis-like syndrome and different forms of arthritis. Large well-designed trials have demonstrated that the regular administration of antibiotics to vaginally colonized women are not beneficial in terms of preventing preterm labour. Macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens are, however, recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Erythromycin treatment of ureaplasma respiratory colonized premature infants shows no reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease. Treatment of central nervous system infections, sepsis and arthritides includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively.

Summary

This review covers recent evidence concerning the role of U. urealyticum as a pathogen during childhood. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches.

Methods

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by 2 types of key questions (Table): informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator (L.E.M.) reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion. All authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

Between August 2013 and June 2015, 70 potentially-eligible participants were included in this study (see Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Out of these, WD was clinically considered a differential diagnosis in 27 participants, but no laboratory finding supported the diagnosis, and therefore they were grouped to the controls. Samples from all remaining 43 participants, including the index patient, were referred to the German Consiliary Laboratory (Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin) and Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin for Tropheryma whipplei testing and were categorized into 3 groups according to their treatment status (Table 1): Group 1 consisted of newly-diagnosed WD patients who received no antibiotic treatment (n = 12), Group 2 consisted of newly-diagnosed WD patients who received a short-term antibiotic treatment (up to 14 days, n = 10), and Group 3 consisted of patients who had received treatment previously for 3–12 months (n = 21).

Table 1.
Patient and Control Group

All patients were asked as soon as possible after diagnosis to send their first-void urine and matched stool samples for an extended diagnostic work-up and molecular analysis. For most of the WD patients, creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in the blood were assessed (see Supplementary Table S1).

In total, 110 subjects were included as controls in the study and were divided into 3 further groups: Group 4 consisted of patients for whom a diagnosis of WD was excluded due to negative findings in diverse materials (n = 27 as mentioned above); Group 5 consisted of patients with acute gastroenteritis (n = 43); and Group 6 consisted of healthy volunteers (n = 40).

The study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of the Charité. All authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^11652TaU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Gonorrhea and Chlamydia

The following testing is recommended for MSM:

A test for urethral infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred).
A test for rectal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred).
A test for pharyngeal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).
Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended.

Basing screening practices solely on history might be suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable taking a detailed sexual history, men might also feel uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with their provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be identified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors. Furthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e. oral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis has not been well studied.

Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-collected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis.

More frequent STI screening (i.e. for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g. every 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

Hepatitis B Virus

All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV infection. Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection or vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can be considered before vaccinating if the patient's vaccination history is unknown; however, vaccination should not be delayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection or vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related adverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).

### Liquid-based urine cytology as a tool for detection of human papillomavirus, Mycoplasma spp., and Ureaplasma spp. in men [^111qQXzs]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Liquid-based urine cytology (LB-URC) was evaluated for cytological diagnosis and detection of human papillomavirus (HPV), Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma. Midstream urine samples were collected from 141 male patients with urethritis and 154 controls without urethritis, and sediment cells were preserved in liquid-based cytology solution. Urethral swabs from urethritis patients were tested for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Papanicolaou tests were performed for cytological evaluation. HPV, Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma genomes were determined by PCR-based methods, and localization of HPV DNA in urothelial cells was examined by in situ hybridization (ISH). The β-globin gene was positive in 97.9% of LB-URC samples from urethritis patients and in 97.4% of control samples, suggesting that high-quality cellular DNA was obtained from the LB-URC samples. HPV DNA was detected in 29 (21.0%) urethritis cases and in five (3.3%) controls (P < 0.05). HPV type 16 (HPV 16) was most commonly found in urethritis patients. Cytological evaluations could be performed for 92.1% of urethritis patients and 64.3% of controls. Morphological changes suggestive of HPV infection were seen in 20.7% of the HPV-positive samples, and ISH demonstrated the presence of HPV DNA in both squamous and urothelial cells in HPV-positive samples. Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were detected in 14.5%, 10.9%, 6.5%, and 12.3% of urethritis patients, respectively. The prevalence rates of these microorganisms (except Ureaplasma parvum) were significantly higher in urethritis cases than controls (P < 0.05). LB-URC is applicable for detection of HPV, Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma. HPV infection occurs in urothelial cells, especially in gonococcal urethritis.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Urine nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections in clinical practice [^117AEfUZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With the advent of highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification assays, this report will demonstrate that self-collected genital specimens, such as urine or even vaginal swabs can be accurately used to diagnose sexually transmitted infections.

Recent Findings

Use of self collected samples can eliminate the necessity of a clinician to perform a pelvic examination for women or collect a urethral swab for men, thus extending the diagnostic capability for sexually transmitted infections to non-clinic screening venues. As many sexually transmitted infections are asymptomatic, this ability to use self-sampling greatly increases the numbers of patients that can be screened, and has the potential to augment public health programs designed to control the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections in the community. Patient collected samples are highly acceptable, highly accurate, and are becoming widely used. Self-sampling also allows clinicians to easily screen patients in the clinic, who are not presenting for pelvic or urogenital examinations, for sexually transmitted infections.

Summary

Highly accurate molecular tests and easily obtained self-collected urogenital samples represent the ideal combination for obtaining the public health goal of decreasing the sexually transmitted infection epidemic among sexually active persons in the United States today.

### The urinary microbiome: improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^111pQV8y]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biologic sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, amongst the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. The new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — laboratory reporting limits and interpretation: Many laboratories will not report colony counts < 10^3 CFU/mL, and strict use of a low threshold is likely to lead to overdiagnosis; therefore, determining whether a standard urine culture represents clinically significant bacteriuria must factor the clinical presentation, urine collection method, and suggestive findings such as pyuria and urinary nitrites.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1137Po8y]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) diagnostics and susceptibility testing — molecular assays offer speed but carry risks and are not yet replacements for culture: there is "significant concern that adoption of this technology in the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms may lead to overtreatment with antibiotics", and "These tests, however, are not well-proven enough to displace standard urine culture as the gold standard for UTI diagnosis". Accuracy may improve via combinations, as "Combination of bacterial detection with biomarker assessments may provide far greater diagnostic utility than either test alone", and propidium monoazide (PMA) pretreatment before PCR "significantly reduced the detection of DNA from dead bacteria", with "Viability-qPCR may dramatically improve the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic testing". For antibiotic selection, "Culture-based phenotypic susceptibility results do not account for the presence of transiently silenced resistance genes", while "genotypic resistance assessments may miss resistance-conferring genes", and comparative studies show "a low average concordance… (ranging from 20.7% to 84.6%)". A "composite approach combining genetic and phenotypic methods was recently validated to demonstrate high agreement with standard antibiotic susceptibility testing", although "it has yet to be validated in clinical scenarios".

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117CjqAr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113k9V86]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

ASB — general management and indications for screening/treatment: A recent systematic review concluded that antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) does not appear to improve microbiologic outcomes, morbidity, or mortality, and current evidence indicates that screening/treatment of ASB does not reduce urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, morbidity, or mortality in patients with complicating factors. In a large cohort of hospitalized patients with ASB and no systemic signs of infections, female patients without vital sign abnormalities or leukocytosis had a predicted probability of bacteremia of 2% or less. The only clearly recognized indications for screening/treatment of ASB are 1) pregnant women, and 2) patients undergoing elective urologic surgery, and symptoms such as malodorous and/or cloudy urine, although associated with bacteriuria, do not warrant treatment.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116cc9Lu]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among the general adult population, women (across all ages) have the highest prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with age among both men and women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women. Among pregnant persons, pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth.

Objective

To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults, including pregnant persons.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications. There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment and changes in the microbiome) to be at least small in magnitude. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no net benefit. The known harms associated with treatment include adverse effects of antibiotic use and changes to the microbiome. Based on these known harms, the USPSTF determined the overall harms to be at least small in this group.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening pregnant persons for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. (D recommendation).

### Ureaplasma infection and neonatal lung disease [^115HDroz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infection with the ureaplasmas may occur in utero or perinatally in prematurely born infants. For some infants, infection with these organisms triggers a vigorous pro-inflammatory response in the lungs and increases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). At present, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine whether antibiotic treatment of Ureaplasma has any influence on the development of BPD and its comorbidities. Future investigation in the context of well-designed, adequately powered controlled clinical trials should focus on determining whether treatment of ureaplasmal infection lessens lung inflammation, decreases rates of BPD, and improves long-term, neurodevelopmental outcome.

### Ureaplasma urealyticum is associated with nongonococcal urethritis among men with fewer lifetime sexual partners: a case-control study [^1171fLUZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ureaplasmas have been inconsistently associated with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). We evaluated the association of the newly differentiated species Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Ureaplasma parvum (UP) with NGU using 2 separate control groups.

Methods

Case patients were men who attended a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Seattle, Washington, during the period 2007–2009 with NGU (defined as visible urethral discharge and/or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear neutrophils per high-powered field; n = 329). Control subjects were STD clinic attendees (n = 191) and emergency department (ED) attendees (n = 193) without NGU. Polymerase chain reaction assays detected UU and UP in ureaplasma culture-positive urine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations of UU and UP with NGU.

Results

UU was only marginally associated with NGU in aggregate multivariable analyses, irrespective of control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR](STD-control), 1.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.9–2.8]; aOR(ED-control), 1.7 [95% CI, 0.97–3.0]). This association was significantly stronger when analyses were restricted to men with fewer lifetime sex partners (< 10 vaginal partners: aOR(STD-control), 2.9 [95% CI, 1.2–6.7]; aOR(ED-control), 3.2 [95% CI, 1.3–7.6]; < 5 vaginal partners: aOR(STD-control), 6.2 [95% CI, 1.8–21.0]; aOR(ED-control), 5.2 [95% CI, 1.3–20.2]). UP was not positively associated with NGU overall or among subgroups.

Conclusions

The absence of an association of UU with NGU among men with more lifetime sex partners suggests that adaptive immunity may attenuate the clinical manifestation of UU infection. Similar relationships were not observed with UP, which suggests that it is not a urethral pathogen.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114EP4of]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to choice of antibiotics, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend to consider administering culture-directed parenteral antibiotic therapy for as short a duration as reasonable, generally no longer than 7 days, in patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### 2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^1165mEsB]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to NAATs, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to use first-void urine specimens for men (up to 20 mL sampled ≥ 1 hour after previous micturition) and vulvo-vaginal swabs for women (either healthcare worker- or self-collected) as the first choice for diagnosis of urogenital chlamydial infections with NAATs.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113zoJEq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).
