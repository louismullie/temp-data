## Question

dyslipidemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step approach to managing dyslipidemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define dyslipidemia and classify cardiovascular risk. Then, I should verify lifestyle interventions and their role relative to pharmacotherapy. Next, I will examine first-line statin therapy by risk category, followed by treatment intensification with nonstatins and targets or thresholds. After that, I should address special populations and secondary causes, then adherence and monitoring strategies. Finally, I will integrate emerging therapies and summarize practical implementation steps, making sure each claim aligns with guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification framework. Dyslipidemia typically encompasses elevated LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL, low HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, or triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL, and in patients with established CVD or high risk, even "normal" lipids warrant intervention to reduce events, so risk-based management is foundational rather than lipid-level-only approaches [^115x5uqj] [^112FsdCg]. Hold on, I should verify risk categories because they drive intensity; contemporary guidance places patients into low, borderline, intermediate, high, and very high risk, with diabetes, established ASCVD, and severe hypercholesterolemia typically placing patients into higher risk tiers for treatment decisions and goals [^1155K4fP].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy as first-line for all. Wait, let me verify the elements: Mediterranean-style dietary patterns, regular aerobic activity, weight management, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol are repeatedly emphasized, with structured programs improving adherence and outcomes, and these should be initiated in parallel or just before pharmacotherapy depending on risk urgency [^113kNSbh] [^115Mun6q]. I need to ensure the timing is right; for very high-risk patients, drug therapy may start concurrently with lifestyle changes, whereas others should have a 3–6 month lifestyle trial before medications, reassessing lipids every 4–12 months to gauge response and adherence [^115Mun6q] [^117LmuJC].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy. Statin therapy remains the cornerstone, with intensity chosen by risk: moderate-intensity statins typically lower LDL-C by 30–49% and high-intensity by ≥ 50%, and statins are first-line in essentially all patients who warrant pharmacotherapy for ASCVD risk reduction [^1154wzMH] [^115x5uqj]. Let me think about primary versus secondary prevention thresholds; the ACC/AHA multisociety guidance supports high-intensity statins for secondary prevention and for primary prevention in high-risk adults, including those with diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and supports moderate-intensity statins for borderline- to intermediate-risk adults with risk enhancers, using shared decision-making to incorporate patient values and potential benefits [^1155K4fP] [^115mFwBk]. Hold on, I should verify that statin choice accounts for age, comorbidities, and drug interactions, with high-intensity preferred in those ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD when tolerated and moderate-intensity reasonable in older adults based on frailty and polypharmacy considerations [^115vtFC5].

> Next, I should review intensification beyond statins and whether to use targets or thresholds. Let me verify the risk-reduction principle: for every ~38.7 mg/dL LDL-C reduction, major vascular events fall by about 22%, supporting more aggressive lowering in higher-risk patients and favoring treat-to-target strategies in many guidelines [^117XuUuN]. I should double-check target levels: for very high-risk ASCVD, an LDL-C goal < 55 mg/dL is recommended by ESC/EAS, whereas < 70 mg/dL is commonly used in other societies, and many adopt non–HDL-C as a co-primary target, especially when triglycerides are elevated, with AACE endorsing < 70 mg/dL in adults with ASCVD or at increased risk and suggesting conditional goals of < 55 mg/dL in select populations [^115v86mc] [^116U8Lqy] [^115htaqc]. But wait, what if we prefer thresholds to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment; the VA/DoD guideline argues that evidence maps better to treatment intensity than fixed LDL-C targets, and this is a valid counterpoint, so clinicians should reconcile guideline philosophy with patient-specific risk and preferences [^111vR1iX].

> Now, I should confirm add-on therapies and the sequence. Ezetimibe is the preferred first add-on when LDL-C remains above goal on maximally tolerated statin, with IMPROVE-IT demonstrating incremental event reduction when added to statin therapy, and it is reasonable even in primary prevention when LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL despite statins [^114yVDBb] [^112WPdDc]. Hold on, I should verify PCSK9 inhibitors; they are recommended in very high-risk secondary prevention patients who do not reach LDL-C goals on statin plus ezetimibe, with outcome trials showing ~15–20% relative risk reduction in events without mortality benefit, and are generally not recommended for primary prevention due to limited outcome data and cost [^111tYf2M] [^111oY3nq] [^111mx3Bq]. Bempedoic acid can be considered as an oral add-on or alternative in statin-intolerant patients, and inclisiran is an emerging siRNA option with LDL-C lowering but awaits more definitive outcome data before routine use in all settings [^112WPdDc] [^116RRBuT].

> I need to check triglyceride management because residual risk often includes hypertriglyceridemia. For severe hypertriglyceridemia ≥ 500 mg/dL, prioritize pancreatitis prevention with very low-fat diet, alcohol abstinence, glycemic control, and consider fibrates or high-dose omega-3s, while for persistent triglycerides 135–499 mg/dL in secondary prevention with diabetes or multiple risk factors, add icosapent ethyl to statin therapy given REDUCE-IT's event reduction, noting controversy around placebo formulation and discordant results from STRENGTH, which tempers certainty and underscores shared decision-making [^111g27S2] [^115v86mc]. Let me reconsider fibrates; outside of severe triglycerides, outcome data for fibrates on top of statins are mixed, so they are generally reserved for specific phenotypes or when triglycerides remain high despite lifestyle and statins, with careful attention to interactions and adverse effects [^111g27S2].

> Next, I should review special populations and secondary causes. Familial hypercholesterolemia warrants early diagnosis and aggressive LDL-C lowering, often requiring combination therapy and early consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors in very high-risk patients who fail to reach goals with statin plus ezetimibe, per ESC/EAS guidance [^111YmJHB] [^1128d2bD]. In diabetes, ADA 2025 recommends high-intensity statins to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and an LDL-C < 70 mg/dL in higher-risk adults aged 40–75 years, with attention to triglycerides and non–HDL-C given the atherogenic dyslipidemia pattern [^116N6NtW]. For older adults, I should confirm that intensity is individualized; moderate-intensity statins are often reasonable in those ≥ 80 years with secondary prevention needs, balancing frailty, polypharmacy, and patient preference, and CAC scoring can refine risk in borderline cases [^111XpJM9]. Women have high lifetime risk despite lower short-term event rates, so primary prevention strategies are critical, and I should ensure we do not undertreat based on age alone [^1167Rjd7]. Finally, I must screen for secondary causes such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and medications that worsen lipids before labeling primary dyslipidemia [^111xoZLZ].

> I will now examine adherence and monitoring because implementation gaps are substantial. Many high- and very high-risk patients remain above LDL-C thresholds despite statins, and only a minority receive timely intensification, highlighting the need for structured follow-up every 4–12 months, explicit LDL-C goals, and team-based care with pharmacists and nurses to improve persistence and uptitration [^111LRNyB] [^117LmuJC]. Hold on, I should verify whether repeated lipid testing changes management; given biological and analytical variability, infrequent testing is reasonable once stable, but in higher-risk or actively changing regimens, periodic checks support adherence verification and timely intensification [^117LmuJC].

> Let me consider emerging therapies and controversies so I don't overstate unproven options. Inclisiran provides durable PCSK9 suppression and substantial LDL-C lowering but lacks definitive outcome data for broad adoption; ongoing trials and cost-effectiveness analyses will clarify its role, especially in primary prevention or as an alternative to injectables [^116RRBuT]. Antisense and small interfering RNA therapies targeting apoC-III and ANGPTL3 show promise for severe hypertriglyceridemia and related dyslipidemias, yet outcome trials are pending and current use should be restricted to research or highly selected refractory cases, underscoring the need for pragmatism in selecting interventions with proven event reduction [^112hhBi1].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and ensure internal consistency. For secondary prevention or very high-risk primary prevention, start high-intensity statin, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL, and consider PCSK9 inhibitor or bempedoic acid if still above goal or statin-intolerant, targeting < 55–70 mg/dL depending on guideline and patient preference, with explicit plans for follow-up and adherence support [^111tYf2M] [^112WPdDc]. For primary prevention, calculate 10-year risk, initiate moderate- to high-intensity statin when risk is borderline or intermediate with risk enhancers or ≥ 7.5–12.5% depending on tool, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains ≥ 190 mg/dL or goals are unmet, and escalate to PCSK9 therapy selectively in very high-risk primary prevention such as FH with multiple risk factors, always anchoring decisions in shared decision-making and cost considerations [^1155K4fP] [^114sTAgR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to fixed LDL-C targets for everyone; I should confirm that some guidelines prefer intensity-based treatment and threshold approaches, so documenting the rationale for target versus threshold use in the chart maintains transparency with patients and aligns with the evidence philosophy each clinician adopts [^111vR1iX] [^113C6sUg].

Dyslipidemia is defined by abnormal lipid levels — elevated LDL-C, non-HDL-C, or triglycerides, or low HDL-C — and is a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [^115x5uqj] [^111onMi6]. Management centers on **lifestyle first** (diet, activity, weight, smoking cessation) and **statins as first-line** pharmacotherapy to reduce ASCVD risk in proportion to LDL-C lowering [^111onMi6] [^115Mun6q]. Nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, omega-3s) are added when LDL-C or triglyceride goals are unmet or intolerance occurs, with targets individualized by risk category [^112WPdDc] [^111g27S2]. Persistent undertreatment and adherence gaps remain; **risk-based, patient-centered care** with regular monitoring improves outcomes [^111LRNyB] [^114mRFdm].

---

## Definition and classification

Dyslipidemia refers to abnormal lipid levels, including:

- **Elevated LDL-C**: ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) in general population; ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in ASCVD or high risk [^112oADnC].
- **Low HDL-C**: < 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in men; < 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women.
- **Elevated triglycerides**: ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L); severe ≥ 500 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) [^112oADnC].

Classification is **risk-based**, with categories including low, moderate, high, and very high risk based on ASCVD history, diabetes, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and calculated 10-year risk [^114ge5vY].

---

## Pathophysiology

Dyslipidemia promotes atherosclerosis via **elevated LDL-C**, which infiltrates the arterial wall, becomes oxidized, and is taken up by macrophages, forming foam cells and plaques [^notfound]. Elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C further increase ASCVD risk [^112S8hz4].

---

## Clinical consequences

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for **ASCVD**, including coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease [^notfound]. It also increases the risk of acute pancreatitis when triglycerides are severely elevated (≥ 500 mg/dL) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

First-line therapy includes:

- **Diet**: Mediterranean or DASH; reduce saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbs; increase soluble fiber and omega-3s [^113kNSbh].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^111ykjRF].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Mechanism** | **Ldl-c reduction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Statins | First-line for ASCVD risk reduction | HMG-CoA reductase inhibition | 30–50% (moderate); ≥ 50% (high) [^1154wzMH] |
| Ezetimibe | Add-on or statin-intolerant | Intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibition | 15–25% [^notfound] |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | Very high risk or statin-intolerant | Increased LDL receptor recycling | 50–70% [^notfound] |
| Bempedoic acid | Add-on or statin-intolerant | ATP citrate lyase inhibition | 18–28% [^notfound] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | Severe hypertriglyceridemia | Reduced hepatic triglyceride synthesis | 20–45% [^notfound] |

---

Treatment targets are **individualized by risk**: very high risk aims for LDL-C < 55 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; high risk for < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; moderate risk for < 100 mg/dL or a ≥ 30% reduction [^111uQYrr] [^111g27S2].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Lipid panels should be checked **every 3–12 months** to assess adherence and treatment response, with therapy adjusted to meet individualized goals [^117LmuJC] [^11732gEi].

---

## Challenges and controversies

- **Adherence**: Poor adherence limits effectiveness; patient education and shared decision-making improve persistence [^114mHAPQ].
- **Statin intolerance**: Common; manage with alternative agents or lower doses [^111CDvVj].
- **Residual risk**: Persists despite LDL-C control; address triglycerides, HDL-C, and Lp(a) [^111g27S2].
- **Cost and access**: PCSK9 inhibitors and other novel agents are expensive and may limit use [^115jrj21].

---

Dyslipidemia is a key modifiable risk factor for ASCVD; **risk-based, patient-centered care** with lifestyle and pharmacotherapy — intensified to individualized goals — reduces events, though adherence and access barriers persist [^111k11S8].

### Effectiveness of aggressive management of dyslipidemia in a collaborative-care practice model [^115VSkfY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The Cardiovascular Risk Identification and Treatment Center was established in 1997, adopting a collaborative-care clinic model for the purpose of improving the management of high-risk patients with dyslipidemia. This was a retrospective analysis of 417 high-risk patients with ≥ 1 year of follow-up laboratory data. Analysis included changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio; lipoprotein goal achievement; Framingham risk score; liver function; and cardiovascular events. At baseline, 66% of patients had coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent risk, 45% were not receiving dyslipidemia therapy, and 29% were on statin monotherapy. After 3 years in the program, 56% were receiving combination therapy, 41% were on monotherapy, and 2% were not on therapy. The 3 most common treatment regimens were statin plus niacin (36%), statin alone (22%), and niacin alone (14%). All lipoproteins improved from baseline (p < 0.001). Overall, 62% to 74% of patients reached singular lipid goals and 35% achieved combined lipid goals. Patients with Framingham 10-year CHD risk of > 20% were reduced from 6% to < 1%. Only 29 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular event, including 5 (1.0%) who experienced a myocardial infarction. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transferase elevation > 3 times normal occurred in 1% of patients. In conclusion, a collaborative-care practice model adopting individualized, aggressive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies is highly effective in achieving lipid goals, is sustainable, and is safe. Furthermore, this approach yields reduced projected 10-year CHD risk. A low rate of cardiovascular events was observed.

In summary, statins firmly remain the first line treatment of choice for attainment of LDL-C goal in patients at high risk of CVD. After LDL-C goal attainment however, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, as defined by recent European guidelines) and HDL-C low (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, then addition of a fibrate or niacin may be considered (Figure 6).

Proposed algorithm for the management of high-risk individuals with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol at LDL cholesterol goal. a LDL-C at goal as recommended by the most recent European guidelines (2007); < 2.5 mmol/L in high-risk patients, decreasing to < 2.0 mmol/L in very high risk patients. High-dose omega-3 fatty acids, fibrate, or niacin may be considered if the patient has very high TG (> 5.0 mmol/L) to prevent pancreatitis. b If the patient still has elevated TG (≥ 1.7 mmol/L, as recommended by the most recent European guidelines) and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, and addressing compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, additional lipid-modifying therapy may be considered. c Based on clinical outcome data and safety considerations for combination statin–fibrate therapy, fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate. This fibrate may have particular value in patients with T2DM and mild-to-moderate retinopathy. d Greater LDL-C lowering may be achieved by the addition of ezetimibe to a statin. Ezetimibe has a dose-sparing advantage in patients intolerant of higher dose statins, although outcome evidence to support its use is awaited.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^113BK1pT]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111onMi6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations — patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

### Management of cardiovascular risk: the importance of meeting lipid targets [^111wNdmE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^114ge5vY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Emerging therapeutic strategies for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome [^115UMF5W]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in significantly reducing cardiovascular events has been established in many at-risk populations. However, patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS) pose a challenge for clinical management. A high degree of residual risk exists in patients with the MS or diabetes mellitus, and this is of growing importance because of the increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities in the world. As the MS has emerged as a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and diabetes, targeting treatment to achieve aggressive goals becomes paramount. This article reviews emerging therapeutic strategies for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with the MS.

Evidence for the Underuse of Lipid‐Lowering Therapies in Clinical Practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of > 600 000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of ≈1.5 million patients with a history of ≥ 1 major ASCVD event reported that > 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment intensification. Recently, an interim report of the European SANTORINI (Treatment of High and Very High Risk Dyslipidemic Patients for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Europe: A Multinational Observational Study) to assess the management of high‐risk and very high‐risk patients after publication of the ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines showed that combination therapy was used in just 27.3% of patients, of whom 17.1% received statin plus ezetimibe, and 4.1% received an anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibody plus oral lipid‐lowering therapy.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability.

### Unmet need for adjunctive Dyslipidemia Therapy in hypertriglyceridemia management [^115X4MUZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the important role of high-intensity statins in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in secondary and primary prevention, substantial residual risk persists, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Considerable attention is currently directed to the role that elevated triglycerides (TGs) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels play as important mediators of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, which is further strongly supported by genetic linkage studies. Previous trials with fibrates, niacin, and most cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors that targeted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol raising, and/or TG lowering, have failed to show conclusive evidence of incremental event reduction after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were "optimally controlled" with statins. Although omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in lowering TG levels and may have pleiotropic effects such as reducing plaque instability and proinflammatory mediators of atherogenesis, clinical outcomes data are currently lacking. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials of TG-lowering strategies with an optimal dosage of omega-3 fatty acids are nearing completion.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^1178PAur]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112UD3pm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

### How do we achieve optimal cardiovascular risk reduction? [^115PGbQB]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Optimizing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction requires the application of clinical evidence to patient care, as well as the refinement of risk assessment. Clinical evidence indicates that most patients are not treated to optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. Despite the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the incidence of CHD, many treated patients still experience CHD events. Targeting other lipid factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides may augment the risk reduction achieved by lowering LDL cholesterol. Refined global risk assessment can lead to more accurate determinations of absolute risk and to the identification both of high-risk patients needing aggressive intervention and intermediate-risk patients who appear to be at low risk. Previous global risk assessment measures failed to identify a substantial proportion of primary prevention patients who would benefit from therapy. However, revised guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program introduce new criteria for more precise risk assessment and advocate use of the Framingham scoring system to calculate absolute risk. Although intensified treatment is recommended for high-risk patients, cost considerations may limit drug therapy for some lower-risk individuals.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — primary prevention PCSK9 inhibitors states: For primary prevention, we recommend against offering PCSK9 inhibitors due to unknown long-term safety, inconclusive evidence for benefit, and high cost (Strong against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence cited includes a systematic review including 10,225 primary prevention patients that failed to demonstrate significant improvements in CV events or mortality, and none of the studies were designed to measure CV outcomes. Safety data are limited, with short-term adverse effects reported but side effects beyond three years unknown; the most common adverse event is injection site reactions, which occur at a higher rate compared to placebo, and one study demonstrated a significant increase in adverse events, mainly myalgia and influenza, with PCSK9 inhibitors compared to placebo; the PCSK9 literature is limited to safety outcomes of up to three years. Cost concerns are substantial: PCSK9 inhibitors are extremely expensive and of questionable cost-effectiveness, and a systematic review found they did not meet a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per additional quality-adjusted life year.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology on the management of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease algorithm-2020 executive summary [^111g27S2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^111CDvVj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

Atherogenic cholesterol lowering — statin therapy and risk factor management emphasizes that moderate- and high-intensity statins are reasonable for most patients, while in hypercholesterolemic patients who are statin intolerant, alternate atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drugs or alternative statin dosing regimens may need to be considered; nonlipid atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus, and therapies to lower cholesterol will reduce ASCVD risk even in the presence of other risk factors, with identified risk factors requiring management to maximize ASCVD risk reduction.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^115x5uqj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — definition and risk-based management states that dyslipidemia has traditionally been defined as one or more of the following: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL, or triglycerides (TGs) ≥ 200 mg/dL; in patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) or elevated risk for CVD, even "normal" lipids levels warrant intervention for CVD risk reduction. Treatment of dyslipidemia involves lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering drugs, and management has shifted toward managing dyslipidemia in the context of overall risk for CVD; much of the evidence is based on CV risk reduction and does not require lipid levels for inclusion criteria. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) addresses treatment and management strategies focusing upon an individual's risk factors and event history among patients at risk for CVD morbidity and mortality.

### Contemporary management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients: targets still not MET [^112fw2H1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our objective was to evaluate treatment patterns and the attainment of current National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-recommended lipid targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients.

Methods

Between December 2001 and December 2004, the prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines Oriented Approach to Lipid Lowering Registries recruited 8056 outpatients with diabetes, established cardiovascular disease (CVD), or both, who had a complete lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, defined as the achievement of LDL-cholesterol < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) according to NCEP guidelines. We examined patient characteristics and use of lipid-modifying therapy in relation to treatment outcome, which included the recently proposed optional LDL-cholesterol target (< 1.8 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) for very high-risk patients.

Results

Overall, 78.2% of patients were treated with a statin and 51.2% had achieved the recommended LDL-cholesterol target. Treatment success rate was highest in diabetic patients with CVD (59.6%), followed by nondiabetic patients with CVD (51.8%), and lowest (44.8%) in diabetic patients without CVD (P < .0001). Compared with untreated patients, those on statins were more likely to achieve target (34.4% vs 55.9%, P < .0001). Of the patients who failed to meet target, only 9.9% were taking high-dose statin, while 29.3% were not prescribed any statin therapy. Among very high-risk patients, 20.8% attained the optional LDL-cholesterol goal. In multivariable analysis, advanced age, male sex, diabetes, coronary artery disease, coronary revascularization, and use of statin were associated with treatment success (all P < .0001).

Conclusion

Despite the well-established benefits of available lipid-modifying drugs, current management of dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal, with a substantial proportion of patients failing to achieve guideline-recommended lipid targets. There remains an important opportunity to improve the quality of care for these high-risk patients.

Treatment intensity instead of lipid targets — The Work Group carefully considered whether to use target levels for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but noted that the evidence relating patient-oriented outcomes to LDL-C levels consisted of trial comparisons between therapy intensities.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

### Optimal management of lipids in diabetes and metabolic syndrome [^112S8hz4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome frequently have higher triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and more particles containing apolipoprotein B (ApoB); this combination contributes significantly to their cardiovascular risk. Optimal management of dyslipidemia and increased atherosclerotic risk requires a fundamental understanding of diabetic dyslipidemia, the clinical evidence for different interventional strategies, and the potential benefit of achieving therapeutic targets. For this review, we considered guidelines, recent reviews, and clinical trial results. The features of dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are linked metabolically and are related to central adiposity and insulin resistance. Levels of ApoB and HDL cholesterol are particularly important markers of risk. Guidelines broadly agree that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol should be reduced below population average levels. Additional or secondary strategies in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome are to decrease non-HDL cholesterol, ApoB and/or LDL particle concentration, to increase HDL cholesterol, and to reduce triglycerides. Lifestyle changes and statins are the bedrock of treatment, although second-line treatment using fibrates or niacin will likely benefit many patients with residual risk. Ezetimibe, too, has a favorable effect on lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers of risk. Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome has a distinct profile, suggesting the need for a tailored therapy that targets the key features of lowered HDL cholesterol and raised triglycerides, in addition to the primary antiatherogenic strategy of lowering ApoB-containing lipoproteins, such as LDL. With the prominent failure of some recent intervention trials, new therapeutic strategies-particularly safe and effective means to raise HDL-are needed to manage dyslipidemia in this high-risk population.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Combination drug therapy in dyslipidemia management — Therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent may be considered for patients who have not reached their treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with very high or high risk, and the maximum tolerated statin dosage should generally be used before add-on therapy is considered. Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^116RRBuT]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and provide updated and new recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These recommendations are intended for use by clinicians, health care team members, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Methods

This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary task force of content experts and guideline methodologists based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or cohort studies from database inception to November 7, 2023. An updated literature search was completed for any additional articles published by May 31, 2024. Clinical questions addressing nonstatin medications and patient-important outcomes were prioritized. The task force assessed the certainty of the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. All recommendations were based on the consideration of the certainty of the evidence across patient-important outcomes, in addition to issues of feasibility, acceptability, equity, and patient preferences and values.

Results

This guideline update includes 13 evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia focused on patient-important outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The task force issued a good practice statement to assess the risk of ASCVD events for primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia. The task force suggested the use of alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for adults who have ASCVD or who are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to standard care. The task force suggested against the use of these medications in adults without ASCVD. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the addition of inclisiran. For adults with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD, the task force suggested the use of eicosapentaenoic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid and strongly recommended against the use of niacin. There was insufficient evidence for recommendations regarding pharmacologic management in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). The task force suggested a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal of < 70 mg/dL in adults with dyslipidemia and ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD.

Conclusions

Pharmacotherapy is recommended in adults with dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of ASCVD events. There are several effective and safe treatment options for adults with dyslipidemia who have ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD who need additional lipid-lowering medications. Shared decision-making discussions are essential to determine the best option for each individual.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114mRFdm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association patient-centered dyslipidemia management emphasizes that an elevated level of atherogenic cholesterol is a root cause of atherosclerosis and that reducing elevated levels will lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; when lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality, and non-lipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed. Care should follow a patient-centered approach in which the initial step is a determination of the patient's risk for an ASCVD event and the patient should be an active participant in shared decision making. Lifestyle counseling is a key element, and if lifestyle therapies are insufficient to achieve desired atherogenic cholesterol levels, evidence-based drug therapy, particularly moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered; if goal levels are not achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, combining a statin with a second (and sometimes a third) agent may be considered for selected patients. Alternative strategies may be needed for patients who are statin intolerant or who prefer not to use statin therapy, and regular patient and lipid follow-up is warranted; treatment goals and periodic monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels are important tools. The scope of these recommendations also includes lifestyle therapies, groups with special considerations (children and adolescents, women, older patients, certain ethnic and racial groups, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with residual risk despite statin and lifestyle therapies), and strategies to improve patient outcomes by increasing adherence and using team-based collaborative care.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management — if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Dyslipidemia is defined by risk for cardiovascular disease — cardiovascular disease (CVD) is described as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally, with most CVD caused by atherosclerosis that builds plaque in arterial walls, narrowing the lumen and increasing the risk of chronic and acute ischemia; if a plaque ruptures, a blood clot may obstruct oxygenated blood flow to the heart or brain, resulting in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, with potentially irreversible tissue damage; control and reduction of CVD risk factors, including high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, elevated blood glucose levels, smoking, poor dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle, can contribute to a reduction in CVD morbidity and mortality, and for the purposes of this guideline, CVD includes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^112Sbrqw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. From the AFP Editors Cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis causes significant morbidity and mortality, which can be improved by controlling risk factors through lifestyle interventions and lipid-lowering medications. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense have updated recommendations for evaluation and management of dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied.

Diet One diet has clinical evidence of decreasing risk in primary and secondary prevention. A dietitian-led Mediterranean diet decreases rates of cardiovascular events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been studied extensively but does not reduce cardiovascular risk. Fiber, ginger, green tea, garlic, and red yeast rice have been suggested for dyslipidemia, but evidence is insufficient for recommendation. Physical Activity Physical activity is proven to reduce cardiovascular events. The greatest benefit occurs in sedentary people who pursue limited aerobic physical activity, so no specific target duration is specified. In the eight weeks following a cardiovascular event or revascularization, structured cardiac rehabilitation has a number needed to treat of 31 to prevent death and myocardial infarction over 10 years.

Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke. All persons with dyslipidemia should be advised to focus on lifestyle interventions, including regular aerobic exercise, a healthy diet, maintenance of a healthy weight, and abstinence from smoking. In addition to lifestyle interventions, lipid-lowering therapy should be considered for persons at moderate to high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease based on validated risk equations. Statin therapy is the first-line medical treatment for dyslipidemia due to its effectiveness and favorable adverse effect profile, but newer treatments provide additional tools for clinicians to effectively treat dyslipidemia.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^114ZfXdR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individualized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking) or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with 10‐year cardiovascular risk estimates. 1, 2, 3, 4 These guidelines have lowered the estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk threshold to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10‐year fatal cardiovascular risk chart and in those with low (< 5%) risk and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 2.6 and 4 mmol/L. 4 US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75 years with 10‐year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with different levels of evidence. 1, 2 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treatment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk. 3 The definition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These recommendations are based on the results from previous meta‐analyses 5, 6 and recent clinical trials, 7 which show that the efficacy of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk populations.

These threshold recommendations are controversial for several reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative rather than absolute risk reduction. 8, 9, 10 Finally, the randomization of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.

As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general population because specific groups (statin‐intolerant or poorly adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded, 11 data from electronic medical records can be used to provide population‐based evidence for cardiovascular risk management decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real‐life clinical conditions. 12

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk estimation.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

### Primary prevention of CVD: treating dyslipidemia… [^115vpPxc]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia, defined as elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. The incidence of dyslipidemia is high: In 2000, approximately 25 percent of adults in the United States had total cholesterol greater than 239. 4 mg per dL or were taking lipid-lowering medication. There is a continuous, graded relationship between the total plasma cholesterol concentration and ischemic heart disease morbidity and mortality. Ischemic heart disease is the leading single cause of death in high-income countries and the second in low- and middle-income countries.

Primary prevention in this context is defined as long-term management of persons at increased risk, but who have no clinically overt evidence of cardiovascular disease, such as myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, and who have not undergone revascularization. Definition Dyslipidemia, defined as elevated total or LDL cholesterol levels, or low levels of HDL cholesterol, is an important risk factor for CHD and stroke. This review examines the evidence for treatment of dyslipidemia for primary prevention of CHD. Primary prevention in this context is defined as long-term management of persons at increased risk, but who have no clinically overt evidence of CVD, such as acute MI, angina, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, and who have not undergone revascularization. Incidence and Prevalence Dyslipidemia is common. Data from the U. S.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1999 to 2000 found that 25 percent of adults had total cholesterol greater than 239. 4 mg per dL or were taking a lipid-lowering medication. According to the World Health Report 1999, ischemic heart disease was the leading single cause of death in the world, the leading single cause of death in high-income countries, and second only to lower respiratory tract infections in low- and middle-income countries. In 1998, it was the leading cause of death, with nearly 7. 4 million estimated deaths per year in member states of the World Health Organization, and caused the eighth highest burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^112oADnC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

AACE dyslipidemia guideline — population scope and definitions: The guideline recommendations apply to adults 18 years of age and older who have dyslipidemia or hypertriglyceridemia and who are receiving standard of care treatment but who are not at goal and may consider additional medications. The majority of trials informing the GRADE evidence profiles included adults with ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD, and for this guideline, the task force considered ASCVD risk to include individuals with known risk factors based on clinical judgment or validated risk assessment tool. Dyslipidemia was defined as LDL-C levels greater than 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) in the general population and greater than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in individuals with ASCVD. Hypertriglyceridemia was defined as triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) and severe hypertriglyceridemia was defined as triglycerides 500 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) or above.

### Treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular outcomes: the journey so far – is this the end for statins? [^111zDBYV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is common and is associated with the highest population-attributable risk for cardiovascular disease. Of various cardiovascular preventive therapies, the evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting the importance of aggressive lipid lowering is the most robust, particularly for statins. Despite the use of proven therapies, cardiovascular disease event rates remain relatively high, underpinning the development of novel therapies. In addition to testing new drugs to reduce low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, there has been a major focus on treatments that can favorably influence high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This review provides an overview of the important relationship between lipids and cardiovascular disease, the lipid-modifying therapeutic approaches to reducing cardiovascular disease, new guidelines and recommendations, and the challenges ahead for the treatment of dyslipidemia, particularly whether statins will remain at the forefront of recommended therapies.

### An international atherosclerosis society position paper: global recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia – full report [^113nJg4m]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

An international panel of the International Atherosclerosis Society has developed a new set of recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia. The panel identifies non — high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as the major atherogenic lipoprotein. Primary and secondary prevention are considered separately. Optimal levels for atherogenic lipoproteins are derived for the two forms of prevention. For primary prevention, the recommendations emphasize lifestyle therapies to reduce atherogenic lipoproteins; drug therapy is reserved for subjects at greater risk. Risk assessment is based on estimation of lifetime risk according to differences in baseline population risk in different nations or regions. Secondary prevention emphasizes use of cholesterol-lowering drugs to attain optimal levels of atherogenic lipoproteins.

### Lipid disorders: justification of methods and goals of treatment [^1131nWts]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). While some uncertainty exists about the clinical significance of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, large primary- and secondary-prevention studies aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins have convincingly reduced CHD events and total mortality. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment. This failure to achieve clinical treatment goals may be due to poor physician adherence to treatment guidelines, patient noncompliance, and the presence of concomitant medical conditions that modify typical hyperlipidemia management. This review considers the challenges and available strategies to optimize lipid management in patients at risk for CHD.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^117XuUuN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111XpJM9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia management — older patients (Chart 6) states that primary prevention strategies in patients 65–79 years of age should be managed in accordance with the NLA Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia-Part 1, and that for patients age ≥ 65 to < 80 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, moderate or high intensity statin therapy should be considered after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. For secondary prevention in patients ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon a provider-patient discussion of the risks and benefits of such therapy, consideration of drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations, and patient preference. Risk calculators such as the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk calculator or the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator can be used in select older individuals with one additional risk factor to further assess risk, using the thresholds for high risk of ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham risk calculator; however, these risk calculators have several limitations for use in older patients and may result in overestimation of lower risk older individuals. Older, primary prevention patients who are statin-eligible should undergo a patient-centered discussion with their provider about the risks and benefits of statin therapy, and if unable to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification, the provider should discuss the pros and cons of drug therapy and, if feasible, prescribe moderate intensity statin therapy, particularly when risk exceeds the high risk threshold. CAC scoring may be useful to further assess risk in older patients for whom questions remain about whether to prescribe drug therapy. If statin intolerance is an issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens or low dose statin combination therapy or non-statin monotherapy, with a goal of at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^114mHAPQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patient-centered dyslipidemia management — NLA Expert Panel framework emphasizes that recommendations support, not replace, clinical judgment and highlight patient participation and the evidence base. "Clinical recommendations aim to assist clinicians in making decisions about the best strategies for management of a condition, taking into account potential benefits and risks of the available options". The recommendations are "intended to inform, not replace, clinical judgment", and "A patient-centered approach dictates that clinical judgment take into account the circumstances, objectives, and preferences of each individual patient". "The patient should be an active participant in the process… including potential risks and side effects, as well as benefits and costs", and "Patient-provider collaboration in treatment decisions tends to improve long-term adherence". The panel's consensus is that accumulated evidence "warrants a modest refinement of previous lipid-related risk management strategies", and the evidence base "emphasized results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate lipid-altering interventions on clinical ASCVD events (mainly myocardial infarction, coronary death, and stroke), including subgroup assessments and pooled analyses", while acknowledging that many questions remain and RCT evidence "may have uncertain relevance to particular patients" due to highly selected trial populations.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^112DEs4V]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111H9u15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia risk rationale — In randomized controlled trials, each reduction of 1% in LDL-C or non-HDL-C is associated with a 1% reduction in coronary heart disease event risk over a period of ~5 years, and genetic variants generally show that each 1% difference in LDL-C is associated with a 2–3% difference in CHD risk; results from intervention studies lasting only ~ 5 years likely underestimate the potential benefit of decades-long exposure to lower levels of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol. In the Copenhagen Heart Studies, each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in LDL-C was associated with a 47% difference in CHD event risk, whereas each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in VLDL-C was associated with a CHD risk difference of 182%, supporting the importance of both LDL-C and non-HDL-C as targets of therapy.

Visit 3 — follow-up and potential initiation: If goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol have been attained, responses to therapy should be monitored at intervals of 6 to 12 months. Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy should be considered for very high-risk patients irrespective of atherogenic cholesterol levels, and if goal levels have not been attained and the patient's levels remain above the threshold for consideration of drug therapy, drug treatment might be initiated.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Managing dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^115CgYx7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD > 20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels > 130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to < 100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.

### Trials in "True" dyslipidemic patients are urged to reconsider comprehensive lipid management as a means to reduce residual cardiovascular risk [^113XzRaG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Who should promote and perform pragmatic cardiovascular outcome lipid trials?

The purpose of healthcare stakeholders of evolving toward personalized evidence‐based medicine calls for pragmatism in future lipid trials, in order to inform physicians and patients about the real cost‐effectiveness of a treatment in certain candidates for the treatment. The design of some new studies suggests that things are hopefully starting to move in this direction.

REDUCE‐IT 60 was aimed to evaluate the efficacy in reducing residual cardiovascular risk of a 4 g daily dose of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk on LDL‐C–lowering drugs with fairly well‐controlled LDL‐C levels (median 74 mg/dL) and baseline fasting TG levels between 150 and 500 mg/dL (median 216 mg/dL). Even though the effect of the therapy on TG levels was mild (18.3%; −39.0 mg per deciliter), the treatment produced, after 5 years, a 25% reduction of the primary cardiovascular end point. To what extent these effects are the result of TG lowering is not clear, as omega‐3 have many other putative cardioprotective pleiotropic effects. Yet, the trial pragmatically tested a coherent hypothesis in candidates suitable for the intervention in the real‐world clinical practice, responding to a frequent question of physicians: can we reduce residual risk in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia through omega‐3 fatty acids?

Propitiously, STRENGTH, 61 another pragmatic randomized placebo‐controlled trial with omega‐3 fatty acids in statin‐treated patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events, with well‐controlled LDL‐C, hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 180 to < 500 mg/dL), and low levels of HDL‐C (< 42 mg/dL in men or < 47 mg/dL in women) is ongoing, and the results are awaited by the end of 2019.

Another example of a pragmatic TG‐lowering trial in high‐risk patients is the ongoing PROMINENT trial, 62 a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled cardiovascular outcome trial with the novel fibrate compound Pemafibrate. The PROMINENT trial plans to recruit high‐risk patients with diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease, and, for the first time in fibrate outcome trials, all the patients will have TGs > 200 mg/dL and low HDL‐C despite best evidence‐based treatment, including high‐intensity statin therapy. The results of the PROMINENT trial are awaited by 2022.

### Evidence for a combined approach to the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia [^114q7jQi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The recognition that hypertension and dyslipidemia coexist more often than would be expected by chance and that their combination increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has important implications for patient management. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and healthy individuals with multiple CVD risk factors — including concomitant dyslipidemia and hypertension-are the primary focus of updated treatment guidelines for CVD prevention. There is a need for a treatment paradigm shift from the diagnosis and treatment of individual CVD risk factors to the assessment and management of total CVD risk. Goals for each CVD risk factor need to be intensified when multiple sources of risk are present. Patients who have no overt disease but who have multiple CVD risk factors are now understood to be at high risk and should be the target of aggressive primary preventive strategies to avert unnecessary morbidity and mortality. It is also becoming clear that CVD risk factors interact at the level of the endothelium to promote atherosclerosis. Furthermore, recent clinical trials, including those assessing atherosclerotic progression and CVD endpoints, have demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions targeted at multiple risk factors for CVD.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116U8Lqy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.
