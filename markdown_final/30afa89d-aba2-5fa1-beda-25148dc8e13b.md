## Question

how often should a patient check blood glucose daily?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often a patient should check blood glucose daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, especially diabetes type and treatment regimen. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines (ADA, AACE, ISPAD) recommend for insulin-treated versus non-insulin-treated patients. Next, I will examine the evidence base for non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, including meta-analyses and structured SMBG. After that, I should consider special populations like pregnancy, pediatrics, and high-risk hypoglycemia. Finally, I will synthesize practical, individualized recommendations and note when CGM changes the calculus, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: there is no single "daily frequency" that fits all patients. Frequency depends on diabetes type, whether insulin is used, regimen intensity, hypoglycemia risk, A1C trajectory, and patient preferences, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to these axes before giving numbers [^c4ac52b2] [^d4ca7224].

> For insulin-treated diabetes, I should confirm the baseline standard. ADA 2025 advises that people on insulin check glucose when appropriate across the day — fasting, before meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, overnight as needed, before/during/after exercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected, and before critical tasks like driving — which in practice often translates to multiple checks per day, commonly 4–6 or more, with AACE recommending a minimum of twice daily and ideally before each insulin injection, and ISPAD advising 6–10 times/day in youth with type 1 diabetes to optimize glycemia and safety [^c4ac52b2] [^d4ca7224] [^31d686f1].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response signal. Observational and cohort data in type 1 diabetes show a linear relationship between more frequent SMBG and lower A1C, with differences on the order of about 1% A1C when moving from infrequent to 3–4 checks/day, and further gains with higher frequency, reinforcing the guideline stance that more frequent SMBG is associated with better control when patients act on the data [^2fed0da9] [^9c6388d4].

> For non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Historically, routine daily SMBG without a structured plan has not shown durable A1C benefit and may add burden; the Cochrane review found a small, early A1C reduction that attenuated by 12 months, and an IPD meta-analysis found only a modest 0.25% A1C reduction at 6 months without convincing clinical meaningfulness, so I should not recommend daily SMBG for all such patients [^8ab6e855] [^987fd163].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. More recent evidence suggests structured SMBG can help when embedded with education and therapy adjustment. A 2023 meta-analysis found that SMBG reduced A1C by about 0.3% versus no SMBG, with greater benefit around 8–11 times per week and when results were used to adjust lifestyle or medications, and the SMBG randomized trial with TeleCare support produced clinically significant A1C improvements, indicating that frequency plus actionable feedback is key [^1b7403fb] [^8e1b0722].

> I should double-check guideline nuance here. ADA 2025 supports BGM in non-insulin therapies when altering meal plans, activity, or medications, especially agents that can cause hypoglycemia, and AACE notes that patients not on insulin or secretagogues may not benefit from routine BGM, so any recommendation should be individualized and tied to a plan for using the data [^7e143b00] [^4bd416ef].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy with diabetes, frequent SMBG is standard — typically fasting, 1–2 hours postprandial, and bedtime — to safely achieve tight but individualized targets and reduce maternal-fetal complications, and this intensity is supported by obstetric guidance even though head-to-head monitoring strategies have not shown superiority [^6ad51a4f]. For children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, ISPAD recommends 6–10 SMBG checks per day or CGM, given the need to balance growth, activity, and hypoglycemia risk, with ADA similarly advising multiple daily checks for youth with T1D [^f0c579be] [^e08878d1].

> For high hypoglycemia risk or hypoglycemia unawareness, I should confirm that guidelines favor CGM over frequent fingersticks when available, while still ensuring access to SMBG for validation and during sensor gaps; this applies to type 1 diabetes on MDI and to selected type 2 patients at high risk, with endocrine society guidance emphasizing CGM-first strategies in these scenarios [^8cca9f56] [^7e495ac5].

> Next, I should review how CGM changes the equation. ADA 2025 recommends real-time CGM for insulin-treated patients as close to daily as possible, with scanning or viewing data frequently to avoid gaps, and to maintain backup SMBG access; this can reduce or replace many routine fingersticks while improving time-in-range and mitigating hypoglycemia, though patients still need SMBG for calibration, when symptoms don't match sensor values, or during warm-up [^7cfcea51] [^8cca9f56].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my bottom line is clinically precise. For insulin-treated diabetes, multiple daily checks — often 4–6 or more — aligned to meals, activity, and hypoglycemia risk are appropriate, with AACE advising at least twice daily and ideally before each injection, and ISPAD recommending 6–10/day in youth; for non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, routine daily SMBG is not advised unless it is structured, timed, and used to adjust therapy, in which case around 8–11 times per week can be reasonable during active management phases; for pregnancy with diabetes, frequent SMBG is standard; and for high hypoglycemia risk, prioritize CGM with SMBG backup rather than escalating fingerstick frequency alone [^2c916831] [^d4ca7224] [^f0c579be] [^1b7403fb] [^6ad51a4f] [^8cca9f56].

> Finally, I should confirm practical guardrails. Any SMBG plan must include education on technique, targets, and how to act on results, with periodic reassessment of frequency as therapy, A1C, and patient preferences evolve; without a plan to use the data, additional testing is unlikely to improve outcomes and may increase burden, so I need to ensure each patient knows why, when, and how to check, and what to do with the numbers [^2c916831] [^d4ca7224].

The frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be **individualized** based on diabetes type, treatment regimen, and glycemic control. For **insulin-treated patients**, check at least 2–4 times daily (before meals, at bedtime, and as needed for hypoglycemia) [^d4ca7224]; for **non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes**, routine daily SMBG is not generally recommended unless used for structured education or during therapy changes [^9717fb4d] [^7e143b00]. In pregnancy, monitor **4–7 times daily** (fasting, 1–2 hours postprandial, and bedtime) [^6ad51a4f]. For type 1 diabetes or high hypoglycemia risk, use CGM or frequent SMBG (up to 6–10 times/day) [^f0c579be] [^e08878d1]. Reassess frequency regularly and align with patient goals and A1C targets [^c4ac52b2].

---

## General principles for glucose monitoring frequency

- **Individualization**: Frequency should be tailored to diabetes type, treatment regimen, glycemic control, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^2c916831] [^d4ca7224].
- **Clinical goals**: Monitoring should support achieving A1C targets, reducing hypoglycemia, and guiding therapy adjustments [^44392c42].
- **Education**: Patients should be trained to use SMBG data to adjust diet, activity, and medication [^6eeb5e58].

---

## Specific recommendations by diabetes type and treatment

| **Diabetes type and treatment** | **Recommended frequency of glucose monitoring** |
|-|-|
| Type 1 diabetes (insulin-treated) | - Multiple daily checks (6–10/day) [^f0c579be] <br/> - Before meals, snacks, bedtime, and as needed for hypoglycemia [^e08878d1] |
| Type 2 diabetes (insulin-treated) | - At least 2–4 times daily [^d4ca7224] <br/> - Before meals, at bedtime, and as needed for hypoglycemia [^2c916831] |
| Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-treated) | - Routine daily SMBG not generally recommended [^9717fb4d] <br/> - Consider structured SMBG for education or therapy changes [^7e143b00] |
| Gestational diabetes | - 4–7 times daily [^notfound] <br/> - Fasting, 1–2 hours postprandial, and bedtime [^6ad51a4f] |
| High hypoglycemia risk or hypoglycemia unawareness | - Frequent SMBG or CGM [^8cca9f56] <br/> - Up to 6–10 times/day [^f0c579be] |

---

## Evidence supporting monitoring frequency

- **Insulin-treated diabetes**: Frequent SMBG is associated with improved A1C and reduced hypoglycemia [^2fed0da9] [^dc0f1276].
- **Non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes**: Routine SMBG without structured use does not consistently improve outcomes [^8ab6e855] [^987fd163].
- **Structured SMBG**: Paired pre/postprandial testing with education can improve A1C in non-insulin-treated patients [^1b7403fb] [^8e1b0722].

---

## Factors influencing monitoring frequency

- **Glycemic control**: Poor control may require more frequent monitoring [^d4ca7224].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Higher risk warrants more frequent checks [^556027a2].
- **Patient preferences**: Adherence and comfort with monitoring should guide frequency [^fe9fc427].
- **Comorbidities**: CKD, pregnancy, or other conditions may necessitate adjusted frequency [^062078e1] [^6ad51a4f].

---

## Role of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)

CGM is recommended for **type 1 diabetes**, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, and high hypoglycemia risk, providing real-time data and reducing hypoglycemia [^7cfcea51] [^8cca9f56]. It complements or replaces SMBG, but patients should retain access to fingerstick testing for validation and when CGM is unavailable [^0079c532].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Cost and access**: Insurance coverage and affordability can limit frequency [^5ee1711a].
- **Patient education**: Training on technique and data interpretation is essential [^9f1b3594].
- **Technology integration**: CGM and digital tools can enhance monitoring efficiency [^5781fc29].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Insulin-treated patients**: Monitor multiple times daily (2–10/day) based on regimen and hypoglycemia risk [^d4ca7224] [^f0c579be].
- **Non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes**: Avoid routine daily SMBG; use structured SMBG for education or therapy changes [^9717fb4d] [^7e143b00].
- **Pregnancy**: Monitor 4–7 times daily to achieve tight glycemic targets [^6ad51a4f].
- **High hypoglycemia risk**: Use CGM or frequent SMBG (6–10/day) [^8cca9f56] [^f0c579be].

---

The frequency of glucose monitoring should be **individualized** to balance glycemic targets, hypoglycemia risk, and patient capacity, with structured use and education to maximize benefit [^2c916831] [^d4ca7224].

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose: practical aspects [^4aa88f00]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be part of a regular management plan for patients with diabetes. Self-monitoring of blood glucose provides information regarding an individual's dynamic blood glucose profile. This information can help with the appropriate scheduling of food, activity, and medication. It is also required for understanding of the timing of blood glucose variations. Lack of regular SMBG predicts hospitalization for diabetes-related complications. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential tool for people with diabetes who are taking insulin or for those who experience fluctuations in their blood glucose levels, especially hypoglycemia. Application of practical aspects that aid in easy management of SMBG makes the task of checking blood glucose more achievable. For patients taking insulin and adjusting their dose, SMBG is needed for self-management. For others receiving oral medication, profiling glucose trends and the confirmation of high or low blood glucose can be a useful addendum to successful management.

### Monitoring glycemic control: the importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^567e7cb7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control. However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

### The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in the care of people with diabetes: report of a global consensus conference [^46753a18]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an underutilized but integral part of disease management for patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Guidelines on the recommended frequency and timing of SMBG vary among international diabetes associations, and patients are often unaware of actions they should take in response to SMBG. results. In response to this, a global consensus conference of recognized diabetes experts convened to clarify the role of SMBG as a tool to help optimize glycemic control (e.g., complementing information provided by hemoglobin A1c, detecting postprandial excursions, identifying glucose patterns, and providing patients feedback on lifestyle and medications) while minimizing hypoglycemia and maintaining quality of life. The consensus panel also sought to reinforce the importance of appropriate and systematic patient and provider response to the collected SMBG data. A set of 16 consensus statements was approved by the panel. This article presents the 16 statements together with some brief rationale for their inclusion.

### International diabetes federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: a review of recommendations [^12692217]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Question 4: What are the targets for postmeal glycaemic control and how should they be assessed?

A 2-h postmeal goal of < 7.8 mmol/l (< 140 mg/dl) is recommended, in line with targets published in guidelines from other associations. Such guidelines define normal glucose tolerance (NGT) as post-challenge values of < 7.8 mmol/l 2 h after ingestion of a 75-g glucose load, corresponding to postmeal values of healthy individuals after meals. The 2-h time frame for testing is also in agreement with published guidelines and in addition reflects the 2- to 3-h return of postmeal hyperglycaemia to basal levels in individuals with normal glucose tolerance.

The guideline encourages performing glucose monitoring as frequently as needed in order to guide therapy to achieve PMG targets. In particular, the guideline suggests considering self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), as it is the only way to directly assess PMG. However, some degree of controversy surrounds SMBG use, particularly with respect to the frequency of monitoring in non-insulin requiring diabetes. Nevertheless, most professional diabetes organizations continue to advocate its use, generally recommending that self-monitoring is performed at least three times daily in individuals treated with insulin and according to treatment regimen and level of glycaemic control in non-insulin dependent diabetes. What is more, the use of structured SMBG appears to result in a significant reduction in HbA 1c, even in individuals with non-insulin requiring diabetes. These findings support the implementation of SMBG as part of a structured programme that may involve the training of clinicians and patients to accurately interpret results and adjust therapy accordingly in a timely manner.

Glycaemic goals for clinical management of diabetes

HbA 1c < 6.5%
Premeal (fasting) < 5.5 mmol/l (< 100 mg/dl)
Two hours postmeal < 7.8 mmol/l (< 140 mg/dl)

Note: Lower glucose parameters to as near normal as safely possible. Glycaemic targets should be individualized. These goals are not appropriate for children and pregnant women.

Recommendations

Two-hour postmeal plasma glucose should not exceed 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) as long as hypoglycaemia is avoided.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose should be considered because it is currently the most practical method for monitoring postmeal glycaemia.
Efficacy of treatment regimens should be monitored as frequently as needed to guide therapy towards achieving postmeal plasma glucose target.

Optimizing blood glucose monitoring (BGM) device use emphasizes that optimal use of BGM devices requires proper review and interpretation of data by both the person with diabetes and the health care professional to ensure that data are used in an effective and timely manner; in people with type 1 diabetes, there is a correlation between greater frequency of checking and lower A1C levels, yet among those who check their blood glucose at least once daily, many report taking no action when results are high or low; the ongoing need for frequency of BGM should be reevaluated at frequent intervals to ensure its effectiveness.

### Current evidence regarding the value of self-monitored blood glucose testing [^92be2bab]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many people with diabetes are falling short of attaining or maintaining glycemic goals. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is among the many strategies proposed to address the problem. SMBG complements hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing by providing specific information regarding the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on glycemia. Although the importance of self-monitoring is appreciated for insulin-using patients, evidence is still emerging in support of self-monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes managed with oral agents or diet. Evaluating the available evidence requires a good understanding of the study design and methodology. Although several clinical trials involving SMBG have been insufficiently powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in HbA1c, recent meta-analyses have reproducibly supported the benefit of self-monitoring in non-insulin-treated patients. Although additional work is needed to establish optimal frequency and timing of SMBG, these studies can serve as a basis for conservative recommendations to guide patients and their healthcare providers.

### Hypoglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: it can happen [^5ee1711a]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypoglycemia detection

Patient monitoring

Blood glucose monitoring

Home blood glucose monitoring is facilitated by easy-to-use portable devices. Some individuals with T2D test often, while some never test. The number and timing of prescribed glucose tests per day should be individualized to the needs of each person with diabetes. However, payers often restrict glucose monitor models and/or strip allowance and frequently change coverage yearly. Finally, out-of-pocket cost and the pain of the finger sticks also limit testing.

No consistency is found in the literature for the recommended number of blood glucose tests per day for people with T2D on insulin. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care acknowledge the importance of blood glucose testing for those with T2D and recommends an individualized approach to the frequency of testing. Rama Chandran et al found that four to five blood glucose tests per day was enough to predict hypoglycemia comparable to CGM. Although often resisted by people with diabetes, prediction and prevention of hypoglycemia is an excellent reason to suggest multiple daily blood glucose testing for people with T2D treated with insulin. A large observational study of patients in Italy found that 26.4% of participants tested blood glucose less than once a day and the incidence of hypoglycemia was inversely correlated with the number of daily blood glucose tests performed. In addition to scheduled blood glucose tests, blood glucose also should be tested when low glucose is suspected, either before or during treatment, and retested every 15 min after treatment until resolution.

In the clinical setting, people with diabetes are encouraged to bring their glucose monitors with them for data download. Some individuals bring their monitors, while others leave them at home. Some people with diabetes do not know how to interpret their glucose levels or how to improve their control. Digital data reports or paper logbook review at each visit allows for conversations between the person with diabetes and the healthcare team about glucose patterns (including hypoglycemic episodes), areas of success and areas of needed improvement.

If a person with diabetes receives limited to no feedback from the HCP about glucose levels, some will not consistently test. Inattention by the HCP to the glucose data reports can lead to lower individual motivation to test, record or report.

### Which patients should be evaluated for blood glucose variability? [^6ed9fe27]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is characterized by glycaemic disorders that include both sustained chronic hyperglycaemia and acute fluctuations (i.e.g.lycaemic variability). Increasing attention is being paid to the role of glycaemic variability as a relevant determinant for diabetes control and prevention of its vascular complications. As a consequence, it is strongly suggested that a global antidiabetic strategy should be aimed at reducing to a minimum the different components of glycaemic control (i.e. HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, as well as glycaemic variability). Subjects at risk of hypoglycaemia, subjects with postprandial hyperglycaemia and patients who need to adjust or start insulin seem to be the categories that require glycaemic variability monitoring. The analysis of blood glucose variability represents an additional tool in the global assessment of glycaemic control and can serve as a guide to the clinician in the management of therapy and for the patients both in the prevention of acute complications, in particular hypoglycaemia, and chronic disease, in particular macrovascular complications.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose as part of the integral care of type 2 diabetes [^5b295bbe]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

There are no definitive clinical studies to answer which is the optimal frequency of SMBG for non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients; still, substantial disparity exists among the recommendations on the frequency and timing of SMBG among international diabetes associations.

A group of experts from the U.K. reached a consensus opinion suggesting patients using oral antidiabetic drugs to monitor their blood glucose at least once daily, varying the time of testing between fasting, preprandial, and postprandial levels during the day. A global consensus conference on SMBG differentiated its recommendations based on the treatment and the metabolic status of the patients; accordingly, it was recommended that patients on intensified insulin therapy or insulin pump have more than three to four readings per day. The panel recommended that patients on oral antidiabetic agents or daily insulin who are above glycemic target perform SMBG more than twice per day and those at target perform SMBG more than once per day and collect pre- and postmeal glucose test results over the week. The panel recommended that individuals with diabetes treated with a combination of oral antidiabetic agents plus insulin perform more frequent profiles of pre- and postprandial glucose per week and suggested that patients with type 2 diabetes not receiving pharmacological therapy perform more than one profile per week. In the most recent clinical practice recommendations, the American Diabetes Association recognizes SMBG as an important element in adjusting or adding new interventions and, in particular, in titrating insulin doses. But it is stated that for patients on hypoglycemic regimens that do not include sulfonylureas or glinides (these patients are therefore not likely to suffer hypoglycemia), SMBG usually is not required. However, it is stated that SMBG may be used to determine whether therapeutic blood glucose targets are being achieved and to adjust treatment regimens without requiring the patient to have laboratory-based blood glucose testing. No specific recommendations with respect to frequency are provided.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes [^88d020f2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

A key aim of management in people with diabetes mellitus is to control blood glucose concentrations, in order to avoid the complications of persistently raised levels (with their attendant healthcare costs) and improve quality of life. However, such control is associated with an increased likelihood of hypoglycaemia, particularly among patients on insulin therapy. In pursuit of good glycaemic control while avoiding hypoglycaemia, self-monitoring of blood glucose is widely acknowledged as a routine part of management in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the cost of monitoring products has now become a major issue for healthcare providers. This has led to some restrictions being placed on self-monitoring, especially for patients with type 2 diabetes, where the evidence for a benefit is less clear-cut. With this in mind, we review the data relating to the benefits of self-monitoring in adults with diabetes, particularly those with type 2 disease.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose: one STeP forward? [^d16c46be]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In times of short health care budgets, reimbursement for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in diabetes patients without insulin treatment is subject to debate. The Structured Testing Program (STeP) trial found a positive correlation of test frequency and improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients not treated with insulin.

Methods

A structured literature search for other clinical studies reporting on SMBG frequency was performed.

Results

There is scarce evidence: three trials, including STeP, noted a significant and relevant correlation between testing frequency and improved HbA1c levels (FA effect), whereas two studies did not. The comparability between the identified studies is problematic.

Conclusion

Future research should consider correlations between testing frequency and level of glycemic control. More emphasis should be placed on a structured approach to use SMBG and to address adherence to testing and therapy.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in insulin-treated diabetes: a multicase study [^15a36e58]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines recommend regular individualized self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as a tool for self-management in type 1 diabetes mellitus (four times daily)and in people with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin. Despite growing evidence on the importance of SMBG as a key component of self-management, many people who are recommended to test routinely are not testing as frequently as recommended, and many are not testing at all. There is also wide variation in individual practice of SMBG: frequency, timing, the measurement itself, interpretation of readings, resulting actions taken, and evaluation of the outcome. These wide variations in practice may account for why clinical benefits identified from experimental studies that require SMBG to be undertaken according to strict protocols are often not replicated in observational studies. For this reason, it is important that individual self-management in diabetes is studied in a real-world context. We have conducted a multicase study among insulin-treated people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Scotland to explore in depth how and why they carry out SMBG within the context of their daily lives.

### Role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in glycemic control [^4999ddb4]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the role of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the management of diabetes mellitus.

Methods

Current trends and published evidence are reviewed.

Results

Despite the widespread evidence that lowering glycemic levels reduces the risks of complications in patients with diabetes, little improvement in glycemic control has been noted among patients in the United States and Europe in recent years. Although SMBG has been widely used, considerable controversy surrounds its role in achieving glycemic control. The high cost of test strips has made considerations regarding appropriate recommendations for SMBG a priority, especially in light of the current climate of health-care cost-containment. Existing clinical recommendations lack specific guidance to patients and clinicians regarding SMBG practice intensity and frequency, particularly for those patients not treated with insulin. Previous studies of the association between SMBG and glycemic control often found weak and conflicting results.

Conclusion

A reexamination of the role of SMBG is needed, with special attention to the unique needs of patients using different diabetes treatments, within special clinical subpopulations, and during initiation of SMBG versus its ongoing use. Further understanding of the intensity and frequency of SMBG needed to reflect the variability in glycemic patterns would facilitate more specific guideline development. Educational programs that focus on teaching patients the recommended SMBG practice, specific glycemic targets, and appropriate responses to various blood glucose readings would be beneficial. Continuing medical education programs for health-care providers should suggest ways to analyze patient SMBG records to tailor medication regimens. For transfer or communication of SMBG reports to the clinical staff, a standardized format that extracts key data elements and allows quick review by health-care providers would be useful. Because the practice of SMBG is expensive, the cost-effectiveness of SMBG needs to be carefully assessed.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose during pregnancy: indications and limitations [^0a776007]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Perinatal morbidity and mortality rates, often affected by maternal diabetes, have dramatically been reduced since the discovery of insulin and its therapeutic implementation. In addition to increased availability of insulin, many important technological advances have been developed over the preceding decades. These advances culminated in a larger array of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities that contributed to improved outcomes in high-risk pregnancies.

The availability of glucose meters has represented an important positive impact in the treatment of pregnant women with any type of diabetes. Data frequently show patients who perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) more strictly adhere to treatment programs due to increased comprehension regarding treatment and participation in the prescribed treatment regimen.

Indications for self-monitoring of blood glucose during pregnancy complicated by diabetes

SMBG is an integral part of standard diabetes care. It allows pregnant women and their healthcare providers to determine the most effective therapeutic modality (e.g. diet, physical activity, or insulin) to control glucose levels and reduce risks of diabetes-related complications. The number of daily tests required to adequately monitor blood glucose levels is specific to the patient and based on the recommendation of the practitioner. Several characteristics, unique to each pregnant woman should be considered. For example, the type of treatment (diet and/or insulin), frequency and intensity of physical activity, and the risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, SMBG makes patients feel more secure and comfortable using insulin since it allows early recognition of symptoms of hypoglycemia.

The indications for, and frequency of SMBG in pregnant women that are not under insulin treatment must be tailored to the individual. Patients must be trained to adjust the amount of food intake with the frequency, intensity, and timing of physical exercise. It is unclear whether SMBG alone leads to improved glycemic control in non-insulin treated subjects with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, there is no data in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Measured glucose values need to be frequently checked to ensure both accuracy and the patient's understanding of any alterations to prescribed treatment. For the vast majority of patients using insulin, SMBG is recommended three or more times per day. A more intensive SMBG regimen is indicated for women with pre-gestational type 1 or 2 diabetes. The aim is to reach adequate HbA1c levels safely without inducing hypoglycemia.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2022 guideline — glucose monitoring frequency recommends that A1C should be measured at least semiannually in all persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) and at least quarterly in persons not at their glycemic target (Grade B; BEL 2). It further states that all persons who use insulin should use CGM or perform blood glucose monitoring (BGM) a minimum of twice daily and ideally before any insulin injection, with more frequent BGM needed for those taking multiple injections, not at A1C targets, or with a history of hypoglycemia; persons not requiring insulin or insulin secretagogues may often benefit from BGM.

People with diabetes using basal insulin and/or oral agents and noninsulin injectables — blood glucose monitoring (BGM) associations with A1C include that in almost 27,000 youth with type 1 diabetes, increased daily frequency of BGM was significantly associated with lower A1C levels (−0.2% per additional check per day) and with fewer acute complications. A trial of once-daily BGM with enhanced feedback found no clinically or statistically significant change in A1C levels at 1 year. Meta-analyses have suggested that BGM can reduce A1C levels by 0.25–0.3% at 6 months, but the effect was attenuated at 12 months in one analysis. Reductions in A1C levels were greater (−0.3%) in trials where structured BGM data were used to adjust medications, and a structured BGM group reduced their A1C levels by 0.3% more than the control group; however, A1C levels were not changed significantly without such structured diabetes therapy adjustment. Performing BGM alone does not lower blood glucose levels, and the information must be integrated into clinical and self-management treatment plans.

Glucose Monitoring

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be carried out three or more times daily for patients using multiple insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. (A)
For patients using less frequent insulin injections, noninsulin therapies, or medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and physical activity alone, SMBG may be useful as a guide to the success of therapy. (E)
To achieve postprandial glucose targets, postprandial SMBG may be appropriate. (E)
When prescribing SMBG, ensure that patients receive initial instruction in, and routine follow-up evaluation of, SMBG technique and their ability to use data to adjust therapy. (E)
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with intensive insulin regimens can be a useful tool to lower A1C in selected adults (aged ≥ 25 years) with type 1 diabetes (A).
Although evidence for A1C lowering is less strong in children, teens, and younger adults, CGM may be helpful in these groups. Success correlates with adherence to ongoing use of the device. (C)
CGM may be a supplemental tool to SMBG in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent hypoglycemic episodes. (E)

### Glucose control in hospitalized patients [^a9d88ffe]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia do not benefit from tight blood glucose control. Maintaining a blood glucose level of less than 180 mg per dL (9.99 mmol per L) will minimize symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia without adversely affecting patient-oriented health outcomes. In the absence of modifying factors, physicians should continue patients' at-home diabetes mellitus medications and randomly check glucose levels once daily. Sulfonylureas should be withheld to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with limited caloric intake. Patients with cardiovascular conditions may benefit from temporarily stopping treatment with thiazolidinediones to avoid precipitating heart failure. Metformin should be temporarily withheld in patients who have worsening renal function or who will undergo an imaging study that uses contrast. When patients need to be treated with insulin in the short term, using a long-acting basal insulin combined with a short-acting insulin before meals (with the goal of keeping blood glucose less than 180 mg per dL) better approximates normal physiology and uses fewer nursing resources than sliding-scale insulin approaches. Most studies have found that infusion with glucose, insulin, and potassium does not improve mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction should have moderate control of blood glucose using home regimens or basal insulin with correctional doses.

### Measuring glucose concentrations: daily practice, current and future developments [^4611fc8a]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) by means of modern glucose meters is of relevance for all patients with diabetes. It not only provides important information about the effect of therapeutic interventions on metabolic control, but about the effect of exercise and meals as well. Therefore, it is an essential part of diabetes therapy. However, it has received little interest from academia in the last 10 years. This is in sharp contrast to the massive increase in SMBG use in the last decades and its economic impact on health care systems. Many physicians and patients believe that SMBG and the measurement technologies behind it are a no-brainer nowadays, i.e., that the measurement provides reliable results in practically all cases. In reality, it appears as if patients have only mediocre knowledge about the appropriate handling of the procedure and subsequent therapeutic action. Also, evaluation of the measurement quality of blood glucose meters is not studied adequately in many cases. Such studies should also take into account handling by the patients themselves under daily life conditions. Unfortunately, most of such studies are initiated and sponsored by the manufacturers of blood glucose meters/test strips, and not by an independent institution. In view of the costs and risks combined with SMBG, we should consider that all patients participate in a course that ends with a little examination and provides them with a "driver's license" for this diagnostic measure.

### Frequency of blood glucose monitoring in relation to glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes [^a630ee1a]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between blood glucose level, measured as HbA(1c), and frequency of self-monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes. Daily self-monitoring is believed to be important for patients treated with insulin or oral agents to detect asymptomatic hypoglycemia and to guide patient and provider behavior toward reaching blood glucose goals.

Research Design and Methods

A national sample of patients with type 2 diabetes was studied in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Data on therapy for diabetes, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose, and HbA(1c) values were obtained by structured questionnaires and by clinical and laboratory assessments.

Results

According to the data, 29% of patients treated with insulin, 65% treated with oral agents, and 80% treated with diet alone had never monitored their blood glucose or monitored it less than once per month. Self-monitoring at least once per day was practiced by 39% of those taking insulin and 5–6% of those treated with oral agents or diet alone. For all patients combined, the proportion of patients who tested their blood glucose increased with an increasing HbA(1c) value. However, when examined by diabetes therapy category, there was little relationship between HbA(1c) value and the proportion testing at least once per day or the proportion testing at least once per week.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes, the increase in frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose with increasing HbA(1c) value was associated with the higher proportion of insulin-treated patients in higher HbA(1c) categories. Within diabetes therapy categories, the frequency of self-monitoring was not related to glycemic control, as measured by HbA(1c) level.

### Cost of self-monitoring of blood glucose in Canada among patients on an insulin regimen for diabetes [^dd035a81]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, an essential component of ongoing clinical and self-care management of diabetes is sufficient and accurate glycemic control, which is critical in preventing or postponing complications resulting from diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and peripheral vascular disease. The most common means for measuring glycemic control is by monitoring glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), which gives an average of the blood glucose over 3 months. A limitation of this method is that measuring HbA 1c levels does not tell patients what their blood glucose levels are on a regular, daily basis. Self-monitoring by testing for urinary glucose is one method of checking if blood glucose is high, but the limitation of this test is that it lacks the proven accuracy of other methods. A more precise reading can be captured by blood testing, which is performed by pricking the skin to obtain a drop of blood, placing that sample on a testing strip, and gauging the result with a discrete meter. This method, called self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), is quite flexible and convenient in that it can be done at various points throughout the day, prior to or following meals, or before or after physical activity, allowing patients to be constantly informed of their insulin levels.

SMBG in patients with diabetes who use insulin may contribute to improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia by allowing self-adjustments of insulin dose to be made based on meter readings. SMBG is recognized as a core component of effective diabetes self-management for insulin users throughout the world by major international organizations such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). SMBG is recommended by the Canadian Diabetes Association. The Canadian guidelines, while stating that the frequency of SMBG should be determined on an individual level, conclude that SMBG is an essential part of diabetes management for patients with type 1 diabetes and state that the benefits and optimal frequency are less clear for type 2.

Patient self-management is a key element in the control of diabetes, and is one of the most challenging regimens of any chronic illness. People with diabetes are asked to perform SMBG, manage multiple medications, maintain foot hygiene, adhere to diet and meal plans, and engage in exercise programs. While for some insulin users SMBG is an important component of diabetes care, it poses a significant inconvenience/burden on the patient, in addition to the significant and well-documented economic costs.

### What is so tough about self-monitoring of blood glucose? Perceived obstacles among patients with type 2 diabetes [^31dedb13]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To identify patient-reported obstacles to self-monitoring of blood glucose among those with Type 2, both insulin users and non-insulin users, and to investigate how obstacles are associated with frequency of self-monitoring and use of self-monitoring data.

Methods

Patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 886, 65% insulin users) who attended a 1-day diabetes education conference in cities across the USA completed a survey on current and recommended self-monitoring of blood glucose frequency, how they used self-monitoring results and perceived obstacles to self-monitoring use. Exploratory factor analysis examined 12 obstacle items to identify underlying factors. Regression analyses examined associations between self-monitoring of blood glucose use and the key obstacle factors identified in the exploratory factor analysis.

Results

Three obstacle factors emerged: Avoidance, Pointlessness and Burden. Avoidance was the only significant independent predictor of self-monitoring frequency (β = -0.23, P < 0.001). Avoidance (β = -0.12, P < 0.01) and Pointlessness (β = -0.15, P < 0.001) independently predicted how often self-monitoring data were shared with healthcare professionals and whether or not data were used to make management adjustments (Avoidance: odds ratio = 0.74, P < 0.001; Pointlessness: odds ratio = 0.75, P < 0.01). Burden was not associated with any of the self-monitoring behavioural measures. Few differences between insulin users and non-insulin users were noted.

Conclusions

Obstacles to self-monitoring of blood glucose use, both practical and emotional, were common. Higher levels of Avoidance and Pointlessness, but not Burden, were associated with less frequent self-monitoring use. Addressing patients' self-monitoring-related emotional concerns (Avoidance and Pointlessness) may be more beneficial in enhancing interest and engagement with self-monitoring of blood glucose than focusing on day-to-day, behavioural issues (Burden).

### Don't routinely recommend daily home glucose monitoring… [^845a53e5]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an integral part of patient self-management in maintaining safe and target-driven glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, daily finger glucose testing has no benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not on insulin or medications associated with hypoglycemia, and small, but significant, patient harms are associated with daily glucose testing. Self-monitoring of blood glucose should be reserved for patients during the titration of their medication doses or during periods of changes in patients' diet and exercise routines.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: right answer, but wrong question: self-monitoring of blood glucose can be clinically valuable for noninsulin users [^18b5994f]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, unlike a medication, SMBG is not a uniform intervention administered in an identical manner across all patients and settings. It varies considerably by the clinical question it addresses, the recommended frequency and timing of tests, the expertise of patients regarding its use, and the involvement and knowledge of clinicians in interpreting and responding to SMBG data. Like any good tool, SMBG may be used well or poorly. What Malanda et al. and other reviewers do not consider, and which should be included in the evaluation of any viable SMBG trial, is exactly how the SMBG "tool" was defined in the protocol of each study reviewed and how the resulting SMBG data were used clinically. Behavioral research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of health-related tools, such as SMBG, can be substantially magnified when there is comprehensive patient education, skills training, and — in the case of SMBG — structured data feedback, both in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. In the opposite case, where education and support for SMBG are minimal or nonexistent, perhaps we should not be surprised that glycemic benefits are also nonexistent. Therefore, it is simply not enough to report the significance of generic SMBG "treatment" effects using a general omnibus test. The ways in which SMBG are used must also be given due consideration — especially when the conclusions of such investigations are likely to have major implications for health policy.

What are the crucial parameters of SMBG interventions for this population that should be included in SMBG efficacy studies (none of which were examined in the review by Malanda et al.)? We suggest the following (see Table 1).

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: right answer, but wrong question: self-monitoring of blood glucose can be clinically valuable for noninsulin users [^da6dd7d0]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Given the importance of glycemic control in the development of diabetes complications, the plethora of tools now available to monitor the day-to-day trends in glycemia is remarkable. In this regard, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been considered a key component of patient management. Arguably, there remains almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to all diabetic patients regardless of current treatment strategy. However, recently there have been reports that have challenged the current paradigm that all patients should use SMBG and concluded that SMBG for type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin may not be beneficial on glycemic control and must be weighed against the expense and inconvenience. In the counterpoint narrative following the contribution by Malanda et al. Drs. Polonsky and Fisher provide a compelling argument suggesting that while it is evident that implementing SMBG in unstructured ways without training patients and clinicians is likely to be a waste of resources, there are effective and powerful ways to use structured SMBG in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetic patients. -William T.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^6eeb5e58]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The ADA consensus and position statements on SMBG provide a comprehensive review of the subject. Major clinical trials of insulin-treated patients that demonstrated the benefits of intensive glycemic control on diabetes complications have included SMBG as part of multifactorial interventions, suggesting that SMBG is a component of effective therapy. SMBG allows patients to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glycemic targets are being achieved. Results of SMBG can be useful in preventing hypoglycemia and adjusting medications (particularly prandial insulin doses), MNT, and physical activity.

The frequency and timing of SMBG should be dictated by the particular needs and goals of the patient. SMBG is especially important for patients treated with insulin in order to monitor for and prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. For most patients with type 1 diabetes and pregnant women taking insulin, SMBG is recommended three or more times daily. For these populations, significantly more frequent testing may be required to reach A1C targets safely without hypoglycemia. The optimal frequency and timing of SMBG for patients with type 2 diabetes on noninsulin therapy is unclear. A meta-analysis of SMBG in non–insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes concluded that some regimen of SMBG was associated with a reduction in A1C of 0.4%. However, many of the studies in this analysis also included patient education with diet and exercise counseling and, in some cases, pharmacologic intervention, making it difficult to assess the contribution of SMBG alone to improved control. Several recent trials have called into question the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of routine SMBG in non–insulin-treated patients.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^0b382810]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)

SMBG in diabetes management helps in making treatment decisions and correcting insulin dose. For optimal use of SMBG, regular review and interpretation by both the patients and physicians is required. In those individuals injecting insulin more than two times per day, SMBG should be done at least three times per day. However, there is insufficient evidence on the number of times SMBG needs to be done in individuals on once-daily insulin therapy, with or without OADs. Evidence from East Africa on the adherence to SMBG has shown suboptimal glycemic control, especially among those who had to pay for glucose strips. For optimal diabetes care in the region, to achieve adherence to SMBG and optimal glycemic control, it has been suggested that patient education be given alongside free glucose strips. Once-daily testing (preferably in the morning) should be done to assess the efficacy of the basal insulin dose. When HbA1c is > 7.0% (> 53 mmol/mol) in spite of a satisfactory FPG, a second test should be performed after the largest meal of the day to exclude postprandial hyperglycemia. In a low-resource setting, it may be considered not cost-effective to perform a postprandial test if the HbA1c is at target.

Recommendation

Pragmatic suggestions for SMBG should accompany insulin prescriptions (Grade D, EL IV)
Basal insulin is best monitored by FPG, 1–2 times a week (Grade A, EL II)
Prandial insulin is best monitored by paired premeal and postmeal glucose values (Grade A, EL II)
Premixed insulin is initially monitored by prebreakfast and predinner glucose values, followed by postprandial values (Grade A, EL 2)

Exercise

Exercise increases insulin sensitivity, and blood glucose should be checked before and after exercise and appropriate action taken.

Recommendation

Check blood glucose before and after exercise, and take appropriate action. If exercise is enduring, e.g. bicycle riding, check blood glucose in between exercise and take appropriate action (Grade A LE I)

### The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors: a European expert recommendation [^68603bab]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2014). Low credibility.

The role for the novel treatment approach of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) in type 2 diabetes is increasing. Structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), based on a less intensive and a more intensive scheme, may contribute to an optimization of SGLT-2 inhibitor based treatment. The current expert recommendation suggests individualized approaches of SMBG, using simple and clinically applicable schemes. Potential benefits of SMBG in SGLT-2 inhibitor based treatment approaches are early assessment of treatment success or failure, timely modification of treatment, detection of hypoglycemic episodes, assessment of glucose excursions, and support of diabetes management and education. The length and frequency of SMBG should depend on the clinical setting and the quality of metabolic control.

### Assessing glycemia in diabetes using self-monitoring blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^44392c42]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, successful management of blood glucose control is increasingly important. Current approaches to assessing glycemia include the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Objectives

To assess the evidence underlying the use of these 2 modalities, to evaluate confounders and sources of error in each test, to describe upcoming developments, and to reach evidence-based conclusions on their optimal use.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Reports identified from MEDLINE searches (1976–2005) using relevant terms were selected for quality and relevance to the stated questions. Particular attention was paid to larger cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and established recommendations.

Data Synthesis

If used properly SMBG gives an acceptably accurate reflection of immediate plasma glucose levels. Study results vary, but in general, the evidence supports a positive effect of regular SMBG for improving glycemia, particularly in individuals treated with insulin. The best timing of SMBG and its frequency are controversial issues, but the clinical recommendation is for regular monitoring with frequency depending on the treatment and the instability of glycemia. In the relatively near term, SMBG could gradually be replaced by continuous glucose monitoring. HbA1c measures long-term glycemic control, reflecting a time-weighted mean over the previous 3 to 4 months. There are a number of physiologic and methodologic confounders that can affect HbA1c, but standardization of assays has been well established. The main value of HbA1c is its use as a predictor of diabetic complications and the proven effect of improved control of HbA1c on complication risk. A reasonable target value for HbA1c is less than 7%. A new method for measuring HbA1c may cause significant changes in the recommended levels, the numbers reported, and even the name of the test.

Conclusion

Assessing glycemia in diabetes can be a challenge, but approaches are available that promote successful management of blood glucose and may thereby lead to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality related to diabetes.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes (the SMBG study): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^a453392e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended as a core element of self-management of diabetes when used appropriately following suitable training. In persons requiring insulin therapy, the information gained from SMBG can be used to adjust lifestyle (nutrition and physical activity) and insulin doses to optimise glycaemic control. However, the benefit of SMBG in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes has not been a consistent finding in the limited number of randomised control trials (RCTs) published to date. Consequently, NICE have recently issued guidelines similar to the US, Canada and Australia, recommending limiting the use of SMBG in people with type 2 diabetes. However, current recommendations make allowances where there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes, the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery, during pregnancy, or when planning to become pregnant. If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, NICE now recommends a structured assessment should be carried out at least annually.

The studies conducted on SMBG have varied in terms of their methodology, populations and intervention (format of SMBG). However, 'structured SMBG', involving regular 'paired blood glucose testing' (pre and post meal) to identify patterns of glycaemic control along with education to interpret the results and action taken to correct any abnormalities, has consistently demonstrated clear benefits with improved HbA1c and well-being. This approach is now generally recommended as the optimum method for blood glucose self- monitoring. Clinical practice suggests that many with type 2 diabetes perform SMBG but do not act on the results thus underutilising its potential benefit in terms of necessary adjustment of lifestyle and/or dose of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Often, people with type 2 diabetes have not had the necessary education or training to adjust their lifestyle or oral medication even if they are aware that their blood glucose results are abnormal.

In 2014/15, NHS expenditure on blood glucose monitoring agents and devices in England was £175.2 million. This represents an increase of 23% since 2005/06 accounting for just over 20% of the total cost of diabetes treatments in England that year. Despite the continued year on year rise in expenditure, HbA1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes have remained static with only approximately 66% reaching the NICE recommended target of 58 mmol/mol (≤ 7.5%). As a consequence the debate continues regarding the value of SMBG in people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin therapy.

Although extensive dosing instructions for insulin are beyond the scope of this statement, most patients can be taught to uptitrate their own insulin dose based on several algorithms, each essentially involving the addition of a small dose increase if hyperglycemia persists. For example, the addition of 1–2 units (or, in those already on higher doses, increments of 5–10%) to the daily dose once or twice weekly if the fasting glucose levels are above the preagreed target is a reasonable approach. As the target is neared, dosage adjustments should be more modest and occur less frequently. Downward adjustment is advisable if any hypoglycemia occurs. During self-titration, frequent contact (telephone, e-mail) with the clinician may be necessary. Practitioners themselves can, of course, also titrate basal insulin, but this would involve more intensive contact with the patient than typically available in routine clinical practice. Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose is of obvious importance during this phase. After the insulin dose is stabilized, the frequency of monitoring should be reviewed.

Consideration should be given to the addition of prandial or mealtime insulin coverage when significant postprandial glucose excursions (e.g. to > 10.0 mmol/L [> 180 mg/dL]) occur. This is suggested when the fasting glucose is at target but the HbA 1c remains above goal after 3–6 months of basal insulin titration. The same would apply if large drops in glucose occur during overnight hours or in between meals, as the basal insulin dose is increased. In this scenario, the basal insulin dose would obviously need to be simultaneously decreased as prandial insulin is initiated. Although basal insulin is titrated primarily against the fasting glucose, generally irrespective of the total dose, practitioners should be aware that the need for prandial insulin therapy will become likely the more the daily dose exceeds 0.5 U kg −1 day −1, especially as it approaches 1 U kg −1 day −1. The aim with mealtime insulin is to blunt postprandial glycemic excursions, which can be extreme in some individuals, resulting in poor control during the day. Such coverage may be provided by one of two methods.

### Brazilian multicenter study for the evaluation of patients' satisfaction of blood glucose self-monitoring with BGStar® blood glucose meter in insulinized patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 [^de3371de]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Self-management of diabetes remains the cornerstone of diabetes care. An overall self-management strategy would be greatly beneficial to people with diabetes as well as to their families. Major clinical trials of insulin-treated patients have included SMBG as part of the multifactorial interventions to demonstrate the benefit of intensive glycemic control on diabetes complications. SMBG is thus an integral component of effective therapy. Also, evidence points out that more frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is associated with clinically and statistically better glycemic control regardless of diabetes type or therapy.

SMBG should be considered and evaluated in conjunction with all other aspects of diabetes self-management and care. The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) clinical practice guidelines for prevention and management of diabetes recommend that SMBG should be individualized for each person with diabetes based on their circumstances and needs, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend that patient's specific needs and goals should dictate SMBG frequency and timing. This would help individuals to avoid hypoglycemic episodes during dose modifications, to correctly adjust medications, to evaluate individual response to therapy and assess if glycemic targets are being achieved.

Determination of blood glucose values through BGM should be performed regularly by insulin-treated diabetic patients, and the values obtained from these glucose readings should be used to direct and guide insulin dosing on daily basis. In order to allow good treatment efficacy and safety, BGMs need to be robust, easy to use, accurate and reliable.

Programmatic, structured SMBG contributes to significant improvement in glycemic control in diabetic patients under insulin regimen. But SMBG accuracy depends on the instrument and user, so these are important aspects to be considered. Optimal use of SMBG requires proper review and interpretation of data, both by patients and physicians: patients should be taught how to use SMBG data to adjust food intake, exercise, or pharmacological therapy to achieve specific goals as well as to monitor and prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^033bcbfc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Exercise glucose monitoring in insulin-dependent diabetes — structured timing and targets are advised during wilderness activity. Ideally, pre-exercise blood glucose monitoring should be performed 2 to 3 times at 30 min intervals to determine a blood glucose trend; during exercise, every 30 min; and after exercise, every 2 to 4 h owing to potential delayed hypoglycemia. It has been suggested that the ideal blood glucose level for exercise is between 130 and 180 mg·dL-1, though targets should be individualized. Because such time-intensive monitoring is difficult in the wilderness, it is prudent to establish trends in insulin and carbohydrate requirements before an expedition; patients with well-established exercise insulin requirements may check blood glucose prior to exercise and every few hours during prolonged exertion, and continuous glucose monitors (CGM) may be a useful adjunctive tool though robust clinical data are lacking. Recommendation: In insulin-dependent diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored before, during, and after intense and/or prolonged exercise (Evidence grade: 1B).

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (glucose monitoring, T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to advise all young patients with T1DM to monitor glucose levels multiple times daily (up to 10 times/day by blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring), including before meals and snacks, at bedtime, and as needed for safety in specific situations, such as physical activity, driving, or the presence of symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^a727dc12]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent diabetes management guidelines specify that treatment goals should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and duration of disease, with an American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) goal of ≤ 6.5% (≤ 48 mmol/mol) in otherwise healthy patients. Although HbA 1c is the target, it is measured once every 3 months, and day-to-day self-management of diabetes to achieve and maintain the individualized target HbA 1c is facilitated by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values, especially in patients treated with insulin. To achieve the recommended HbA 1c goals, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the AACE, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have recommend SMBG targets (Table 1), the origins of which are obscure but appear to be based predominantly on expert opinion. As a result, there is wide variation in the recommended SMBG targets to achieve a HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) and little to guide clinicians and patients on how to achieve other, individualized, targets.

Summary of current SMBG targets

We sought to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime glucose values, based on empirical data, to achieve and maintain target HbA 1c levels in the outpatient setting.

### The experience of blood glucose monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [^61e6a45c]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Respondents often did not know how accurate their metre was and did not have the opportunity to discuss metre performance with a health care professional when choosing a blood glucose metre. Patients reported little choice over the metre they are offered with local guidelines typically limiting the choice of equipment to control costs and ensure value for money. It's not unreasonable for patients to assume that the blood glucose monitoring equipment on offer/prescribed have been evaluated for effectiveness as well as cost ‐ so there is a degree of trust that what is being offered to them is of an adequate standard. This was apparent in some of the comments made by the respondents.

In the same study, some of those interviewed reported concerns over whether they were managing their BG levels correctly, achieving stable and consistent BG levels over a period of time, administering medication correctly, whether their diabetes was 'stable' and/or whether there had been any implications of having diabetes on areas of their health (such as neuropathy). Individuals noted that there was a degree of stress with the 'review appointments', and spoke of concerns of being 'told off' at these reviews.

In our study, we found that 52% of respondents were concerned that they might be over‐ or under‐dosing their insulin. Although 63% of people expressed confidence in the accuracy of their BG metre, only 25% of patients responded that they had sufficient information. In relation to the matter of BG metre accuracy when their latest metre was provided only 9% remembered a discussion about this. This indicates a large gap in patient education in this area. In some cases there may be limited attention paid to the accuracy/precision of the BG metres provided to patients as long as they fall within the fairly liberal ISO standards. This is reflected in the fact that 30% of those questioned reported keeping their BG levels high to avoid hypoglycaemic episodes.

In all, 51% of patients reported an HbA1c of 64 mmol/mol or less. That is lower than in our previous analysis of England general practice databut may reflect the fact that all the people studied here were taking insulin. Encouragingly, 75% reported having had an HbA1c check in the last 6 months. This is in keeping with our previous data, although our survey was carried out before the coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in many HbA1c tests not being performed on time in the UK, and probably elsewhere in the world according to a WHO survey describing disruption to diabetes services.

Blood glucose monitoring (SMBG) — self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be recommended for all persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are treated with multiple daily doses (MDI) of insulin therapy or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy; frequent BGM may be needed for persons who are taking multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or using insulin pumps; in persons at A1C targets, or those with history of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, lean body mass, or previous severe hypoglycemia; and persons who do not require insulin or insulin secretagogue therapy may not benefit from BGM.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^9f1b3594]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A 2009 review of studies of patients with type 2 diabetes addressed recent large randomized trials of tight glycemic control, a major rationale for SMBG use in these patients. It concluded that "tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs and offers uncertain benefits in return", thus raising additional uncertainty about the use of SMBG in people with type 2 diabetes.

2. Rationale

Knowledge of ambient plasma or blood glucose concentrations is used by insulin-requiring patients, particularly those with type 1 diabetes, as an aid in determining appropriate insulin doses at different times of the day. Patients adjust the amount of insulin according to their plasma or blood glucose concentration. Frequent SMBG is particularly important for tight glycemic control in type 1 diabetes.

Hypoglycemia is a major, potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of diabetes. The risk of hypoglycemia is seen primarily in patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and it increases substantially when pharmacologic therapy is directed towards maintaining the glycemic concentrations as close to those found in nondiabetic individuals as is safely possible. The incidence of major hypoglycemic episodes — requiring third-party help or medical intervention — was 2- to 3-fold higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the conventional group in clinical trials of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, many patients with diabetes, particularly those with type 1, lose the autonomic warning symptoms that normally precede neuroglycopenia ("hypoglycemic unawareness"), increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. SMBG can be useful for detecting asymptomatic hypoglycemia and allowing patients to avoid major hypoglycemic episodes.

3. Analytical considerations

RECOMMENDATION: PATIENTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED IN THE CORRECT USE OF GLUCOSE METERS, INCLUDING QUALITY CONTROL. COMPARISON BETWEEN SMBG AND CONCURRENT LABORATORY GLUCOSE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE METERS IN THE PATIENT'S HANDS B (moderate).

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: it is time to face the evidence [^a4c4e119]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is considered a key component of the treatment regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin. There is almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to all diabetic patients. Even for patients not using insulin, the use of SMBG is widely taken up in clinical practice guidelines and is accepted as a part of their diabetes management.

SMBG is used as an early warning to detect or confirm hypoglycemia and to improve patients' recognition of severe hyperglycemia. Given that real-time data on blood glucose levels reflects the influence of physical activity and diet, SMBG has the potential to help patients better understand the impact of lifestyle on glycemic control. Furthermore, information derived from consecutive series' of SMBG measurements could be of use for a treating physician to modify the glucose-lowering treatment. Despite these potential benefits, there is a limited evidence base for an effect of SMBG on hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients using insulin. We have summarized and labeled the available evidence of an effect of SMBG on HbA 1c and hypoglycemia in patients using insulin (type 1 and type 2 diabetes) and patients not using insulin (type 2 diabetes) using a grading system modeled after existing methods (Table 1). At this point, we will discuss the lack of evidence of an effect of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin.

### The efficacy and frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose in non-insulin-treated T2D patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b7403fb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a useful tool in diabetes management, but its efficacy and optimal application in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients treated without insulin have been controversial. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of SMBG in controlling blood glucose levels in non-insulin-treated T2D patients and to determine the optimal frequency and the most appropriate population to benefit from SMBG.

Methods

Eligible publications from January 2000 to April 2022 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing SMBG with no SMBG or structured SMBG (S-SMBG, SMBG with defined timing and frequency of glucose measurements) were included. Meta-analyses and sub-analyses were performed to assess the efficacy, optimal frequency, and most appropriate population for SMBG. Risk of bias was assessed regarding randomization, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases.

Results

Twenty-two studies involving 6204 participants were identified, including 17 comparing SMBG with no SMBG and 4 comparing SMBG with S-SMBG. SMBG reduced HbA1c (MD -0.30%, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.17) compared with no SMBG, and S-SMBG performed better than SMBG (MD -0.23%, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.07). Subgroup analyses showed that HbA1c control was better with SMBG at 8–11 times weekly (MD -0.35%, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.20) compared with other frequencies and with lifestyle adjustments (MD -0.37%, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.23) than with no adjustments. No significant differences in HbA1c were observed between baseline HbA1c subgroups (≤ 8% and > 8%, P = 0.63) and between diabetes duration subgroups (≤ 6 years and > 6 years, P = 0.72), respectively.

Discussion

SMBG was effective for controlling HbA1c in non-insulin-treated T2D patients, although lacking detailed monitoring design. Better outcomes were seen with SMBG at 8–11 times weekly and lifestyle adjustment based on SMBG results.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^c4876355]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — glucose monitoring strategy follows ADA standards: Data for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes and CKD essentially are absent; therefore, assessment of glycemic control should follow the general standards recommended by the ADA, with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) recommended 3 or more times daily in people receiving multiple insulin injections and, for those treated by oral agents or medical nutrition therapy, SMBG is useful in achieving glycemic goals; postprandial SMBG testing also may be helpful, particularly in patients with gastroparesis. The optimal frequency of SMBG has not been established in patients with type 2 diabetes treated by oral agents, but the ADA recommends testing sufficiently often to reach glycemic goals, and HbA1c level should be determined at least twice per year in stable patients and more often, approximately every 3 months, in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not reaching goals.

### Continuous glucose monitoring: evidence and consensus statement for clinical use [^99f4576e]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2013). Low credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an essential tool for modern diabetes therapy. Randomized controlled studies have provided evidence that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results can be improved in patients with type 1 diabetes with elevated baseline HbA1c when using CGM frequently enough and that the frequency and duration of hypoglycemic events can be reduced in patients with satisfactory baseline HbA1c. The CGM group within the Working Group Diabetes Technology (AGDT) of the German Diabetes Association (DDG) has defined evidence-based indications for the practical use of CGM in this consensus statement related to hypoglycemia (frequent, severe, or nocturnal) or hypoglycemia unawareness, insufficient metabolic control despite use of all possible therapeutic options and patient compliance, pregnancy associated with inadequate blood glucose results, and the need for more than 10 blood glucose measurements per day. Contraindications and defined preconditions for the successful use of CGM should be considered.

Importance of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Following Initiation of Insulin Therapy

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) constitutes one of the key tools for the management of diabetes mellitus. The self-monitoring of glucose levels encourages, empowers, and enables persons with diabetes to understand the effects of lifestyle changes and medications on their blood glucose levels. It also allows persons with diabetes to implement the required interventions to help improve their glycemic control. Evidence suggests improved glycemic control in persons with T2DM who regularly use SMBG. Self-monitoring of the blood glucose levels also helps persons detect hypoglycemia and adjust their insulin dosage appropriately.

At the initiation visit, clear instructions should be given to persons on how to self-monitor their blood glucose level. Simple and specific steps should be used to teach SMBG, based on each person's level of comprehension. Written recommendations for the frequency of testing and time of testing with desired results should be provided. The SMBG procedure should be taught at the initial visit and re-emphasized at follow-up visits.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: it is time to face the evidence [^c7993a0c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Given the importance of glycemic control in the development of diabetes complications, the plethora of tools now available to monitor the day-to-day trends in glycemia is remarkable. In this regard, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been considered a key component of patient management. Arguably, there remains almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to all diabetic patients regardless of current treatment strategy. However, recently there have been reports that have challenged the current paradigm that all patients should use SMBG and concluded that SMBG for type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin may not be beneficial on glycemic control and must be weighed against the expense and inconvenience. In this two-part point-counterpoint narrative, Malanda et al. and Polonsky and Fisher take opposing views on the utility of SMBG to be valuable for individuals with type 2 diabetes not using insulin. In the narrative below, Malanda et al. suggest that the evidence for potentially beneficial SMBG-induced effects on glycemic control, hypoglycemic periods, and potential harms in type 2 diabetic patients who are not treated with insulin does not justify the use of SMBG. Moreover, the use of SMBG is associated with huge costs, which should be better redirected to effective strategies to improve health for this category of patients. -William T.

Evidence base — education and training for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and other diabetes technologies: Diabetes education and training are essential to optimizing use of CGM; persons with diabetes should be advised that if symptoms do not match sensor glucose values it would be prudent to check a capillary blood glucose level, and individualized alarms should be set to prevent alarm fatigue while monitoring for skin problems and sensor adhesion issues that can create data gaps; this section is labeled Grade C; BEL 2. Understanding how to safely and effectively use CGM data for daily diabetes self-management and how to interpret and learn from retrospective data are essential, and if the sensor is not lasting for its intended duration there will be gaps when no data are available if insurance limits the supply of devices.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose among adults with diabetes – United States, 1997–2006 [^2db25206]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Blood-glucose control is critical for managing diabetes and preventing diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. In addition to recommending that patients with diabetes have a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement at least two times a year, the American Diabetes Association recommends self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as an integral part of diabetes management for patients who are treated with insulin and as a useful component for achieving glycemic goals for patients who use oral medications or medical nutrition therapy. One of the Healthy People 2010 national objectives is to increase to 61% the proportion of persons with diabetes who perform SMBG at least once a day (objective 5–17). To estimate the rates of SMBG and to track the progress of states during 1997–2006, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for that period. This report summarizes the findings of that analysis, which indicated that the proportion of adults with diabetes who check their blood glucose at least once a day increased at the national level, and 25 of the 38 states examined had statistically significant rate increases from 1997 to 2006. In 2006, the daily SMBG rate was 63.4% among all adults with diabetes and 86.7% among those treated with insulin. Collaborations to ensure adequate health insurance coverage, diabetes education and counseling to encourage more intensive medical care and self-management practices, and continued surveillance measures to track changes in SMBG rates are needed to improve and monitor SMBG trends.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^714147c0]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATION: STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE ANALYTICAL GOALS (QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS) FOR GLUCOSE METERS IN SMBG AND IN ICUs C (moderate).

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: IMPORTANT END POINTS IN STUDIES OF SMBG SHOULD INCLUDE, AT A MINIMUM, HbA 1c AND FREQUENCY OF HYPOGLYCEMIC EPISODES TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER IMPROVED METERS ENABLE PATIENTS TO ACHIEVE BETTER GLUCOSE CONTROL. FOR STUDIES OF METER USE IN INTENSIVE OR CRITICAL CARE, IMPORTANT END POINTS INCLUDE MEAN BLOOD GLUCOSE, FREQUENCY OF HYPOGLYCEMIA, AND VARIATION OF GLUCOSE CONTROL. IDEALLY, OUTCOMES (E.G. LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS) SHOULD ALSO BE EXAMINED GPP.

4. Interpretation

A. Frequency of measurement.

SMBG should be performed at least 3 times per day in patients with type 1 diabetes. Monitoring less frequently than 3 times per day leads to deterioration in glycemic control. Patients perform self-monitoring much less frequently than recommended. Data from NHANES III collected between 1988 and 1994 reveal that SMBG was performed at least once a day by 39% of patients taking insulin and by 5%–6% of patients treated with oral agents or diet alone. Moreover, 29% and 65% of patients treated with insulin and oral agents, respectively, monitored their blood glucose less than once per month; however, no evaluation has been performed to verify that 3 times per day is ideal or whether a different frequency would improve glycemic control. For example, adjustment of insulin therapy in women with GDM according to the results of postprandial, rather than preprandial, plasma glucose concentrations improved glycemic control and reduced the risk of neonatal complications. The optimal frequency of SMBG for patients with type 2 diabetes is unknown.

The ADA recommends that patients treated with multiple daily injections of insulin perform SMBG ≥ 3 times per day and states that "SMBG is useful in achieving glycemic goals" in other patients. The last statement is based on expert opinion.

### Blood glucose self-monitoring and internet diabetes management on A1c outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^5781fc29]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose not found to affect A1C in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
Frequency of submission of online reports of blood glucose found to be correlated with A1C and frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose.
For patients who tested frequently, a difference in A1C was found between reporting frequently and infrequently, where no difference was found in those who tested infrequently.

The day-to-day management of diabetes mellitus is a complex and consistent challenge for patients and healthcare providers alike. Established patient self-management tools, such as self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), are now being used in tandem with information technology and telecommunications to provide a more integrated management of the disease.

The benefits of intensive glycemic control have long been established both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and include reduced rates of microvascular complications, with SMBG providing the means to monitor progress and avoid hypoglycemia. Although SMBG is well supported for frequent use in insulin-dependent diabetes, there is controversy over self-testing in non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and a lack of research on the importance of testing frequency on clinical outcomes.

One line of reasoning as to why SMBG cannot consistently be shown to demonstrate an effect in non-insulin-dependent diabetes lies in the variability of decision-making as a result of SMBG. With the advent of online communications, the Internet-based Blood Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS) is a technology that is used to augment SMBG by giving patients the means to communicate their blood glucose levels to their healthcare provider for actionable feedback. This technology has been shown to reduce A1C in several randomized controlled trials for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between A1C, frequency of SMBG, and frequency of IBGMS reporting for patients with type 2 diabetes solely on oral medications.

GLUCOSE METERS

Portable meters for the measurement of blood glucose concentrations are used in three major settings: 1) in acute- and chronic-care facilities, including intensive care units (ICUs); 2) in physicians' offices; and 3) by patients at home, work, and school. Measurement in the last setting, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), was performed at least once per day by 40% and 26% of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, in the U.S. in 1993. The overall rate of daily SMBG among adults with diabetes in the U.S. increased to 40.6% in 1997 and to 63.4% in 2006. The ADA summarized the uses of SMBG as early as 1987 [see and references therein] and currently recommends that SMBG be carried out ≥ 3 times daily by patients who use multiple insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. It is recommended that most individuals with diabetes attempt to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations as close to those in nondiabetic individuals as is safely possible.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose as part of the integral care of type 2 diabetes [^e7500dff]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Over the last 2 decades, it was firmly established that tight glycemic control is associated with a significant reduction in serious long-term diabetes-related complications. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated that treatment that maintains blood glucose levels near normal in type 1 diabetes delays the onset and reduces the progression of microvascular complications. In the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study, each 1% reduction in A1C was associated with a 37% decrease in relative risk for microvascular complications and a 21% decrease in relative risk of any end point or death related to diabetes.

Assessing glycemia in the management of diabetes has always been a challenge. The urine glucose testing provided a noninvasive inexpensive proof of severe hyperglycemia; nevertheless, the method was seriously limited by being only semi-quantitative, retrospective, and significantly dependent on the patient's individual threshold, detecting only concentrations above this threshold. In the 1970s and 1980s, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and A1C testing became available. In the 1990s, the continuous measurement of glucose in subcutaneous tissue was introduced.

Glycosylated hemoglobin remains the gold standard marker for assessing long-term glycemic control. What still remains elusive is to which extent the retrospective reflection of the average glycemia of the past 100–120 days, as expressed by A1C, reflects, even within the normal range, a secure nondeleterious effect of hyperglycemic excursions or hypoglycemic nadir on organ targets. However, A1C does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions.

To the contrary, SMBG reveals the immediate hour-to-hour blood glucose, which in people without diabetes, varies only ∼50% throughout the day but may vary up to10-fold in patients with diabetes. Real-time information provided by SMBG represents an important adjunct to A1C, because it can track fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, detect glycemic excursions and hypoglycemia, and ultimately provides on-the-spot information about the instant effects of food choice, physical activity, and medication on glycemic control. In fact, SMBG can aid in diabetes control by doing the following: facilitating the development of an individualized blood glucose profile, which can then guide doctors in treatment planning for an individualized diabetic regimen; offering patients with diabetes the ability to make appropriate day-to-day treatment choices in diet and physical activity as well as in insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents; and improving patient recognition of hypoglycemia. If the principle of data-driven feedback governs the treatment adaptation, SMBG could ultimately show effectiveness in significantly lowering A1C.

### Meta-analysis of individual patient data in randomised trials of self monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes [^987fd163]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of self monitoring blood glucose levels in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes compared with clinical management without self monitoring, and to explore the effects in specific patient groups.

Design

Meta-analysis based on individual participant data.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and a recent systematic review of trials on self monitoring of blood glucose. Chief investigators of trials published since 2000 were approached for additional information and individual patient data.

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes comparing an intervention using self monitoring of blood glucose with clinical management not using self monitoring. Trials published from 2000 with at least 80 participants were included.

Data Collection

Individual patient data were collected from electronic files and checked for integrity.

Analysis

All randomised participants were analysed using the intention to treat principle. A random effects model of complete cases was used to assess efficacy, a sensitivity analysis comprised imputed data, and prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for age, sex, previous use of self monitoring, duration of diabetes, and levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at baseline.

Results

2552 patients were randomised in the six included trials. A mean reduction in HbA(1c) level of -2.7 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval -3.9 to -1.6; 0.25%) was observed for those using self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with no self monitoring at six months. The mean reduction in HbA(1c) level between groups was 2.0 mmol/mol (3.2 to 0.8; 0.25%) at three months (five trials) and 2.5 mmol/mol (4.1 to 0.9; 0.35%) at 12 months (three trials). These estimates were unchanged after imputing missing data, and estimates of effect in trials with higher loss to follow-up or a possibility of co-intervention compared with those with lower loss to follow-up and no co-intervention did not differ significantly (P = 0.21). The difference in HbA(1c) levels between groups was consistent across age, baseline HbA(1c) level, sex, and duration of diabetes, although the numbers of older and younger people and those with HbA(1c) levels > 86 mmol/mol (10%) were insufficient for interpretation. No changes occurred in systolic blood pressure (-0.2 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval -1.4 to 1.0), diastolic blood pressure (-0.1 mm Hg, -0.9 to 0.6), or total cholesterol level (-0.1 mol/L, 95% confidence interval -0.2 to 0.1).

Conclusions

Evidence from this meta-analysis of individual patient data was not convincing for a clinically meaningful effect of clinical management of non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes by self monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with management without self monitoring, although the difference in HbA(1c) level between groups was statistically significant. The difference in levels was consistent across subgroups defined by personal and clinical characteristics.

Educate on the Importance of Individualized A1C Targets

It is important that people living with T2D understand the concept of A1C, it is a historical measurement, and the reasons for setting A1C targets. The ADA Standards of Care state that for many non-pregnant adults, an A1C target of < 7% is appropriate; however, they add that this should be adapted based on characteristics such as age, disease duration, and other illness. For example, for healthy older people with T2D (i.e. those with few coexisting chronic illnesses and intact cognitive function and functional status), A1C goals of between 7% and 7.5% are appropriate, while for those with limited life expectancy, or where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefit, less stringent A1C goals (for example, 8%) may be appropriate. The ADA Standards of Care recommend that glycemic status is assessed twice a year for those with stable glycemia, whereas in people who have recently changed therapy and/or who are not meeting glycemic goals, it should be assessed more frequently, for example quarterly, or as needed.

As A1C is an indirect measure of glycemia over time, it is important to differentiate it from other blood glucose tests, such as fasting or postprandial tests, which are used to measure glucose levels at any one time point.

Advise the Use of Home Glucose Monitoring

People who actively manage their blood glucose can gain better control of their T2D compared with those who do not. The use of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can provide valuable information for many patients. The patient and the HCP should discuss patient preference regarding the frequency of testing and recommendations made thereafter. People with T2D need to be aware that the frequency of blood glucose monitoring varies according to treatment. For example, the usual recommendation for blood glucose monitoring when receiving basal insulin is before breakfast or bedtime, but this is increased for regimens that require multiple injections of insulin. The HCP should explain to the patient how these readings are used to interpret overall glycemic control and to assess for fasting and/or postprandial hyper- or hypoglycemia, and to guide dose adjustments and food choices. Use of SMBG/CGM provides an opportunity to enhance the HCP–patient relationship through information that can be used to support and educate the patient, and inform overall shared decision-making.

Blood glucose (BG) monitoring — general principles for youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) state that once BG concentrations are at target levels, the frequency of monitoring can be modified; patients who are prone to marked hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia or on regimens with increased hypoglycemia risk will require continued frequent BG testing, and expectations for frequency and timing should be clearly defined with a written action plan for the adolescent and family.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^dcf9cd36]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

### The impact of blood glucose self-monitoring on metabolic control and quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients: an urgent need for better educational strategies [^4cd4fad9]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 2 diabetes is still a matter of debate. In the framework of a nationwide outcomes research program, we investigated the frequency of SMBG and its association with metabolic control and quality of life (QoL).

Research Design and Methods

The study involved 3,567 patients with type 2 diabetes who were recruited by 101 outpatient diabetes clinics and 103 general practitioners. Patients completed a questionnaire investigating SMBG practice and QoL (diabetes-related stress, diabetes health distress, diabetes-related worries, and Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale).

Results

Data on SMBG were available for 2,855 subjects (80% of the entire study population). Overall, 471 patients (17%) stated that they tested their blood glucose levels at home ≥ 1 time per day, 899 patients (31%) tested their blood glucose levels ≥ 1 time per week, and 414 patients (14%) tested their blood glucose levels < 1 time per week, whereas 1,071 patients (38%) stated that they never practiced SMBG. A higher frequency of SMBG was associated with better metabolic control among subjects who were able to adjust insulin doses, whereas no relationship was found in all other patients, irrespective of the kind of treatment. Multivariate analyses showed that an SMBG frequency ≥ 1 time per day was significantly related to higher levels of distress, worries, and depressive symptoms in non-insulin-treated patients.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that SMBG can have an important role in improving metabolic control if it is an integral part of a wider educational strategy devoted to the promotion of patient autonomy. In patients not treated with insulin, self-monitoring is associated with higher HbA(1c) levels and psychological burden. Our data do not support the extension of SMBG to this group.

### Adherence of self-monitoring of blood glucose in persons with type 1 diabetes in Sweden [^2fed0da9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In persons with type 1 diabetes, obtaining good glycemic control is crucial in avoiding microvascular and macrovascular complications from the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and cardiovascular system, and reducing excess mortality. Simultaneously, it is important to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, which leads to considerable discomfort and risk of serious complications for many patients. Previous studies have shown a correlation between frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The difference in HbA1c between those not measuring their blood glucose at all and those measuring only a few times every week, but not daily, has been shown to be negligible. In comparison, the difference between those never or seldom measuring and those measuring 3–4 times per day is about 1% (10 mmol/mol). The difference between measuring 3–4 times per day and measuring 10 times per day has also been shown to have an effect on HbA1c of about 1% (10 mmol/mol).

The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, suggest a partly individualized number of SMBG measurements per day for patients on intensive insulin regimes (multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump). SMBG is recommended at least 4 times per day, but for many patients 6–10 times per day is appropriate to achieve good metabolic control. Earlier studies on patients with diabetes type 1 have shown varying adherence to guidelines, from two-thirds of patients not performing daily SMBG, to 85% of patients measuring 3 times per day or more. Some studies are limited to patients downloading blood glucose meter data at the clinic, probably leaving out a large proportion of non-adherent patients. Many modern studies are focused on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); however, a vast majority of patients are limited to traditional blood glucose meters because of limited reimbursement of CGM. Therefore, more recent data on patient adherence to modern guidelines using traditional blood glucose meters is weak, especially in Sweden, where no such study has been conducted.

The aim of the present study was to describe the proportion of patients measuring blood glucose levels at least 4 times per day. Secondary objectives were to further investigate possible predictors for good SMBG adherence as well as studying the association between SMBG frequency and HbA1c.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not using insulin [^8ab6e855]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been found to be effective for patients with type 1 diabetes and for patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin. There is much debate on the effectiveness of SMBG as a tool in the self-management for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin.

Objectives

To assess the effects of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not using insulin.

Search Methods

Multiple electronic bibliographic and ongoing trial databases were searched supplemented with handsearches of references of retrieved articles (date of last search: 07 July 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of SMBG compared with usual care, self-monitoring of urine glucose (SMUG) or both in patients with type 2 diabetes who where not using insulin. Studies that used glycosylated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) as primary outcome were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from included studies and evaluated the studies' risk of bias. Data from the studies were compared to decide whether they were sufficiently homogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were HbA(1c), health-related quality of life, well-being and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose level, hypoglycaemic episodes, morbidity, adverse effects and costs.

Main Results

Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients. Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks). Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG, one study was a three-armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG with usual care and one study was a three-armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group. Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators. Meta-analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA(1c) at up to six months follow-up (-0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non-significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow-up (-0.1; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials). Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well-being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. Two trials reported costs of self-monitoring: One trial compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose with self-monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self-monitoring in 1990. Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were £89 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), £181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and £173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group. Higher losses to follow-up in the more intensive self-monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self-monitoring group. There were few data on the effects on other outcomes and these effects were not statistically significant. None of the studies reported data on morbidity.

Authors' Conclusions

From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: right answer, but wrong question: self-monitoring of blood glucose can be clinically valuable for noninsulin users [^64377256]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Further concerns about study design

The studies included in the report by Malanda et al. and other recent reviews raise additional concerns about how SMBG efficacy studies of insulin-naïve type 2 diabetic patients have been designed and implemented. A report by the International Diabetes Federation, along with several other publications, suggests that many SMBG trials have serious design flaws that increase the probability of a type 1 error. For example, some studies included patients with baseline A1Cs far too low to benefit from the intervention; in other studies, only patients — not clinicians — were randomized, so that the same clinicians saw patients from both study arms. This can lead to the "bleeding" of SMBG benefits across study arms, thus reducing between-group differences. Furthermore, SMBG protocols are unlikely to be beneficial if patients do not follow them. Poor adherence to SMBG recommendations has been a perennial problem, noted to be as high as 48% among some studies, yet all but one used only intention-to-treat analyses. No effort was made to determine the effectiveness of SMBG among patients who actually tested (per protocol analyses), nor were efforts devoted to determine why some patients tested and some did not. Thus, intention-to-treat analyses confounded the effectiveness of SMBG with patient motivation to test. And that motivation, we suggest, is directly tied to how SMBG is introduced, taught, and used by both patients and clinicians in a collaborative and clinically meaningful way.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with non-… [^9717fb4d]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

A. F. reports that they check their blood glucose one to three times daily using a home glucose monitor, as recommended by their previous physician. I recommend discontinuing self-monitoring of their blood glucose because its effectiveness in achieving glycemic control is limited in patients who are not taking insulin. A. F. becomes upset by my suggestion, wondering how they can keep their diabetes under control without checking their glucose levels at home. How do I respond to my new patient. Until recently, self-monitoring of blood glucose was a routine recommendation for all patients with diabetes, including those not taking insulin. Among patients who do not use insulin, a growing body of evidence validates that self-monitoring of blood glucose is not effective in achieving long-term glycemic control.

A 2012 Cochrane review, which compiled data from 12 randomized controlled trials, showed that patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes who self-monitored their blood glucose levels did not have clinically significant improvements in glycemic control after one year. 1 More recently, a 2017 study assigned patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes to one of three groups: no self-monitoring, once-daily self-monitoring, and once-daily self-monitoring with enhanced patient feedback, including automatic messages about the results delivered via the glucose meter. This trial found no notable differences in A1C levels across all groups at one year and no differences in health-related quality of life.
2. As a result, multiple professional societies have recommended against prescribing self-monitoring for patients with non–insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes.

As part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Society of General Internal Medicine have recommended against physicians prescribing self-monitoring for these patients. 6, 7 Nevertheless, routine self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes persists. The current prevalence of the practice is difficult to estimate, but in a 2012 study, approximately 75% of patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes reported self-monitoring at least once daily.
8. Concerns about adapting guidelines to individual patients may explain much of the continued self-monitoring in those with non–insulin-dependent diabetes. For example, in a 2018 qualitative study based on structured interviews with 17 physicians, participants emphasized the role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in supporting patient commitment to the lifestyle changes needed for improved diabetes outcomes.

Physicians may also find helpful a validated tool to test patient confidence in their decision, such as the SURE questionnaire.

### How tightly controlled do fluctuations in blood glucose levels need to be to reduce the risk of developing complications in people with type 1 diabetes? [^6516270e]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2011, the James Lind Alliance published a 'top 10' list of priorities for Type 1 diabetes research based on a structured consultation process. Whether reducing fluctuations in blood glucose can prevent long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications was one of these. In this narrative review, 8 years on, we have assessed the updated evidence for the assertion that increased glucose variability plays an independent and clinically important role in the complications of Type 1 diabetes, over and above mean blood glucose and the effects of hypoglycaemia: the 'glucose variability hypothesis'. Although studies in cultured cells and ex vivo vessels have been suggestive, most studies in Type 1 diabetes have been small and/or cross-sectional, and based on 'finger-prick' glucose measurements that capture glucose variability only in waking hours and are affected by missing data. A recent analysis of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that formally imputed missing data found no independent effect of short-term glucose variability on long-term complications. Few other high-quality longitudinal studies have directly addressed the glucose variability hypothesis in Type 1 diabetes. We conclude that there is little substantial evidence to date to support this hypothesis in Type 1 diabetes, although increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring provides an opportunity to test it more definitively. In the meantime, we recommend that control of glycaemia in Type 1 diabetes should continue to focus on the sustained achievement of target HbA 1c and avoidance of hypoglycaemia.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: diabetes technologies: glucose monitoring [^31d686f1]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Regular self‐monitoring of glucose (using accurate fingerstick blood glucose [BG] measurements, real‐time continuous glucose monitoring [rtCGM] or intermittently scanned CGM [isCGM]), is essential for diabetes management for all children and adolescents with diabetes. A Each child should have access to technology and materials for self‐monitoring of glucose levels and sufficient supplies to optimize diabetes care. B When fingerstick BGs are used, testing may need to be performed 6 to 10 times per day to optimize glycemia. B Frequency of BG testing correlates with improved HbA1c levels and reduced acute complications. B Regular review of glucose values should be performed to inform adjustments to medication/nutritional therapies to optimize glycemia. B Diabetes center personnel should advocate to nations, states, and health care funders to ensure that children and adolescents with diabetes have adequate glucose monitoring supplies. E
Providers should be aware of the differences in accuracy among BG meters — only meters that achieve international accuracy standards (ISO 15197:2013 or are FDA‐approved) should be used. E
Use of CGM is strongly recommended in all children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A
Where available, CGM should be initiated in all children, adolescents, and young adults with T1D as soon as possible after diagnosis to improve glycemic outcomes. B
isCGM, also known as flash glucose monitoring, in the pediatric population is safe, may improve time in range (TIR) and HbA1c levels, decreases time in hypoglycemia, and lowers glycemic variability. B
For isCGM, higher scanning frequency (11–13 scans/per day) is associated with more favorable glycemic markers (HbA1c and TIR). B
rtCGM can be effectively used to lower HbA1c levels, reach target HbA1c level, reduce glucose variability (for insulin pumps, closed‐loop systems, and multiple daily injections [MDI]), increase TIR, reduce mild to moderate hypoglycemia and shorten time spent in hypoglycemia in the pediatric population with T1D. A
rtCGM data can particularly benefit children who cannot articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and those with hypoglycemic unawareness. A
The effectiveness of rtCGM in children and adolescents with T1D is related to the amount of time the sensor is used. A
Prior to CGM start, portray the use of diabetes devices and technologies as an option that can be a good fit for many youth and families; provide education and encourage youth and families to review vetted websites and device informational materials. E
Structured initial and ongoing education and training in CGM use (including data review) is paramount to successful adoption and continued use of this technology. E
Setting realistic expectations for the integration of diabetes technologies is paramount to ensure the success of persons and caregivers adopting new technologies. B
It is critical to counsel youth/families and identify potential barriers to adoption of new technologies or continued use of devices. Validated person‐reported outcome measures can help to identify barriers. B

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: it is time to face the evidence [^b0ddd878]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The evidence for potentially beneficial SMBG-induced effects on glycemic control, hypoglycemic periods, and potential harms in type 2 diabetic patients who are not treated with insulin does not justify the use of SMBG. Moreover, the use of SMBG is associated with huge costs, which should better be redirected toward effective strategies to improve health for this category of patients.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose as part of the integral care of type 2 diabetes [^4d45e55b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Results from landmark diabetes studies have established A1C as the gold standard for assessing long-term glycemic control. However, A1C does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Real-time information provided by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) represents an important adjunct to A1C, because it can differentiate fasting, preprandial, and postprandial hyperglycemia; detect glycemic excursions; identify hypoglycemia; and provide immediate feedback about the effect of food choices, physical activity, and medication on glycemic control. The importance of SMBG is widely appreciated and recommended as a core component of management in patients with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, as well as in diabetic pregnancy, for both women with pregestational type 1 and gestational diabetes. Nevertheless, SMBG in management of non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients continues to be debated. Results from clinical trials are inconclusive, and reviews fail to reach an agreement, mainly because of methodological problems. Carefully designed large-scale studies on diverse patient populations with type 2 diabetes with the follow-up period to investigate long-term effects of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes should be carried out to clarify how to make the best use of SMBG, in which patients, and under what conditions.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and glycemic control: the Northern California kaiser permanente diabetes registry [^9c6388d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of self-monitoring blood glucose levels to improve glycemic control.

Subjects and Methods

A cohort design was used to assess the relation between self-monitoring frequency (1996 average daily glucometer strip utilization) and the first glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level measured in 1997. The study sample included 24,312 adult patients with diabetes who were members of a large, group model, managed care organization. We estimated the difference between HbA1c levels in patients who self-monitored at frequencies recommended by the American Diabetes Association compared with those who monitored less frequently or not at all. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, occupation, income, duration of diabetes, medication refill adherence, clinic appointment "no show" rate, annual eye exam attendance, use of nonpharmacological (diet and exercise) diabetes therapy, smoking, alcohol consumption, hospitalization and emergency room visits, and the number of daily insulin injections.

Results

Self-monitoring among patients with type 1 diabetes (≥ 3 times daily) and pharmacologically treated type 2 diabetes (at least daily) was associated with lower HbA1c levels (1.0 percentage points lower in type 1 diabetes and 0.6 points lower in type 2 diabetes) than was less frequent monitoring (P < 0.0001). Although there are no specific recommendations for patients with nonpharmacologically treated type 2 diabetes, those who practiced self-monitoring (at any frequency) had a 0.4 point lower HbA1c level than those not practicing at all (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

More frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels was associated with clinically and statistically better glycemic control regardless of diabetes type or therapy. These findings support the clinical recommendations suggested by the American Diabetes Association.

2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Achieving target glucose levels assessed through CGM, HbA1c, and/or SMBG: Reduces risks of acute and chronic complications of diabetes A Minimizes the detrimental effects of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia on brain development, cognitive function, mood and quality of life B
Target HbA1c for young people with diabetes should be < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) A An HbA1c target of < 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) is recommended for the remission phase or early stage 3 diabetes "honeymoon" period and in populations with access to advanced technology combined with a highly skilled specialized health care professional service adept in diabetes education E HbA1c assessments are recommended every 3 months E
CGM metrics, recorded over a 14‐day period, should have time spent as follows: B > 70% between 3.9 and 10 mmol/L (70–180 mg/dl) < 4%: < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dl) < 1%: < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dl) < 25%: > 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dl) < 5%: > 13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dl) Glycemic variability (coefficient of variation, [%CV]) target ≤ 36%
SMBG should be assessed at least 6 times a day for a person with diabetes taking insulin B
Recommended target glucose values are between 4 and 10 mmol (70–180 mg/dl), with a narrower fasting target range of 4–8 mmol/L (70–144 mg/dl). E
Less stringent HbA1c, CGM, or SMBG targets are only advisable when achieving the standard target is assessed as being detrimental to the overall well‐being of the person with diabetes or their caregivers. Factors to consider when setting a less stringent target include (but are not limited to): access to insulin analogs, advanced insulin delivery technology (for example automated insulin delivery), supplies needed to regularly check capillary blood glucose levels, or CGM needed to safely achieve targets E Underlying significant psychosocial health concerns exacerbated by efforts to achieve target glucose levels E
A multidisciplinary education team should clearly and collectively communicate recommended glycemic targets; sharing the same philosophy and goals and speaking with "one voice" has beneficial effects on glycemic and psychosocial outcomes. B
Individualized care plans are recommended to help a person with diabetes achieve glycemic targets. E
Data collection and between‐center benchmarking can improve the proportion of people with diabetes reaching glycemic targets. B
Addressing social determinants of health, and improving access to the healthcare team, insulin, and technologies increases the proportion of people reaching glycemic targets. A

### The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in glucagon-like peptide-1-based treatment approaches: a European expert recommendation [^b4e4f2e2]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-based treatment approaches for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing. Although self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been performed in numerous studies on GLP-1 analogs and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, the potential role of SMBG in GLP-1-based treatment strategies has not been elaborated. The expert recommendation suggests individualized SMBG strategies in GLP-1-based treatment approaches and suggests simple and clinically applicable SMBG schemes. Potential benefits of SMBG in GLP-1-based treatment approaches are early assessment of treatment success or failure, timely modification of treatment, detection of hypoglycemic episodes, assessment of glucose excursions, and support of diabetes management and diabetes education. Its length and frequency should depend on the clinical setting and the quality of metabolic control. It is considered to play an important role for the optimization of diabetes management in T2DM patients treated with GLP-1-based approaches.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose as part of the integral care of type 2 diabetes [^df35bdf2]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In pursuit of achieving near-euglycemia while avoiding hypoglycemia, the importance of SMBG is widely appreciated and recommended as a routine part of management in patients with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, as well as in diabetic pregnancy, for both women with pregestational type 1 and gestational diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, it was clearly shown that SMBG in the context of multifactorial interventions is linearly correlated with reductions in A1C. Most authorities recommend subjects with type 1 diabetes using multiple insulin injections or insulin pump therapy to perform more than three capillary glucose determinations per day, but ideally four to six.

In patients with type 2 diabetes managed with noninsulin therapies or medical nutrition therapy, despite the lack of clear evidence linking SMBG to improved glycemic control, the adoption of this practice is quite common and constantly increasing. National guidelines unanimously recommend SMBG in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes; however, there is a lack of consensus on the value of SMBG in non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (NIT-DM) patients. Considering the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes and the tremendous economic burden of the disease both in direct and indirect costs, but also the not neglectable cost of the supplies for performing SMBG, such a gap of a straightforward recommendation regarding SMBG applicability and the optimal frequency of measurements is at least query worthy.

This work focuses on the evidence from clinical trials regarding the impact of SMBG on the metabolic control and on diabetes-related morbidity and mortality for NIT-DM subjects. Attention is given to the question if there is evidence from the performed studies that SMBG produces a differential effect in a subpopulation of type 2 diabetic subjects, on the frequency and timing of SMBG. It reviews the current recommendations for use of SMBG in NIT-DM patients. Also reviewed are the available data about the cost and the cost-effectiveness of this practice. A general discussion of controversies is following.

### Adherence to glycemic monitoring in diabetes [^56fa8c68]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Glucose monitoring either by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) plays an important role in diabetes management and in reducing risk for diabetes-related complications. However, despite evidence supporting the role of glucose monitoring in better patient health outcomes, studies also reveal relatively poor adherence rates to SMBG and CGM use and numerous patient-reported barriers. Fortunately, some promising intervention strategies have been identified that promote at least short-term improvements in patients' adherence to SMBG. These include education, problem solving, contingency management, goal setting, cognitive behavioral therapy, and motivational interviewing. Specific to CGM, interventions to promote greater use among patients are currently under way, yet one pilot study provides data suggesting better maintenance of CGM use in patients showing greater readiness for behavior change. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature specific to glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes focusing specifically on current adherence rates, barriers to monitoring, and promising intervention strategies that may be ready to deploy now in the clinic setting to promote greater patient adherence to glucose monitoring. Yet, to continue to help patients with diabetes adhere to glucose monitoring, future research is needed to identify the treatment strategies and the intervention schedules that most likely lead to long-term maintenance of optimal glycemic monitoring levels.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetic patients: it is time to face the evidence [^ac7b6ab9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

SMBG and hypoglycemia

Periods of hypoglycemia are distressing events that mostly occur with tight glycemic regimens and treatments increasing insulin levels independently of blood glucose levels. It is therefore not surprising that the frequency of hypoglycemia is relatively low in diabetic patients not treated with insulin or oral antidiabetic treatments likely to cause hypoglycemia (e.g. sulfonylurea). SMBG's potential to confirm or refute periods of hypoglycemia has generally been taken up in most management programs targeted at identifying and reducing periods of hypoglycemia, even though its effectiveness in patients using insulin has been tested in a limited number of studies. In noninsulin-treated diabetes, six trials investigated SMBG-related hypoglycemia. In only one study was the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic episodes observed. The three studies that reported hypoglycemia found only an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia with mild symptoms. Given the low risk patients treated with oral antidiabetic drugs have for severe hypoglycemia, especially when the drugs are used as monotherapy or in combination, SMBG would not be required for detection of hypoglycemia in these patients.

### The financial impact of inaccurate blood glucose monitoring systems [^e8b1ab5c]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

Patient blood glucose monitoring (BGM) is considered a key component of diabetes management. When utilized within a structured testing regimen, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provides information about patients' current glycemic status and the ability to obtain immediate feedback regarding the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on glucose levels. However, because both clinicians and patients utilize SMBG data to make critical decisions regarding diabetes medication adjustments, it is crucial that glucose results are accurate.

Inaccurate glucose information can result in severe and even deadly consequences. Whereas erroneously low blood glucose results can lead to extended hyperglycemia, resulting in elevated HbA1c levels and long-term adverse outcomes, erroneously high blood glucose results can lead to severe hypoglycemia, either by failing to detect hypoglycemia or by prompting the user to over-correct with insulin.

Use of inaccurate BGM systems has both clinical and economic consequences. Data from the T1D Exchange registry show that 11.8% of individuals reported having severe hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure in the past year; severe hypoglycemia occurred in almost 1 in 5 older individuals (≥ 60 years) with long-standing (≥ 20 years) diabetes. A more recent report found a self-reported rate of severe hypoglycemia (defined as hypoglycemia resulting in seizure, loss of consciousness, or requiring third-party assistance due to weakness or confusion) of 31% in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the prior year.

It is well recognized that the risk of severe or fatal hypoglycemia notably increases with age in elderly individuals with diabetes who are treated with insulinotropic medications. - It has also been demonstrated that frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to hypoglycemia unawareness, worsening with age and duration of diabetes; individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness have a 6-fold increased risk for severe hypoglycemia. Moreover, frequent severe hypoglycemic events (SHE) can lead to fear, which can become a key obstacle to intensifying therapy and/or adhering to prescribed insulin regimens, resulting in poor metabolic control and subsequent health outcomes.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose as an integral part in the management of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^174895b7]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Local Aspects/Experience

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease affecting people around the world. However, new technologies and medications for diabetes therapy are often initially introduced in high-income countries, and PwD in other parts of the world often have to overcome hurdles regarding access to such diagnostic and therapeutic options. This subject is discussed in the following sections.

China

In 2021, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that 140 million adults in China were living with diabetes, accounting for over one-fourth of the entire world's population of PwD. Among all countries for which data are available, China has the highest number of adults with diabetes, and it is anticipated that it will remain in this position until at least 2045. Applying the diagnostic criteria for diabetes suggested by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the data from two national representative epidemiological surveys in China showed that the prevalence of diabetes regardless of type went up from 10.9% in 2013 to 13.2% in 2020.

A guideline for SMBG was issued by the Chinese Diabetes Society in 2011 and updated 4 years later with the aim to enhance awareness and the standard of practice. SMBG is recognized as an essential component of disease management by helping PwD to better understand their disease, controlling the disease status, and supporting HCPs in their treatment adjustments. Specific monitoring regimen and frequency of SMBG are recommended for subgroups of people with T2DM, including people on insulin and non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, applying the principle of structured SMBG monitoring.

Interventions

The study comprised 3 stages: a run-in period (3 months), the drug intervention period (6 months) and the stabilization period (2–3 months), and was conducted by an endocrinologist (LVV) and a generalist nurse (MFG). Eligible patients underwent an interview, clinical examination and laboratory workup (glucose, HbA 1c [HPLC], lipid profile, liver function tests, creatinine and spot urine albumin). Lifestyle modification advice was provided in a 1-hour appointment during the first study visit, and a folder containing a diet plan and recommendation of at least 150 minutes of physical exercise per week was given to each patient. During the run-in period, patients received a glucose monitoring device and test strips and given guidance on how to use the device and record measurement results. Patients were asked to carry out fasting blood glucose monitoring (before breakfast), but only three times per week due to economic constraints. Patients returned to the primary care clinic for monthly follow-up and reminders of dietary guidance and the importance of exercise and adherence to current medications. During the intervention period, participants visited the clinic once monthly for weight and blood pressure checks and review of the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). The goal was to achieve fasting capillary blood glucose levels (as measured by SMBG) in the range of 90 to 130 mg/dL. If mean SMGB values were higher than 130 mg/dL, medications were added in the following sequence: metformin; glibenclamide; and NPH insulin, initially at bedtime and, if goals were still not met, before breakfast as well, according to the 2006 Diabetes Treatment Algorithm. Medications were started at the lowest manufacturer-recommended dose and doses were increased to the maximum tolerated level at monthly intervals, as guided by SMBG. Another class of glucose-lowering medication was added after the maximum dose was reached. HbA 1c was measured every 3 to 4 months for further adjustment of diabetes medications. The last 2–3 months of the study (stabilization period) were used to observe whether participants' HbA 1c levels had stabilized after the treatment modifications performed during the intervention period. Throughout the study period, patients received standard medical care at the primary care clinic for any adverse events or other concomitant illnesses.

The study endpoints were change in HbA 1c after the intervention and the proportion of patients achieving and/or maintaining an HbA 1c of < 7% during 1-year follow-up.

### Consensus report: the current role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes [^c62200d2]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

The Coalition for Clinical Research — Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Scientific Board convened a meeting in San Francisco, CA, July 20–21, 2011, to discuss the current practice of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in non-insulin-treated (NIT) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Twelve physician panel members from academia, practice, and government attended this meeting. These experts came from the United States, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In addition, three consultants from Australia, Germany, and the United States contributed to the group's final report. This coalition was organized by Diabetes Technology Society. Self-monitoring of blood glucose was studied from eight perspectives related to patients with NIT T2DM: (1) epidemiological studies; (2) randomized controlled trials (RCT)s and meta-analyses; (3) targets, timing, and frequency of SMBG use; (4) incidence and role of SMBG in preventing hypoglycemia with single-drug regimens and combination regimens consisting of antihyperglycemic agents other than secretagogues and insulin; (5) comparison of SMBG with continuous glucose monitoring; (6) technological capabilities and limitations of SMBG; (7) barriers to appropriate use of SMBG; and (8) methods and end points for appropriate future clinical trials. The panel emphasized recent studies, which reflect the current approach for applying this intervention. Among the participants there was consensus that: SMBG is an established practice for patients with NIT T2DM, and to be most effective, it should be performed in a structured format where information obtained from this measurement is used to guide treatment; New, high-quality efficacy data from RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of SMBG in NIT T2DM in trials reported since 2008; Both patients and health care professionals require education on how to respond to the data for SMBG to be effective; and Additional well-defined studies are needed to assess the benefits and costs of SMBG with end points not limited to hemoglobin A1c.

### Effect of structured self-monitoring of blood glucose, with and without additional teleCare support, on overall glycaemic control in non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes: the SMBG study, a 12-month randomized controlled trial [^8e1b0722]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

What's new?

This 12‐month randomized controlled trial examined the impact of structured self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), with and without TeleCare support, on glycaemic control in people with sub‐optimally controlled Type 2 diabetes.
Results showed that this standardized, structured SMBG intervention, with or without additional TeleCare, provided statistically and clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control.
Structured SMBG should be offered as part of the self‐management process for all people with sub‐optimally controlled Type 2 diabetes, even when not treated with insulin. Unstructured SMBG (other than for safety purposes) should be regarded as a waste of valuable time and resources.

### Is self-monitoring of blood glucose appropriate for all type 2 diabetic patients? The fremantle diabetes study [^1e5c8b85]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is associated with better glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We used cross-sectional and longitudinal data from type 2 diabetic participants in the observational, community-based Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS) who reported SMBG status at study entry (n = 1,286) and annual reviews over 5 years (n = 531).

Results

At study entry, 70% of patients performed SMBG, with a median of four tests per week (interquartile range two to seven). Patients with shorter diabetes duration; who were attending diabetes education, diabetes-related clinics, or medical specialists; who were taking insulin with or without oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs); and who were self-reporting hypoglycemic events were more likely to use SMBG. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal FDS data showed that HbA(1c) (A1C) was not significantly different between SMBG users and nonusers, either overall or within diabetes treatment groups (diet, OHAs, and insulin with or without OHAs). There was also no independent cross-sectional relationship between A1C and SMBG frequency. The average annual societal cost of using SMBG (in year 2000 Australian dollars [Adollars], excluding glucometers) was 162 Australian dollars per type 2 diabetic patient or 51 million Australian dollars when projected to the Australian diagnosed type 2 diabetic population.

Conclusions

Neither SMBG testing nor its frequency was associated with glycemic benefit in type 2 diabetic patients regardless of treatment. Our data did not include methods of SMBG delivery and application, factors that require further assessment in the evaluation of SMBG utility in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. SMBG may be still of value in the identification and prevention of hypoglycemia and in dose adjustment in insulin-treated patients.

### The importance of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients [^8d0cf105]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

In addition, blood glucose monitoring (BGM), using any of the widely available self- monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) or interstitial glucose sampling using continuous glucose monitors (CGM); is an important part of management of diabetes; especially for people who experience hypoglycemic episodes. BGM provides an immediate evaluation of blood glucose levels; information that can be used to guide the therapy and to detect the hypoglycemia, and offers important feedback both to patients and to the health cares about glycemic control and patient treatment satisfaction. CGM may be particularly important for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or patients experiencing frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.

It is important that in patients with a history of recurrent hypoglycemia, the time of episodes be identified and the treatment regimen be adjusted accordingly. With a basal-bolus insulin regimen, morning fasting hypoglycemia may be caused by the long- or intermediate- acting insulin; daytime hypoglycemia is implicated by rapid or short acting insulin; and nocturnal hypoglycemia may be implicated by either. Substitution of short-acting (regular) insulin with rapid-acting insulin (e.g. lispro or aspart) reduces frequency of daytime hypoglycemia. Substitution of long-acting (e.g. glargine or determir) insulin for intermediate- acting insulin (e.g. NPH or premix 70/30) reduces frequency of nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a rapid-acting insulin analog improves the glycemic control and reduces the rate of hypoglycemia compared with multiple daily insulin injection.

Patients on oral anti-diabetic drugs are also at risk for developing hypoglycemia. Agents such as metformine, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidines are preferable to sulfonylureas in minimizing hypoglycemic risks.

Glycemic goals should be individualized with some degree of safety particularly for patients with long duration of diabetes; patients who have a high risk of severe hypoglycemia development, and/or subjects with multiple co-morbidities. Individualized treatment should be determined by a close working relationship between diabetes care team and the patients. The health care professionals may improve patient knowledge and produce positive changes in life style and self-care decisions. The diabetes care team involvement not only provides the initial patient's guidance, but also monitors the short and long term complications for early detection and management.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose in pregnancy — "Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is assumed to be important to achieve euglycemia without significant hypoglycemia during pregnancy", yet "no particular approach to blood glucose monitoring has been demonstrated to be superior to any other". A common approach is checking "in the fasting state, 1 or 2 hours after each meal, and before bed", with premeal assessment if dosing is based on premeal values. Blood glucose meters "indicate plasma glucose levels"; fasting values "reflect the action of overnight basal insulin", before-meal values "indicate daytime basal insulin activity", and post-meal levels "reveal the effect of the meal and recent insulin doses". In selected patients, especially those on insulin pumps, testing "at 2–3 AM may help detect nocturnal hypoglycemia"; nocturnal hypoglycemia "is caused by excessive basal insulin or an inadequate bedtime snack", whereas nocturnal hyperglycemia "may be due to insufficient basal insulin or pump failure". Continuous glucose monitors "are used to assess glucose control" and "measure the glucose content of interstitial fluid through a needle".

Parenteral nutrition (PN) monitoring — glucose, vascular access device (VAD), micronutrients, and therapy reassessment — includes blood glucose checks every 1–24 h as warranted by clinical status, discontinued once blood glucose values normalize and PN reaches target dextrose dose. Examination of the VAD is by daily assessment; x-ray confirmation at VAD placement, when admitted with a VAD in place, whenever concern for catheter displacement exists. Evaluation of micronutrient status is performed when history, physical, and/or clinical evidence suggests an abnormality. The need for PN therapy is reassessed daily; or with signs indicating return of improvement in bowel function or with change in pertinent clinical condition, and general response to therapy is followed ongoing throughout the course of therapy.

### Continuous glucose monitoring systems for type 1 diabetes mellitus [^0b4d72dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is essential to optimise glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide semi-continuous information about glucose levels, which identifies fluctuations that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Two types of CGM systems can be defined: retrospective systems and real-time systems. Real-time systems continuously provide the actual glucose concentration on a display. Currently, the use of CGM is not common practice and its reimbursement status is a point of debate in many countries.

Objectives

To assess the effects of CGM systems compared to conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for the identification of studies. Last search date was June 8, 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing retrospective or real-time CGM with conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose levels or with another type of CGM system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control, e.g. level of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse events and complications, CGM derived glycaemic control, death and costs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias and performed data-extraction. Although there was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies an exploratory meta-analysis was performed on those outcomes the authors felt could be pooled without losing clinical merit.

Main Results

The search identified 1366 references. Twenty-two RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria of this review were identified. The results of the meta-analyses (across all age groups) indicate benefit of CGM for patients starting on CGM sensor augmented insulin pump therapy compared to patients using multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) and standard monitoring blood glucose (SMBG). After six months there was a significant larger decline in HbA1c level for real-time CGM users starting insulin pump therapy compared to patients using MDI and SMBG (mean difference (MD) in change in HbA1c level -0.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8% to -0.5%, 2 RCTs, 562 patients, I(2) = 84%). The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased for CGM users, but CIs were wide and included unity (4/43 versus 1/35; RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 27.82 and 21/247 versus 17/248; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29). One study reported the occurrence of ketoacidosis from baseline to six months; there was however only one event. Both RCTs were in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. For patients starting with CGM only, the average decline in HbA1c level six months after baseline was also statistically significantly larger for CGM users compared to SMBG users, but much smaller than for patients starting using an insulin pump and CGM at the same time (MD change in HbA1c level -0.2%, 95% CI -0.4% to -0.1%, 6 RCTs, 963 patients, I(2) = 55%). On average, there was no significant difference in risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis between CGM and SMBG users. The confidence interval however, was wide and included a decreased as well as an increased risk for CGM users compared to the control group (severe hypoglycaemia: 36/411 versus 33/407; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62, 4 RCTs, I(2) = 0% and ketoacidosis: 8/411 versus 8/407; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.40, 4 RCTs, I(2) = 0%). Health-related quality of life was reported in five of the 22 studies. In none of these studies a significant difference between CGM and SMBG was found. Diabetes complications, death and costs were not measured. There were no studies in pregnant women with diabetes type 1 and in patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in children, adults and patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The largest improvements in glycaemic control were seen for sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in patients with poorly controlled diabetes who had not used an insulin pump before. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not significantly increased for CGM users, but as these events occurred infrequent these results have to be interpreted cautiously. There are indications that higher compliance of wearing the CGM device improves glycosylated haemoglobin A1c level (HbA1c) to a larger extent.

SMBG continues to be necessary to validate or confirm CGM values; for example, when symptoms do not match sensor glucose values and during the sensor warm-up period. Therefore, patients using CGM must continue to have access to SMBG.

2. Glucose meters

a. There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening. C (moderate)

b. The imprecision of the results, coupled with the substantial differences among meters, precludes the use of glucose meters from the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening for diabetes. A (moderate)

c. SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. A (high)

d. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. Data are insufficient, however, to claim an associated improvement of health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not known. C (high)

e. Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and concurrent laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands. B (moderate)

f. Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed. These targets vary widely and are highly controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of current meters, with an intermediate goal of limiting total error for 95% of samples to ≤ 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to < 0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Lower total error would be desirable and may prove necessary in tight glucose-control protocols and for avoiding hypoglycemia in all settings. C (low)

g. Meters should measure and report plasma glucose concentrations to facilitate comparison with assays performed in accredited laboratories. GPP

h. Studies are needed to determine the analytical goals (quality specifications) for glucose meters in SMBG and in intensive care units. C (moderate)

i. Recommendations for future research: Important end points in studies of SMBG should include, at a minimum, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes to ascertain whether improved meters enable patients to achieve better glucose control. For studies of meter use in intensive or critical care, important end points include mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemia, and variation of glucose control. Ideally, outcomes (e.g. long-term complications) should also be examined. GPP
