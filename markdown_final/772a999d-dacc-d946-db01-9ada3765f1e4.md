## Question

A 68-year-old male visits his primary care physician after an episode of syncope during a tennis match. He reports exertional dyspnea with mild substernal chest pain. On physical exam a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur is heard best at the right 2nd intercostal space. This murmur was not heard at the patient's last appointment six months ago. Which of the following would most support a diagnosis of aortic stenosis?

Answer Choices:
A. Presence of S3
B. Murmur radiates to carotid arteries bilaterally
C. Murmur radiates to axilla
D. Asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which physical finding would most support a diagnosis of aortic stenosis in a 68-year-old man with exertional syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and a new systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic bedside features of aortic stenosis and how they differ from mimics. Then, I should verify the radiation pattern of the murmur and why it matters. Next, I will examine each option against pathophysiology and common differentials. Finally, I will confirm the single best answer and note any exceptions or confounders that could mislead us.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. A harsh systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border (aortic area) in an older adult with exertional symptoms and syncope is highly suggestive of calcific aortic stenosis, and the new onset over six months fits progression typical of degenerative valve disease. I should double-check that this location and quality align with aortic stenosis, which they do, and that exertional syncope is a red flag for hemodynamically significant AS, which it is per syncope guidelines and valvular heart disease guidance [^2430db72] [^4fbdf7c2].

> Now, I need to check the radiation pattern that is most specific for aortic stenosis. The murmur of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotid arteries bilaterally because the turbulent jet tracks into the ascending aorta and then the carotids, producing a transmitted thrill or delayed carotid upstroke. Wait, let me verify that this is taught as a distinguishing feature at the bedside; yes, bilateral carotid radiation is a hallmark that helps separate AS from other systolic murmurs and is consistently emphasized in teaching and exam frameworks, even if the provided documents do not explicitly state it word-for-word [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option A, S3. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: S3 is a soft, early diastolic sound that reflects increased ventricular filling pressures and is not a feature of isolated aortic stenosis. In fact, S3 is more characteristic of heart failure or volume overload states, and while a failing left ventricle from longstanding severe AS could eventually manifest an S3, it is not a supportive sign for diagnosing AS itself and would argue against a purely valvular outflow obstruction picture in this context [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option B, murmur radiating to the carotids bilaterally. As I just confirmed, this radiation pattern is classic for aortic stenosis and reflects the anatomic pathway of the stenotic jet. Let me consider whether any of the alternatives match this specificity; none do, and this radiation pattern is particularly helpful to distinguish AS from mitral regurgitation, which radiates to the axilla, and from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which has a different location and dynamic behavior. Therefore, this is the most supportive finding here [^notfound].

> Option C claims radiation to the axilla. Wait, I should verify the typical radiation of mitral regurgitation: yes, MR classically radiates to the axilla and back, not to the carotids, so this pattern would argue against aortic stenosis and point toward MR instead. Thus, this choice is incorrect for supporting AS in this scenario [^notfound].

> Option D proposes asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy. Hold on, I should verify the hypertrophy pattern in AS versus HCM. In aortic stenosis, the hypertrophy is typically concentric left ventricular hypertrophy from chronic pressure overload, not asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy is the hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can also cause exertional syncope but produces a different murmur dynamic and location. So asymmetric hypertrophy would steer me toward HCM rather than AS, making this option misleading for confirming AS here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most supportive bedside finding for aortic stenosis in this presentation is bilateral carotid radiation of the systolic murmur, which aligns with the murmur's origin and propagation in calcific AS. I should confirm that this choice is consistent with the vignette's location and quality, and it is. Therefore, the correct answer is B, with the other options either nonspecific or pointing to alternative diagnoses [^notfound].

---

The best answer is **B. Murmur radiates to carotid arteries bilaterally**. This is a hallmark of aortic stenosis because the turbulent jet from the stenotic valve propagates into the ascending aorta and carotids, producing a harsh crescendo–decrescendo murmur with a delayed, diminished carotid pulse (pulsus tardus et parvus). The other options are less specific: S3 suggests heart failure rather than valvular obstruction, axillary radiation is typical of mitral regurgitation, and asymmetric hypertrophy indicates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not aortic stenosis.

---

## Clinical significance of murmur radiation

Murmur radiation reflects the **path of turbulent blood flow** from the affected valve. In aortic stenosis, the stenotic jet flows into the ascending aorta and then the carotid arteries, so the murmur characteristically radiates to both carotids. This radiation pattern is highly specific for aortic stenosis and helps distinguish it from other systolic murmurs.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Clinical significance** | **Relevance to aortic stenosis** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Presence of S3 | S3 is a third heart sound associated with increased ventricular filling pressures and heart failure; it is not specific to aortic stenosis | Not specific to aortic stenosis |
| B. Murmur radiates to carotid arteries bilaterally | Classic for aortic stenosis; reflects turbulent flow into the carotids | Highly specific for aortic stenosis |
| C. Murmur radiates to axilla | Typical of mitral regurgitation, not aortic stenosis | Incorrect for aortic stenosis |
| D. Asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy | Suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not aortic stenosis | Incorrect for aortic stenosis |

---

## Pathophysiological basis of carotid radiation in aortic stenosis

In aortic stenosis, the narrowed valve creates a high-velocity jet that causes turbulence and vibration of the aortic wall and surrounding structures. These vibrations propagate into the **ascending aorta and carotid arteries**, producing the characteristic carotid radiation of the murmur.

---

## Clinical implications of carotid radiation

Carotid radiation of the murmur is a **highly specific** finding for aortic stenosis and helps differentiate it from other causes of systolic murmurs, such as mitral regurgitation or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It also correlates with the severity of aortic stenosis, as more severe stenosis produces a louder murmur with more pronounced radiation.

---

## Conclusion

The murmur of aortic stenosis is best distinguished by its **radiation to both carotid arteries**, reflecting the turbulent jet into the ascending aorta. This is the most supportive physical finding for aortic stenosis in this case.

### Interpretation and use of a decision support tool for multiple treatment options: a combined randomised controlled trial and survey of medical students [^79e61b4b]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To investigate medical students’ ability to interpret evidence, as well as their self-assessed understandability, perceived usefulness and preferences for design alternatives in an interactive decision support tool, displaying GRADE evidence summaries for multiple treatment options (Making Alternative Treatment CHoices Intuitive and Trustworthy, MATCH-IT).

Design

A combined randomised controlled trial and survey. Participants were presented with a clinical scenario and randomised to one of two versions of the MATCH-IT tool (A/B), instructed to explore the evidence and decide on a recommendation. Participants answered a questionnaire assessing interpretation, treatment recommendation self-assessed understandability and perceived usefulness before exposure to the other MATCH-IT version and asked questions on design preferences.

Setting

Online lecture in an evidence-based medicine (EBM) introductory course.

Participants

149 third-year medical students. 52% (n=77) had 6 months of clinical training and 48% (n=72) had preclinical training only.

Interventions

The MATCH-IT tool version A uses colour coding to categorise interventions by magnitude and direction of effects and displays all outcomes in a table on entry. Version B has no colour coding, and the user must decide which outcomes to display in the table.

Main outcome measures

Interpretation of evidence, treatment recommendation, perceived usefulness and understandability, preference for format and design alternatives.

Results

82.5% (n=123) of medical students correctly answered ≥4 out of 5 multiple choice questions assessing interpretation of data. 75.8% (n=114) of students made a treatment recommendation in accordance with an expert panel for the same clinical scenario. 87.2% (n=130) found the tool understandable while 91.9% perceived the tool as useful in addressing the clinical scenario.

Conclusion

Medical students with no prior training in EBM can interpret and use the MATCH-IT tool. Certain design alternatives were preferred but had no bearing on interpretation of evidence or understandability of the tool.

Appendix B—recommendation rating scale defines the levels and their clinician implications as follows: A strong recommendation means benefits clearly exceed harms and evidence quality is excellent; Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A moderate recommendation means benefits exceed harms but evidence is not as strong; Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation indicates suspect evidence or little clear advantage among options; Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation reflects a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8fba03c3]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease—stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

PRS-based medical management—polygenic risk score (PRS)-based medical management should be evidence-based, and there is currently limited evidence to support the use of PRSs to guide medical management; extrapolating from established non-PRS risk management may be prudent in some scenarios and may not be in others, and until robust outcome research is available clinicians using PRS should make efforts to standardize their management approach and, when possible, contribute to efforts that analyze clinical outcomes of prospective PRS-based management, noting that currently there are no clinical guidelines available for the use of PRS.

Adult isthmic spondylolisthesis—symptoms and clinical presentation are that in adult patients with symptomatic isthmic spondylolisthesis, most patients present with low back pain and at least half present radicular lower extremity pain (Grade of Recommendation: B). In a study of 72 patients (34 females and 38 males; average age 40 years old), the condition was located at L4/L5 in 14% and L5/S1 in 86%, with Meyerding grades distributed as Grade I 65%, Grade II 33%, and Grade III 2%. Patients were separated into Group 1 (n=35; back and lower limb pain present for a mean of 10 years) and Group 2 (n=37; symptomatic within a mean of 3 years). Across groups, radiating lower limb pain types were radicular 53%, pseudoradicular 21%, and combined 14%; neurological examination showed radicular symptoms in 40% of Group 1 and 70% of Group 2; radicular symptoms were predominant 46% in Grade I. The L4/L5 level was more frequently associated with radicular signs than L5/S1 (70% vs 50%), intra-operative root compression was found in 36 patients, and radicular symptoms were unilateral 55% and absent 13%.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^8813691b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in decisions that involve weighing benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of decision aids for people facing treatment or screening decisions.

Search Strategy

For this update, we searched from January 2006 to December 2009 in MEDLINE (Ovid); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, issue 4 2009); CINAHL (Ovid) (to September 2008 only); EMBASE (Ovid); PsycINFO (Ovid); and grey literature. Cumulatively, we have searched each database since its start date.

Selection Criteria

We included published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of decision aids, which are interventions designed to support patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to usual care and/or alternative interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed potential risk of bias. The primary outcomes, based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, were:A) decision attributes;B) decision making process attributes.Secondary outcomes were behavioral, health, and health system effects. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR), applying a random effects model.

Main Results

Of 34,316 unique citations, 86 studies involving 20,209 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included. Thirty-one of these studies are new in this update. Twenty-nine trials are ongoing. There was variability in potential risk of bias across studies. The two criteria that were most problematic were lack of blinding and the potential for selective outcome reporting, given that most of the earlier trials were not registered.Of 86 included studies, 63 (73%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: A) criteria involving decision attributes: knowledge scores (51 studies); accurate risk perceptions (16 studies); and informed value-based choice (12 studies); and B) criteria involving decision process attributes: feeling informed (30 studies) and feeling clear about values (18 studies).A) Criteria involving decision attributes:Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions by increasing knowledge (MD 13.77 out of 100; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.40 to 16.15; n = 26). When more detailed decision aids were compared to simpler decision aids, the relative improvement in knowledge was significant (MD 4.97 out of 100; 95% CI 3.22 to 6.72; n = 15). Exposure to a decision aid with expressed probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.08; n = 14). The effect was stronger when probabilities were expressed in numbers (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.37; n = 11) rather than words (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.48; n = 3). Exposure to a decision aid with explicit values clarification compared to those without explicit values clarification resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving decisions that were informed and consistent with their values (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52; n = 8).B) Criteria involving decision process attributes:Decision aids compared to usual care interventions resulted in: a) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -6.43 of 100; 95% CI -9.16 to -3.70; n = 17); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -4.81; 95% CI -7.23 to -2.40; n = 14); c) reduced the proportions of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; n = 11); and d) reduced proportions of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74; n = 9). Decision aids appear to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication in the four studies that measured this outcome. For satisfaction with the decision (n = 12) and/or the decision making process (n = 12), those exposed to a decision aid were either more satisfied or there was no difference between the decision aid versus comparison interventions. There were no studies evaluating the decision process attributes relating to helping patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made or understand that values affect the choice.C) Secondary outcomesExposure to decision aids compared to usual care continued to demonstrate reduced choice of: major elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00; n = 11). Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care also resulted in reduced choice of PSA screening (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; n = 7). When detailed compared to simple decision aids were used, there was reduced choice of menopausal hormones (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; n = 3). For other decisions, the effect on choices was variable. The effect of decision aids on length of consultation varied from -8 minutes to +23 minutes (median 2.5 minutes). Decision aids do not appear to be different from comparisons in terms of anxiety (n = 20), and general health outcomes (n = 7), and condition specific health outcomes (n = 9). The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (adherence to the decision, costs/resource use) were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

New for this updated review is evidence that: decision aids with explicit values clarification exercises improve informed values-based choices; decision aids appear to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication; and decision aids have a variable effect on length of consultation.Consistent with findings from the previous review, which had included studies up to 2006: decision aids increase people's involvement, and improve knowledge and realistic perception of outcomes; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on choices. They reduce the choice of discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The effects on adherence with the chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, cost-effectiveness, and use with developing and/or lower literacy populations need further evaluation. Little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have positive effects on attributes of the decision or decision-making process.

### Patient priorities and decision-making process when choosing between colonic investigation alternatives: a qualitative interview study [^08208b32]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Colonic investigation decision-making process

Four themes were identified from interviewees relating to the decision-making process; initial stages in the decision-making process, test information provided to the patient, perceived test information that should be provided and improvements suggested by patients for the decision-making process (online supplemental appendix C table 1). Patients described a mixed level of involvement in the colonic investigation decision-making process. Many patients described being guided by medical professionals to reach a decision regarding their colonic investigation:

Yes I was involved [in the decision-making process]. I was. I discussed the symptoms with my GP, Dr [name redacted]. We sort of chatted them over and she was very good. Because I’ve had previous bowel tests, she went away and came back to me after she’d looked at my records really. – Participant K

Other patients suggested they were not involved in this decision-making process at all. Patients did not appear to have a negative view of their lack of involvement, and in later interview sections, patients described the perceived importance of trusting the doctor when making decisions or being guided by them. Patients also said they decided to opt for colonic investigations by wanting to determine the cause of concerning symptoms. Positive experiences were also discussed in relation to consultations with the patients’ general practitioner (GP).

A lack of, and variable quality in the test information from primary and secondary care was voiced by most patients. In primary care, patients described not being given enough detail about tests and the short consultation times experienced:

I think the GP was very much, in terms of the capsule, he certainly didn’t give me a great deal of information about it… I’m not too sure about that question because you have quite a short period of time with the GP – Participant A

Patients discussed a lack of contact from secondary care clinicians in relation to being provided with information about tests also. A minority of patients had different test options discussed, which was consistent with the mixed levels of involvement in the decision-making process as very few patients reported being offered different tests to choose between. As a result, when asked about test information that should be provided, patients were keen to receive more information about different options and the advantages and disadvantages of these tests.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^12d088ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids are intended to help people participate in decisions that involve weighing the benefits and harms of treatment options often with scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To assess the effects of decision aids for people facing treatment or screening decisions.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched from 2009 to June 2012 in MEDLINE; CENTRAL; EMBASE; PsycINFO; and grey literature. Cumulatively, we have searched each database since its start date including CINAHL (to September 2008).

Selection Criteria

We included published randomized controlled trials of decision aids, which are interventions designed to support patients' decision making by making explicit the decision, providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to usual care and/or alternative interventions. We excluded studies of participants making hypothetical decisions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes, based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), were:A) 'choice made' attributes;B) 'decision-making process' attributes.Secondary outcomes were behavioral, health, and health-system effects. We pooled results using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR), applying a random-effects model.

Main Results

This update includes 33 new studies for a total of 115 studies involving 34,444 participants. For risk of bias, selective outcome reporting and blinding of participants and personnel were mostly rated as unclear due to inadequate reporting. Based on 7 items, 8 of 115 studies had high risk of bias for 1 or 2 items each.Of 115 included studies, 88 (76.5%) used at least one of the IPDAS effectiveness criteria: A) 'choice made' attributes criteria: knowledge scores (76 studies); accurate risk perceptions (25 studies); and informed value-based choice (20 studies); and B) 'decision-making process' attributes criteria: feeling informed (34 studies) and feeling clear about values (29 studies).A) Criteria involving 'choice made' attributes:Compared to usual care, decision aids increased knowledge (MD 13.34 out of 100; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.17 to 15.51; n = 42). When more detailed decision aids were compared to simple decision aids, the relative improvement in knowledge was significant (MD 5.52 out of 100; 95% CI 3.90 to 7.15; n = 19). Exposure to a decision aid with expressed probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.16; n = 19). Exposure to a decision aid with explicit values clarification resulted in a higher proportion of patients choosing an option congruent with their values (RR 1.51; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.96; n = 13).B) Criteria involving 'decision-making process' attributes:Decision aids compared to usual care interventions resulted in:a) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -7.26 of 100; 95% CI -9.73 to -4.78; n = 22) and feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.09; 95% CI -8.50 to -3.67; n = 18);b) reduced proportions of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81; n = 14); andc) reduced proportions of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.72; n = 18).Decision aids appeared to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication in all nine studies that measured this outcome. For satisfaction with the decision (n = 20), decision-making process (n = 17), and/or preparation for decision making (n = 3), those exposed to a decision aid were either more satisfied, or there was no difference between the decision aid versus comparison interventions. No studies evaluated decision-making process attributes for helping patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made, or understanding that values affect the choice.C) Secondary outcomes Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care reduced the number of people of choosing major elective invasive surgery in favour of more conservative options (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93; n = 15). Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care reduced the number of people choosing to have prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; n = 9). When detailed compared to simple decision aids were used, fewer people chose menopausal hormone therapy (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; n = 3). For other decisions, the effect on choices was variable.The effect of decision aids on length of consultation varied from 8 minutes shorter to 23 minutes longer (median 2.55 minutes longer) with 2 studies indicating statistically-significantly longer, 1 study shorter, and 6 studies reporting no difference in consultation length. Groups of patients receiving decision aids do not appear to differ from comparison groups in terms of anxiety (n = 30), general health outcomes (n = 11), and condition-specific health outcomes (n = 11). The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (adherence to the decision, costs/resource use) were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that decision aids compared to usual care improve people's knowledge regarding options, and reduce their decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed and unclear about their personal values. There is moderate-quality evidence that decision aids compared to usual care stimulate people to take a more active role in decision making, and improve accurate risk perceptions when probabilities are included in decision aids, compared to not being included. There is low-quality evidence that decision aids improve congruence between the chosen option and the patient's values.New for this updated review is further evidence indicating more informed, values-based choices, and improved patient-practitioner communication. There is a variable effect of decision aids on length of consultation. Consistent with findings from the previous review, decision aids have a variable effect on choices. They reduce the number of people choosing discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The effects on adherence with the chosen option, cost-effectiveness, use with lower literacy populations, and level of detail needed in decision aids need further evaluation. Little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have a positive effect on attributes of the choice made, or the decision-making process.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^7f668c34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in preference-sensitive decisions.

Objectives

1. Create a comprehensive inventory of patient decision aids focused on healthcare options. 2. Review randomized controlled trials (RCT) of decision aids, for people facing healthcare decisions.

Search Strategy

Studies were identified through databases and contact with researchers active in the field.

Selection Criteria

Two independent reviewers screened abstracts for interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes. Information about the decision aids was compiled in an inventory; those that had been evaluated in a RCT were reviewed in detail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. Results of RCTs were pooled using weighted mean differences (WMD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

Main Results

Over 200 decision aids were identified. Of the 131 available decision aids, most are intended for use before counselling. Using the CREDIBLE criteria to evaluate the quality of the decision aids: a) most included potential harms and benefits, credentials of the developers, description of their development process, update policy, and were free of perceived conflict of interest; b) many included reference to relevant literature; c) few included a description of the level of uncertainty regarding the evidence; and d) few were evaluated. Thirty of these decision aids were evaluated in 34 RCTs and another trial evaluated a suite of eight decision aids. An additional 30 trials are yet to be published. Among the trials comparing decision aids to usual care, decision aids performed better in terms of: a) greater knowledge (WMD 19 out of 100, 95% CI: 13 to 24; b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.9); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling informed (WMD -9.1 of 100, 95%CI: -12 to -6); d) increased proportion of people active in decision making (RR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post intervention (RR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.7). When simpler were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in: a) knowledge (WMD 4 out of 100, 95% CI: 3 to 6); b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.7); and c) greater agreement between values and choice. Decision aids appeared to do no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. Decision aids had a variable effect on which healthcare options were selected.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The availability of decision aids is expanding with many on the Internet; however few have been evaluated. Trials indicate that decision aids improve knowledge and realistic expectations; enhance active participation in decision making; lower decisional conflict; decrease the proportion of people remaining undecided, and improve agreement between values and choice. The effects on persistence with chosen therapies and cost-effectiveness require further evaluation. Finally, optimal strategies for dissemination need to be explored.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^364b3e34]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Guideline definitions—strength of evidence-based statements and clinician implications—classify four categories as follows. “A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms … and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B).” For this category, “Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present.” “A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms … but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C).” Its implication is that “Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences.” For “Option,” “either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another,” and “Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making …; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.” For “No recommendation,” “there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms,” and “Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making …; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.”

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^b92fe5d2]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our perspectives are shifting from passive monitoring to active management for the assessment and treatment of those with AS. Insight into the two stages of CAS, initiation and propagation, have proven to be invaluable, providing novel management options. Of particular interest is Lp(a), which can play a multifaceted role in genetic screening, biomarker measurement and targeted treatment. Further studies into cellular pathology are warranted to contextualise current research and identify additional biomarkers, increasing the specificity of a multimarker screening approach. In addition to this, asymptomatic management has the potential to be revolutionised through the use of therapeutics to slow disease progression and CMR to guide early valve replacement. Validation of advanced patient stratification and diagnostic workup could propagate the widespread adoption of personalised AS therapy. Although many pharmacotherapies have exhibited potential, an increase in the number of prospective RCTs, with the larger cohort sizes of retrospective studies, is necessary to validate their clinical efficacy in reducing CAS burden.

Communication models for breaking bad news—examples of models of breaking bad news and communication—include the following structured approaches. Death Disclosure and Delivery of Difficult News in Trauma outlines: A: Anticipate; B: Be aware of self and surroundings; C: Conversation / Concerns; D: Do not speak, LISTEN; E: Empathy / Explain; Debrief and Document. The “Ask-Tell-Ask” model advises: ASK the individual what he/she knows; TELL “bad news” in straightforward language; ASK if the information was understood. The SPIKES model lists: SETTING UP the interview; Assessing the patient’s PERCEPTION; Obtaining the patient’s INVITATION; Giving KNOWLEDGE and information to the patient; Addressing the patient’s EMOTIONS with EMPATHIC responses; STRATEGY and SUMMARY. The ABCDE’s of delivering bad news include: ADVANCE preparation; BUILD a therapeutic environment/relationship; COMMUNICATE well; DEAL with patient and family reactions; ENCOURAGE and validate emotions. The Surgical Palliative Care Resident’s Guide emphasizes: speak slowly, deliberately, and clearly; give fair warning; present bad news in a succinct manner; sit quietly and listen to the patient; anticipate common reactions to bad news; listen carefully and actively; pick up clues; recognize, acknowledge, and validate the patient’s and family’s emotions, reactions, and thoughts; give an early opportunity for questions and comments; present information at the patient’s and family’s pace; be flexible and responsive; be mindful; ask, “How can I help?”; assess for thoughts of self-harm; and agree on a follow-up plan.

### Exertional intolerance and dyspnea with preserved lung function: an emerging long COVID phenotype? [^977f5687]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
Characterizing Patients with Long COVID who had Normal 6-min walk test (6MWT) Distances Versus Those who had Reduced Distances (Total n = 165) by A 6MWT Distance; B Oxygen Saturation Nadir; C Pulmonary Function Testing; D Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Subjective Dyspnea Score; E Post-COVID Functional Scale (PCFS) score; F Health-related Quality of Life (EQ–5D–5L) score

The nadir oxygen saturation observed during the walk test was similar between those with normal versus reduced exertional tolerance (Fig. 1 B). Overall, lung function on average was within expected normal limits and no differences in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 /FVC, total lung capacity (TLC) or diffusion capacity adjusted for alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) between the two groups were noted (Fig. 1 C). Chi 2 analysis of symptoms demonstrated no differences between the two groups with regards to neurologic (p = 0.75), musculoskeletal (p = 0.14) or fatigue (p = 0.17) complaints. Interestingly, subjective mMRC dyspnea score was significantly higher for the reduced exertional tolerance group (Fig. 1 D). These patients also reported more functional impairment, as reflected by a higher Post-COVID Functional Scale (PCFS) score (Fig. 1 E), and a lower health-related quality of life (EQ–5D–5L) score (Fig. 1 F). 69% of patients with normal exertional tolerance reported having returned to work at 3 months post-recovery compared to 62% of patients with reduced exertional tolerance (p = 0.53). Collectively, these observations suggest that the difference in walk distance is associated with significant subjective dyspnea and may have significant ramifications on overall function and quality of life but is unlikely to be due to a pulmonary limitation to exercise or confounding neurologic, musculoskeletal or fatigue symptoms.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation—language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with “should” and “should not” statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by “may” or “need not.” A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Clinician survey regarding measurable residual disease-guided decision-making in multiple myeloma [^1996b5fc]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

For each scenario, respondents reported if and how their answer would be different based on changes in disease risk (i.e. high-risk) or MRD status.

There was a total of 90 respondents who agreed to participate; 89 (99%) completed the core survey, of which 68 (76%) submitted responses to the optional clinical scenarios section. Self-identified academic clinicians made up 76% of respondents (68/89) as opposed to a private practice or hybrid setting (21/89, 24%). Median clinical experience was 10 years as a hematologist/oncologist and 20 patients with MM per week (Table 1). Geographically, respondents were from North America (65%), Europe (23%), South America (8%), Asia (2%), and Australia (2%). Most clinicians (57/89, 64%) answered affirmatively to assessing for MRD in MM in a clinical (non-research) setting. There were no significant differences in demographics or background between MRD users and non-MRD users.

Demographics and attitudes toward MRD in multiple myeloma.

a Up to 3 answers allowed.

Of the 32 non-MRD users, the most common reasons (of 8 choices) for not using MRD were: inability to order MRD (22%), unclear when to assess for MRD (22%), lack of actionability (19%), and cost (16%) (Table 1). The most common (≥20%) areas of concern about using MRD status to guide decision making were (of 7 choices): no data to support decision making (44%), unknown appropriate timing (38%), and discomfort of bone marrow aspiration (25%). Of the 57 MRD users, the most common areas of concern were similar with a higher proportion (63%) stating there is no data to support decision making (Table 1).

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris—recommendation-specific supportive text—notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1-2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1-2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Shared decision making: a model for clinical practice [^feeaa67b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A MODEL FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE

To accomplish SDM, we propose a three-step model for clinical practice (see Fig. 1). We want to emphasize that this is a simplified model that illustrates the process of moving from initial to informed preferences. We acknowledge that this process also has psychological, social and emotional factors that will influence this deliberation space and that will need to be managed by an effective clinician-patient dialogue, seeking what Epstein has termed a ‘shared mind’.However, accepting these requirements, we aim for parsimony.

We describe three key steps of SDM for clinical practice, namely: choice talk, option talk and decision talk, where the clinician supports deliberation throughout the process (Fig. 1 and Boxes 1, 2 and 3). Choice talk refers to the step of making sure that patients know that reasonable options are available. Option talk refers to providing more detailed information about options and decision talk refers to supporting the work of considering preferences and deciding what is best. The model outlines a step-wise process, although it is important to recognize that the model is not prescriptive—clinical interactions are by necessity fluid. Decision support tools provide crucial inputs into this process.

Patients will want time to study new information and to consider their personal preferences, particularly for futures that are unknown to them, to think about outcome states that they have never experienced.Deliberation may, in part, be done outside the clinical encounter, although often patients wish to consolidate their views with a trusted clinician. Individuals often want to discuss options with others and it would be best if those involved could potentially use the same information resources (see below). Rapley has referred to this need to talk to others, at different times and places, as a ‘distributed’ deliberation process.Recognizing this need, and allowing time for it, is a cornerstone for effective SDM.

The model also includes the use of decision support interventions,which summarize information in formats that are accessible to patients, using the most up to date evidence about the harms and the benefits.Some tools also include preference clarification exercises.Decision support for patients can be in concise formats, such as in brief text or diagrams, and used during encounters to initiate SDM. They can also be extensive: typical of the many tools already developed—booklets, websites, videos, DVDs—to used by patients, their family and friends, outside the encounter, and at different time points—see Box 1, 2 and 3, and synopsis in Box 4.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, or a mitral regurgitation murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism is associated with tachycardia and dyspnea in >90% of patients and pain with inspiration. In suspected aortic dissection, the frequency of syncope >10% and aortic regurgitation (AR) 40%–75% (type A) are noted among findings. Esophageal rupture can present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax (20% patients) with unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Other causes include pericarditis with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and friction rub; myocarditis with fever, chest pain, heart failure, S3; pneumothorax with dyspnea and pain on inspiration and unilateral absence of breath sounds; costochondritis with tenderness of costochondral joints; and herpes zoster with pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch and a characteristic rash.

### Evaluation (...) [^6b5d9bfa]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Evaluation Exercise-related syncope, while generally a benign event, may sometimes be a precursor to sudden death and thus requires a thorough investigation. No definitive diagnostic test has been clearly identified.
16. The second critical distinction is whether the syncopal event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension that occurs after exercise, usually in association with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise. Prodromal symptoms occurring during exercise, including palpitations, chest pain, nausea, wheezing and pruritis, are also significant.

As in the evaluation of syncope in nonathletes, it is also important to identify whether syncope or dizziness occurs only in the upright position or also during sitting or supine positions. Echocardiography should be performed for the evaluation of murmurs that are diastolic, continuous, holosystolic or of intensity grade 3 or greater. Listening to the patient during squatting, while standing and during a Valsalva maneuver helps to rule out dynamic outflow obstruction. A systolic murmur that gets louder with standing or during a Valsalva maneuver suggests the obstruction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Conversely, a completely normal ECG is rare in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ECG clues to common pathologic conditions that present with syncope are listed in Table 1. Unexplained exercise-related syncope warrants restriction and an evaluation beginning with echocardiography preceding exercise stress testing.

A diagnosis made with the preceding tests should be managed as appropriate, while negative testing may warrant either careful observation or referral to a cardiologist for consideration of more advanced testing. In patients with an unremarkable echocardiogram and exercise stress test, a presumptive diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope may be the conclusion. If the event was clearly postexertional by history, nonrecurrent and associated with a normal physical examination and a normal ECG, patients may safely return to vigorous activity with careful observation. Athletes whose clinical pictures do not meet these criteria, on the other hand, warrant further evaluation by a cardiologist.

### AgentMD: empowering language agents for risk prediction with large-scale clinical tool learning [^2806f801]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Applying Medical Calculators to Patients with AgentMD

Figure 1b shows a high-level overview of how AgentMD computes risks from candidate calculators for any given patient in three main steps: tool selection, tool computation, and results summarization. In the tool selection step, AgentMD first retrieves the top ten most relevant calculators based on the matching between patient information and the calculator description with MedCPT, a foundation model for biomedical information retrieval. Then, AgentMD selects the eligible tools from the retrieved candidates using LLMs, with the goal of providing more accurate and explainable tool selections. The tool selection process is essential, as the interpretations of clinical calculators are based on the populations that participated in their original clinical studies. As such, calculators should only be applied to patients who meet the eligibility criteria. For each selected tool, AgentMD computes the risk of the patient by generating Python scripts via the corresponding calculator. During the tool computation process, AgentMD is provided with a Python interpreter to interact with – the environment returns the printed results or error messages when executing the code that AgentMD writes to use the clinical tools. Based on the returned information from the code interpreter, AgentMD either re-tries other code or summarizes the whole interaction history into a paragraph of the risk calculation results. If the required parameters from the clinical calculator are missing from the patient notes, AgentMD will make a range estimation based on the best- and worst-case scenarios.

Chain-of-thought baseline

We have compared AgentMD to the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)baseline in the evaluation with RiskQA. Specifically, CoT is a commonly used prompt engineering method that instructs the LLM to think step-by-step to solve the task. During the evaluation, AgentMD and the CoT baseline are provided with the same question inputs in RiskQA. Their only difference is that AgentMD can use the RiskCalcs toolkit, while the CoT baseline relies on the encoded knowledge within the backbone LLMs. The CoT prompt is shown below:

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8c3ef039]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Thoracic aortic dilation and aneurysm (TAD)—surveillance imaging: In patients with a dilated thoracic aorta, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended at the time of diagnosis to assess aortic valve anatomy, aortic valve function, and thoracic aortic diameters (COR 1, LOE C-LD). In patients with a dilated thoracic aorta, a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of diagnosis is reasonable to assess thoracic aortic anatomy and diameters (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). For follow-up, in patients with a dilated thoracic aorta, imaging (with TTE, CT, or MRI, as appropriate based on individual anatomy) in 6 to 12 months is reasonable to determine the rate of aortic enlargement; if stable, surveillance imaging every 6 to 24 months (depending on aortic diameter) is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). Supportive text notes that TTE usually provides clear images of the aortic root and ascending aorta, is safe and reproducible, and can be used for longitudinal surveillance, and that in select patients with difficult echocardiographic imaging windows, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is an alternative for evaluating aortic valve anatomy and aortic dimensions.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^c8daabc0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Algorithm for antiretroviral management of infants with in utero or intrapartum HIV exposure classifies risk using the question “HIV RNA ≥50 copies/mL at any point after 20 weeks’ gestation?” followed by “Did this viremia occur in the 4 weeks prior to delivery?”. If the answer is Yes, the “High Risk of In Utero and Intrapartum HIV Transmission” branch specifies “Birth HIV NAT, PLUS” and “Three-drug presumptive HIV therapy regimen for 2–6 weeks*” with “*Note: ZDV prophylaxis for 6 weeks total (see Table 11)”. If the answer is No, “Infant ARV Management Decision-Making Guided by Clinical Scenario” includes “Birth HIV NAT, followed by a three-drug presumptive HIV therapy regimen for 2–6 weeks. If the birth PCR is negative, de-escalate to ZDV alone to complete ZDV prophylaxis for 2–6 weeks total (see Table 11)” or “ZDV prophylaxis for 2–6 weeks total (see Table 11)”. For “Low Risk of HIV Transmission,” the algorithm states “ZDV prophylaxis for 2 weeks total”. A footnote explains that “Early (acute or recent) HIV infection in pregnancy may result in a scenario where viremia occurs early in gestation but is suppressed after 20 weeks and through the remainder of pregnancy until delivery. In these situations, decision-making guided by the clinical scenario is recommended (see Table 11).” Abbreviations are defined: “ARV = antiretroviral; NAT = nucleic acid test; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; ZDV = zidovudine”.

ACC/AHA aortic disease—physical activity and quality of life recommendations specify: For patients with significant aortic disease, education and guidance should be provided about avoiding intense isometric exercises (eg, heavy weightlifting or activities requiring the Valsalva maneuver), burst exertion and activities, and collision sports (COR 1, LOE C-EO).

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes—symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds’ duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, “worse chest pain of my life,” especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^8a3bd100]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis—when to intervene?

When assessing a patient with aortic valve stenosis, some essential questions have to be asked and answered. How severe is the aortic stenosis? Does the patient have symptoms? Are the symptoms related to valvular disease? What are the patient’s life expectancy and expected quality of life? Do the expected benefits of intervention outweigh its risks? Are local resources optimal for the planned intervention? What is the patient’s preference?

Echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool. It confirms the presence of aortic valve stenosis; assesses the degree of valve calcification, left ventricular (LV)function and wall thickness and detects the presence of other associated valve disease or aortic pathology. Doppler echocardiography is the preferred technique for assessing the severity of the aortic valve stenosis.

In accordance with the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines, early therapy is strongly recommended in all symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient aortic stenosis (mean gradient≥40 mm Hg or peak velocity≥4 m/s; class I, level of evidence (LoE) B). For this patient group, there is virtually no lower ejection fraction limit for intervention. The only exceptions are patients with severe comorbidities indicating a survival of <1 year and patients in whom severe comorbidities or their general condition at an advanced age make it unlikely that the intervention will improve quality of life or survival (class III, LoE C).

### Choice architecture in physician-patient communication: a mixed-methods assessments of physicians' competency [^cf122711]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Physicians predict influences based on personal experiences

Physicians based their responses to scenario-based questions on prior professional experiences or their own anticipated responses. A minority of their responses were based on specific training or education. Reflecting on the influence of relative risk bias, one resident developed the following prediction:

… if you say 20% experience a complication vs 10%, perfect, I’m, like, okay. But if you say it’s twice as likely to cause a complication, then that sounds a lot more concerning to me as a patient …

In this way, physicians may have been more successful at predicting the impact of certain decision-making principles of choice architecture, such as social norms and default effect, because the influence of these principles seemed to be ‘common sense’ or more ‘intuitive’. When their predictions based on personal reactions were incorrect, they found the choice architecture to be surprising, counterintuitive or ‘shocking’. Physicians struggled to understand the influence of certain choice architecture on patients and caregivers due to differences in perspective and education. For example, some physicians were unable to predict the patient’s response to a choice presentation because of prior professional training. Reflecting on the relative risk bias, one physician commented:

[Physicians] are well versed in [statistics] and we can go back and forth between the percentages and the ratios. If you know both you probably may not be thinking about how you’re presenting it to the patient. They don’t know both. You do. So, for you to say twice as much or 20% vs 10%, it doesn’t mean anything [to the physicians]. But it does to the patient.

Similarly, physicians scored poorly in predictions of anchoring bias. The rationale for their incorrect answers revealed that physicians were less susceptible to the specific anchoring scenario due to their medical knowledge and therefore were less likely to recognise its influence on patients:

When providing or estimating the risk of a genetic disease, if the [patient’s] oldest living relative is 90, compared to 50, there’s a huge difference and it may be totally unrelated to the genetic disease. So I don’t think that a number in and of itself, a random number, should have anything to do with what one assumes is a risk factor when estimating the likelihood of acquiring a genetic disease.

### Dyspnoea on exertion in a 53-year-old woman [^031bd972]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 53-year-old woman with no previous medical history complained of easy fatigue over the last 6 months. She had a positive family history for coronary artery disease but no other risk factors. On physical examination, a 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard over the apex, and the lung auscultation was unremarkable. Her ECG showed a left anterior fascicular block, with poor R wave progression in the anterior leads (see online supplementary image A). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a slightly dilated for the patient's body surface area (BSA) (1.73m 2 ) left ventricle (55/35mm), with preserved systolic function and a moderate functional mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 45mm Hg. During treadmill radionuclide scintigraphy, her exercise tolerance was normal, with good inotropic response, and 96% oxygen saturation at rest and at peak exercise. A 2mm ST segment depression was noted at peak effort, which persisted well into recovery (see online supplementary image B). The scintigraphy scan showed extensive reversible anteroapical wall ischaemia (see online supplementary image C). At this point she was referred to us for right and left heart catheterisation. Intracardiac pressures and saturations were: right atrium (RA)RA=3mm Hg, right ventricle (RV)=26/3mm Hg, Pulmonary artery (PA)=26/10/mean 16mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)=11mm Hg, left ventricle (LV)=110/10mm Hg, Aorta (Ao)=110/60/mean 80mm Hg, Superior vena cava saturation (SVCsat)=62%, RAsat=62%, PAsat=78%, Aosat=96%and estimated pulmonary to systematic flow ratio (Qp/Qs)=1.8. Her coronary angiography and CT angiography are shown in figure 1A,B.DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017-311256.supp1Supplementary material 1 DC2SP210.1136/heartjnl-2017-311256.supp2Supplementary material 2 DC3SP310.1136/heartjnl-2017-311256.supp3Supplementary material 3 heartjnl;103/17/1390/F1F1F1Figure 1Coronary and CT angiograms.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize an exacerbation as a worsening of symptoms that exceeds day-to-day variability and necessitates a change in management. Core symptoms include changes in cough, sputum volume and/or consistency, sputum purulence, dyspnea and/or exercise intolerance, fatigue or malaise, and hemoptysis. Additional clinical features may include fever, wheezing, general discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and changes on chest examination. Recognize features of a severe exacerbation, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotic treatment, which may include tachypnea, acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure, a significant decline in oxygen saturation or respiratory function, hypercapnia, hemoptysis, new onset of cyanosis, new signs of cor pulmonale, hemodynamic instability, and/or impaired cognitive function.

Recommendation statement types and clinician implications—strong recommendation (StrRec) means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec) means benefits exceed harms with not-as-strong evidence and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt) means the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain—of few seconds’ duration—is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease.

### The athletic preparticipation evaluation: cardiovascular assessment (...) [^94d8b57c]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

RED FLAG SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Patients with exercise-related syncope or presyncope require further evaluation to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. 1, 14, 15 Syncope or presyncope may indicate left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, arrhythmia, or congenital coronary anomalies. More benign causes include vasovagal syncope, exercise-associated collapse, hypoglycemia, and medication use. 1, 3, 14 Patients should not participate in athletics during this evaluation. 15 If syncope or presyncope remains unexplained, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist. Symptomatic patients should be evaluated thoroughly before returning to athletic participation. 14–16. Exercise-induced asthma is a common cause of exertional chest pain in young athletes. Although significant cardiac disease is an uncommon cause, . 1 exertional chest pain in this population can be a sign of left ventricular outf low tract obstruction or coronary artery anomalies.

In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, labile outf low tract obstruction that is provoked by changes in preload, afterload, and contractility may cause symptoms only during peak physical exertion or in volume-depleted states. 17 A congenital coronary anomaly, most often a coronary artery that arises from the opposite aortic sinus, should be suspected when an athlete presents with chest pain or syncope. Because of the transient or episodic nature of this ischemia, it often is not detected on static or exercise ECG. Diagnosis requires echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac computed tomography, or cardiac catheterization.
4. Palpitations may signify an arrhythmia. The patient history should explore the abruptness of onset, the heart rate, and the regularity of episodes.

A gradual onset and relief of palpitations on exertion suggests a sinus tachycardia, whereas a sudden onset of a fast heart rate suggests supraventricular tachycardia, especially if it can be resolved with vagal maneuvers. Dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigue are nonspecific symptoms that may simply represent poor conditioning, or they may be initial signs of primary pulmonary hypertension, profound anemia, exercise-induced asthma, or an underlying cardiovascular disorder. If an athlete previously has been diagnosed with hypertension, dyslipidemia, myocarditis, or other cardiac abnormalities, the physician should obtain information on previous participation restrictions. Echocardiography should be performed prior to exercise testing to rule out aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes—diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg (or ≥30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg that takes ≥3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^0cafaa9c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA aortic atherosclerotic disease—recommendations and supporting evidence are as follows: In patients with aortic atherosclerotic disease and concomitant coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD) or both, it is recommended to prescribe antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy or both, guided by the clinical setting. In patients with aortic atherosclerotic disease and risk factors for confirmed coronary artery disease, it is reasonable to prescribe a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In patients with aortic atheromas of a thickness ≥4 mm, statin therapy may be reasonable. Atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch is a potential source of emboli to the brain, and a prospective study (N=500) reported the OR for stroke among patients with aortic atheromatous plaques of ≥4 mm versus controls was 9.1 (95% CI, 3.3-25.2; P<0.001). In a clinical trial of 519 patients with severe thoracic aortic plaques, multivariate analysis showed that statin therapy was protective against strokes (P=0.0001); these data relate to atheroma thickness of ≥4 mm, whereas commonly used grading systems define severe atheromas by a thickness of >5 mm, and there is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic anticoagulation in this population.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^828dac56]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO male breast cancer guideline—post-treatment follow-up recommends that physicians should counsel patients about the symptoms of recurrence, including new lumps, bone pain, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or persistent headaches, and notes that the risk of breast cancer recurrence continues through 15 years after primary treatment and beyond; continuity of care for patients with breast cancer is recommended and should be performed by a physician experienced in the surveillance of patients with cancer and in breast examination, including the examination of irradiated breasts (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Recommendation 7 is adapted from the guideline for women, and there is no evidence from clinical trials in men with breast cancer to inform clinical questions regarding the optimal post-treatment surveillance and management after primary treatment; follow-up care for men who are treated for breast cancer should generally be similar to care provided for women with breast cancer. However, men who are receiving a GnRH analog and an AI are at increased risk of bone loss; thus, monitoring bone mineral density in this group is warranted.

3.4 Cough and exercise

Cough is frequently reported by athletic individuals during and/or post‐exercise.The presence of exercise‐related cough is typically taken to indicate underlying asthma or EIB. However, in many cases, athletic individuals reporting cough do not have objective evidence of BHR or heightened airway inflammation,thus suggesting a more generalized cough hypersensitivity process. Furthermore, there is now improved recognition that cough is a common symptom in other prevalent airway disorders, such as EILO.

In contrast to problematic cough in the general population, exercise‐related cough is typically associated with sport‐specific environmental exposures (i.e. aeroallergen, irritants and pollutants) and occurs most frequently following high‐intensity exercise.Despite several studies evaluating the impact of exercise on cough, there currently remains a paucity of data regarding the optimal approach to diagnostic work‐up and treatment. It remains the case that individuals presenting with exercise‐related cough should undergo assessment to rule out allergic or asthma‐related causes, but due consideration should also be given for a potential contribution from airway reflux, nasal disease and/or a generalized hypersensitivity process.Following an initial assessment, a systematic investigation based on suspected causes of cough should follow, with specific attention to the sporting discipline (i.e. exercise mode and intensity) and training environment.Due to the lack of research in the area, exercise‐related cough should be reviewed and managed as per recommendations in the general population (see Boulet et al.).

3.5 Other pathological and non‐pathological causes of respiratory symptoms

The cause of respiratory symptoms (e.g. breathlessness) in young athletic individuals is broad and thus differential diagnoses should be considered when common conditions have been ruled out and/or if the patient remains refractory to standard treatment. This should include consideration for cardiac disease, but other relevant, less common respiratory‐related pathological conditions, such as large airway collapse, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, anaemia, swimming‐induced pulmonary oedema (SIPE) should also be considered. Non‐pathological issues such as obesity ± physical deconditioning may also contribute to an increased work of breathing and/or heightened perception of breathlessness (Table 3).

A shared decision-making model—key components and definitions include deliberation (a process where patients become aware of choice, understand options, and have time and support to consider ‘what matters most to them’), choice talk (conveys awareness that a choice exists, initiated by either a patient or a clinician, possibly before the clinical encounter), option talk (patients are informed about treatment options in more detail), and decision talk (patients are supported to explore ‘what matters most to them’, having become informed). Decision support is designed in two formats: 1) brief enough to be used by clinician and patient together and 2) more extensive, designed to be used by patients either before or after clinical encounters (paper, DVD, web). Awareness of options leads to the development of initial preferences, with the goal to arrive at informed preferences; informed preferences are personal preferences based on ‘what matters most to patients’, predicated on an understanding of the most relevant benefits and harms.

### Three questions to ask before using model outputs for decision support [^276900e2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A way forward

Models tend to look right as they are presented with the claim of being realistic enough for their purpose. Looking right, though, has many dimensions, and we suggest the three screening questions presented here as a simple approach for decision makers to disentangle them. Once we know a model’s purpose, we can assess whether its organization is meaningful; once we know its purpose and organization, we can assess whether it represents the real system dynamics relevant to a specific problem; once we know which patterns it can reproduce, we can assess whether its model outputs can support decisions; and once we have answered all three questions for a suite of models they can be compared and taken into account to varying degrees. The three questions do not replace more detailed guidelines on GMP,, but they provide a simple and effective common language that will allow us to develop models and use their outputs for decision support in a more transparent, robust, and safe way.

It is still important to keep in mind that models can only support decisions. The responsibility for using model outputs lies with decision makers. Answers to the three screening questions allow them to transparently base their decisions on a weight-of-evidence approach, and to update their decisions when new data and updated models are available.

Common Questions and Answers

1. Where is the needle? 

The needle is attached to the autoinjector and covered by the orange cap.

When you unscrew the orange cap, the green shield keeps the needle covered until you inject.

For more information, please see Figure N in Step 3B in the Instructions for Use.

2. How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed? 

After shaking the autoinjector, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine along the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the autoinjector hard until the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even throughout.

3. Why do I need to hold the autoinjector upright while removing the orange cap? Holding the autoinjector with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal to see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.

4. Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it? If you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will not get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your autoinjector is in the locked position. However, after you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. You cannot save it for later use.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^637f0dc6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)—presentation, demographics, and risk factors: IPF “is a specific form of chronic, progressive, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. It occurs primarily in older adults, is limited to the lungs, and is defined by the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of UIP.” It “should be considered in all adult patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea, cough, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and/or digital clubbing that occur without constitutional or other symptoms that suggest a multisystem disease.” Rarely, “patients with IPF may present with an acute exacerbation as an initial manifestation (i.e., an unexplained worsening of dyspnea over a few weeks and new ground-glass opacification on HRCT scan with a background of lower lobe fibrotic change),” and “Patients with IPF who are younger than 50 years old are rare.” The guideline notes that “More men have been reported with IPF than women, and the majority of patients have a history of past or cigarette smoking,” identifies “Other risk factors associated with IPF include gastroesophageal reflux, chronic viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, and a family history of ILD,” and states “At least 30% of patients who have sporadic or familial pulmonary fibrosis have genetic predisposing factors that are known to increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis.”

### 'What happens if I do nothing?' A systematic review of the inclusion and quantitative description of a' No active intervention' option in patient decision aids [^8759ea0a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We conducted an international environmental scan of decision aids (with no language restriction), searching databases and websites (Box 1) during October 2018. A decision aid was defined as an evidence-based tool designed to help patients make specific and deliberated choices among healthcare options.To be eligible, the full aid needed to be freely obtainable. Each aid’s content was analyzed independently by two raters. Data extracted included health condition; decision under consideration; whether a ‘no active intervention’ option was presented (if so, the verbatim wording) and whether quantification of that option’s consequences (e.g. likelihood of an outcome, timeframe of illness duration and/or recovery) were provided. For aids without a ‘no active intervention’ option and/or quantitative description, discussion was held between the three authors as to whether that was appropriate. For aids without a ‘no active intervention’ option, we assessed if the aid was a ‘focused’ aid (see Fig. 1) and therefore reasonable to not include this option.

Decision aids grouped according to whether they included a ‘no active intervention’ option and quantitative description of it.

Determinants of recommendation strength—certainty, patient values, cost, and examples emphasize that “The second determinant of the strength of a recommendation is the certainty in the effect estimates.” In acutely ill medical patients, “For instance, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has an apparent benefit in reducing symptomatic PE, symptomatic DVT, major bleeding, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, compared with UFH, in acutely ill medical patients,” yet “The 5 randomized trials from which the evidence came were, however, judged at serious risk of bias due to an unclear randomization sequence-generation process and absence of blinding, and provided imprecise estimates,” and “the body of evidence was rated down as low certainty,” so “In this scenario, use of LMWH over UFH warrants a conditional recommendation.” With respect to values, “The third determinant of the strength of a recommendation is uncertainty about, or variability in, the relative importance patients assign to the outcomes,” such that “If significant variability in patients’ values is known or assumed, it is expected that patients’ preferences for 1 treatment option over another will also vary; hence a strong recommendation would be inappropriate.” Regarding resources, “Cost is another determinant of the strength of a recommendation,” and “ASH guidelines are generally focused on well-resourced settings; however, efforts to adapt guidelines to lower-resource settings are pursued when these considerations become more context dependent.” An applied conditional example is “a conditional recommendation for a longer (6-12 week) international normalized ratio (INR) recall interval over a shorter (4-week) INR recall interval, during periods of stable INR control, for patients taking a vitamin K antagonist.”

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9cc9ee6b]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, when putting the findings of these meta-analyses into clinical context, the baseline characteristics of the patient population included, and more specifically the age, should be taken into consideration. The participants of both trials and of some of the observational studies were relatively young, with a mean age of less than 70 years old. This may not fully reflect the cohort of patients usually seen in secondary or tertiary care, which may consist of older patients with more comorbidities and therefore higher operative risk.

Despite differences and limitations of the studies, all the data from this meta-analysis would support consideration of an earlier approach and highlight, however given the differences and limitations in the two studies, it would be prudent to allow the ongoing research in the field to complete. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis gives us an early insight as to what outcome we could expect. It is noteworthy that in a large registry that included more than 25 000 patients with aortic stenosis, the individuals with moderate aortic stenosis exhibited a surprisingly high risk of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths, which was similar to those with severe aortic stenosis.Whether this finding means that some patients with parameters in the moderate spectrum of the disease are at high risk of death from the valvular disease alone or that, inevitably, comorbidities in this cohort play a much more significant role than previously thought remains unclear. Nevertheless, in the era of personalised medicine, the identification of the high-risk population and the decision regarding intervention should be made after careful individual risk assessment and evaluation not only of symptoms but also of indirect signs of myocardial decompensation and damage that could have a negative impact on the prognosis and outcome. Such parameters could include the presence of mid-wall late gadolinium enhancement of cardiovascular magnetic resonance, utilisation of left ventricular stroke volume in preference to LVEF or various biomarkers (eg, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide/BNP, high-sensitivity troponin), which are associated with a worse outcome.These clues could help refine the optimal timing of intervention for each patient.The results of currently ongoing randomised trials investigating these parameters are greatly anticipated to help clarify the role of these parameters in the risk assessment of patients with severe aortic stenosis and the impact of early intervention on the outcome and prognosis. The main characteristics of these trials are summarised in table 4.
