## Question

A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, she is semiconscious and incoherent. She has shortness of breath and is cyanotic. Her pulse is 112/min, respirations are 59/min, and blood pressure is 128/89 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration on the forehead and multiple abrasions over the thorax and abdomen. There is crepitation on palpation of the thorax on the right. Auscultation of the lung shows decreased breath sounds on the right side. A crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat is heard best over the precordium. There is dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax. The lips and tongue have a bluish discoloration. There is an open femur fracture on the left. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:\\npH 7.31\\nPCO2 55 mm Hg\\nPO2 42 mm Hg\\nHCO3–22 mEq/L\\nO2 saturation 76%\\nThe patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?'
A. Bronchial rupture
B. Flail chest
C. Myocardial rupture
D. Pulmonary embolism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a 28-year-old woman presenting with severe hypoxemia, chest trauma, and a precordial crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat, considering options such as bronchial rupture, flail chest, myocardial rupture, and pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which physical sign is pathognomonic and how it steers the diagnosis. Then, I should verify the clinical features of the other options to ensure none fit better. Next, I will reconcile any discrepancies, like dullness on percussion, against the leading diagnosis. Finally, I will consider immediate implications for management and the diagnostic test of choice, while keeping an eye on the time course to exclude entities that typically present later.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal finding. A precordial crunching or clicking sound synchronous with the heartbeat — Hamman's sign — is classically associated with pneumomediastinum or, less commonly, a left-sided pneumothorax; it is described as a pathognomonic auscultatory clue in these conditions, and it strongly suggests air in the mediastinum rather than primary cardiac valvular disease or myocardial rupture, so I should not overlook this [^1168gMLa] [^115gq6YC].

> Now, I need to map the other exam findings to that hypothesis. Decreased breath sounds on the right with crepitation and severe hypoxemia can reflect concomitant pneumothorax, rib fractures, or lung contusion, but they do not negate pneumomediastinum; importantly, pneumomediastinum frequently coexists with pneumothorax or tracheobronchial injury in blunt trauma, and contemporary trauma series describe extensive subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and even tension pneumopericardium after high-speed crashes, which aligns with this presentation [^111du926] [^1134QPxL].

> Wait, let me verify the alternative options before jumping to conclusions. Flail chest typically presents with paradoxical motion and is a purely mechanical cause of hypoventilation and contusion-related shunt, but it does not produce Hamman's sign; that mismatch makes flail chest a poorer fit for the precordial crunch, though it could still contribute to hypoxemia if present [^1168gMLa]. Myocardial rupture tends to present with tamponade physiology — hypotension, distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds — and does not produce a precordial crunch; while blunt cardiac injury is on the differential after high-speed trauma, the absence of classic tamponade features and the presence of Hamman's sign make this less likely here [^114jSKYP] [^113fLWVr]. Pulmonary embolism after trauma is uncommon in the immediate post-injury window and would not be expected to generate a precordial crunch, making it a poor fit for the cardinal sign here [^1168gMLa].

> Hold on, I should double-check the dullness to percussion detail. Dullness suggests fluid or consolidation rather than air, so on first pass I thought it might contradict pneumomediastinum; but wait, let me reconsider — coexisting hemothorax or pleural effusion would cause dullness, and in blunt trauma it is common to have mixed patterns such as hemopneumothorax or pneumothorax with effusion, so dullness on the right does not exclude pneumomediastinum; it simply indicates an additional process layering with the air leak syndrome, which is entirely plausible in a high-speed MVC.

> Let me think about pathophysiology and time course to ensure internal consistency. Pneumomediastinum arises when alveolar or airway pressure exceeds tissue resistance, allowing air to dissect into the mediastinum; this can occur with blunt chest trauma, tracheobronchial injury, or alveolar rupture, and the finding of Hamman's sign typically appears early when air tracks into the mediastinum and moves with cardiac pulsations, which fits the 30-minute post-crash presentation here [^1134QPxL] [^115gq6YC].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic implications and immediate steps. I will now examine the imaging choice: in blunt chest trauma with suspected air leak or tracheobronchial injury, a chest CT is the modality of choice to detect pneumomediastinum, define the extent of subcutaneous emphysema, identify associated pneumothorax or hemothorax, and evaluate the tracheobronchial tree for tears. If pneumothorax is present, tube thoracostomy is indicated, and bronchoscopy is warranted when tracheobronchial injury is suspected, which matches contemporary management pathways for traumatic pneumomediastinum and tracheobronchial trauma [^1134QPxL] [^114zqeRr].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is pneumomediastinum with associated air leak, likely with a concurrent right-sided process such as pneumothorax or hemothorax, and the key distinguishing feature is Hamman's sign, which is pathognomonic for pneumomediastinum in this context and not explained by flail chest, myocardial rupture, or pulmonary embolism [^1168gMLa] [^115gq6YC].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **bronchial rupture** (tracheobronchial injury) [^1134QPxL] given the combination of severe hypoxemia, unilateral decreased breath sounds, subcutaneous emphysema (crepitation), and Hamman's sign (precordial crunch synchronous with heartbeat) [^1168gMLa] [^115gq6YC] — classic features of airway disruption with mediastinal air. Flail chest would not cause Hamman's sign [^115gq6YC], myocardial rupture would present with tamponade or hemodynamic collapse [^114jSKYP], and pulmonary embolism is unlikely in the immediate post-trauma setting. Immediate management includes securing the airway, avoiding high-pressure ventilation, and urgent chest CT [^1134QPxL] with bronchoscopy to confirm and localize the injury.

---

## Clinical features supporting bronchial rupture

- **Hypoxemia and cyanosis**: Severe hypoxemia (PaO2 42 mm Hg, O2 saturation 76%) with cyanosis indicates significant impairment of gas exchange, consistent with airway disruption and inadequate ventilation.

- **Decreased breath sounds on the right**: Unilateral decreased breath sounds are characteristic of bronchial rupture, as the disrupted airway fails to deliver adequate airflow to the affected lung segment [^notfound].

- **Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitation)**: Palpable crepitation on the right thorax indicates air leakage into the subcutaneous tissues, a hallmark of airway injury [^1134QPxL].

- **Hamman's sign**: A precordial crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat is pathognomonic for pneumomediastinum, strongly suggesting airway rupture with mediastinal air [^1168gMLa] [^115gq6YC].

- **Dullness on percussion**: Dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax suggests associated hemothorax or pleural effusion, commonly associated with bronchial rupture [^notfound].

---

## Arterial blood gas analysis

The ABG shows **respiratory acidosis** (pH 7.31, PaCO2 55 mm Hg, HCO3–22 mEq/L) with **severe hypoxemia** (PaO2 42 mm Hg, O2 saturation 76%), consistent with inadequate ventilation and impaired oxygenation due to airway disruption.

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Compatibility with case** |
|-|-|-|
| Bronchial rupture | - Decreased breath sounds <br/> - Subcutaneous emphysema <br/> - Hamman's sign <br/> - Hypoxemia | Highly compatible |
| Flail chest | - Multiple rib fractures <br/> - Paradoxical chest wall movement <br/> - Hypoxemia | - Compatible <br/> - But no Hamman's sign |
| Myocardial rupture | - Hemodynamic instability <br/> - Cardiac tamponade <br/> - Muffled heart sounds | Not compatible |
| Pulmonary embolism | - Sudden dyspnea <br/> - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Hypoxemia | Not compatible |

---

## Conclusion and management

Bronchial rupture is the most likely diagnosis given the **classic clinical features and ABG findings**. Immediate management includes securing the airway with **cautious intubation** [^1134QPxL] to avoid exacerbating the injury, avoiding high-pressure ventilation, and arranging **urgent chest CT** [^1134QPxL] and bronchoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and guide definitive management.

NASEMSO Model Clinical Guideline: Prehospital Airway Management — assessment of respiratory distress in children prioritizes signs of upper airway obstruction, abnormal respiratory pattern/effort, accessory muscle use, skin color, and mental status. Evidence of upper airway obstruction is noted by stridor that can indicate infectious etiologies or a foreign body. Abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort are characterized by tachypnea and retractions being very common in children with respiratory distress, with evaluation for excessive abdominal breathing, weak crying, and the inability to speak in full sentences. Accessory muscle use is described as retractions, including subcostal, intercostal, and supraclavicular. Skin color guidance states cyanosis is uncommon and a late finding in young children with respiratory distress, while pallor and mottled skin are earlier signs that are important to notice. Mental status assessment underscores consolability and warns that a young child who is not bothered by clinical care can be a sign of severe illness. Additional observable features include work of breathing findings such as tachypnea, retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, and circulation descriptors of pink, well-perfused, mottled, pale, or cyanosis.

Direct communication of the right pulmonary artery and the left atrium is an extremely rare congenital malformation of the pulmonary vasculature. A 41-year-old woman with a history of cyanosis since childhood presented with mild exertional dyspnea. On physical examination, she had central cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, and an upright position caused by orthodeoxia. Imaging studies showed a very large aneurysm in the distal right pulmonary artery with a direct communication to the left atrium. The patient underwent successful repair, with resolution of hypoxia and exertional symptoms.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old G3P2A1 woman with no significant past medical or surgical history was admitted on postpartum day 4 and presented with repeating hemoptysis and increasing dyspnea. She coughed up 10–20 mL fresh blood for 4 days and complained of dyspnea that increased on exertion and was relieved by rest after spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, with a healthy female child at 38 weeks and 1 day. Her first pregnancy was miscarried at 2 months, and her second pregnancy went well and gave birth to a girl by vaginal delivery. The girl is 3 years old and doing well. Social and family history were unremarkable.

On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with temperature 37.5 °C, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 28, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Physical examination was significant for tachycardia; otherwise, the patient presented with a regular rhythm, dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, and no breath sounds to the right side. The skin showed no sign of petechiae and ecchymosis. Laboratory tests revealed fibrinogen (FIB) 5.82 g/L, thrombin time (TT) 11.5 s, prethrombin time ratio (PTR) 0.86, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 26 s, prothrombin time (PT) 11 s, international normalized ratio (INR) of PT 0.88; D-dimer 620 μg/L; white blood cell count 11.2 × 10⁹/L, Platelet count 223 × 10⁹/L, Hemoglobin 88 g/L, Red blood cell count 4.05 × 10¹²/L; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 78.8 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21.7 pg, and mean corpuscular-hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 276.0 g/L. The absolute counts and percentages of other blood cells were within the normal ranges. Arterial blood gas analysis on 5 L nasal cannula showed pH 7.385; pO₂ 78 mmHg; pCO₂ 32.5 mmHg, HCO₃ 22 mmol/L; O₂ saturation 95.8%, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio 190. The rest of the laboratory results, including the comprehensive metabolic panel, inflammation markers, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), were all within normal limits. Autoimmune and vasculitis panels were negative. Complement levels and immunoglobin levels were all unremarkable. Chest radiographs suggested right lung atelectasis (Fig. 1 a). Although D-dimer and FIB were mildly elevated, the patient never complained of any epistaxis or bleeding gums; combined with a normal platelet count and the absence of petechiae and ecchymosis, hemoptysis caused by coagulation dysfunction was not supported. CT was further performed to determine the causes of bleeding, revealing a 2.1 × 3.2 cm 2 inhomogeneous tumorous lesion in the right superior mediastinum and a right main bronchus obstruction along with right upper lobe obstructive pneumonia and atelectasis of the right lung, particularly the right middle and lower lobes (Fig. 1 b–e). No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Flexible bronchoscopy showed a tumorous protrusion blocking the right main bronchus with active hemorrhage (Fig. 1 f, g). Malignancy was suspected. Although the cause of the bleeding was unclear, biopsy was not performed because the irritation produced by the biopsy procedure may have caused rupture of unidentified aneurysms or repeating, massive bleeding. Interventional angiography and bronchial artery embolization (BAE) were performed instead. The arteriogram revealed tortuosity, dilation and hypertrophy of the right bronchial arteries (Fig. 2 a). Angiography showed aneurysms of the internal thoracic artery (Fig. 2 b). The right bronchial arteries were embolized with 500 μm polyvinyl alcohol particles and gelatin sponges. The aneurysms of the internal thoracic artery were embolized with a metal coil (Fig. 2 c, d). A stent was placed in the opening of the right internal thoracic portion of the right subclavian artery. The bleeding completely stopped after BAE. Bronchoscopy was performed again to remove residual materials (Fig. 2 e–g). Pathology confirmed these were blood clots (Fig. 2 h). The patient recovered soon after the procedure (Fig. 2 i) and received regular outpatient follow-up (Fig. 2 j, k).

The main data of this case are presented (see Table 1) together with the main data of the 8 cases (cases 1 through 8) of isolated RAA rupture reported in the literature. Eleven other RAA cases mentioned in the literature without clear informative data are not included here.

The 9 cases (see Table) comprised 5 men and 4 women, aged 15 to 34 (mean: 28) years, all involved in high speed MVC (8 cars and 1 motorcycle). The victims were a motorcyclist (case 1), unrestrained car drivers (cases 2, 3, 4, 5, 8), or passengers (cases 7 and 9), or unspecified position (case 6). Overall, the main diagnostic findings in these 9 cases included hypotension or persistent unresponsive shock (cases 4, 5, 8, 9), muffled heart sounds (cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 9), high CVP values (cases 1, 3, 9), neck vein distension (cases 2, 5, 6), thoracic imaging alterations (cases 2, 4, 5, 6, 9), and traumatic ascitis (case 7). Cardiac tamponade was present in the 9 cases. All the patients underwent a thoracotomy allowing RAA injury identification and repair, and all patients survived. The length of hospital stay ranged from 8 to 20 days.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or cyanosis, and peripheral pulses were symmetrical and palpable. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and normal chest expansion. The gastrointestinal examination was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no organomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination revealed no chest wall tenderness, and the thoracic cage appeared normal. The patient had a full range of motion in the upper limbs, with no evidence of joint or muscle abnormalities. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with intact cranial nerves and normal motor and sensory functions.

### Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) [^112yASeG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of brentuximab vedotin IV (also known as Adcetris):
- **Anaphylaxis**: use caution in patients with a history of infusion-related reactions.
- **Chronic pulmonary disease**: use caution risk factors for pulmonary toxicity.
- **Colitis**: use caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease.
- **Gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding**: use caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease or a history of lymphoma with gastrointestinal involvement. Prior to initiating Brentuximab vedotin, assess patients for risk factors of GI complications and consider dose adjustments or alternative treatments if necessary. If serious GI complications like perforation, bleeding, or erosion occur, discontinue Brentuximab vedotin, initiate appropriate medical interventions, and manage the patient's condition.
- **Hematologic disorder**: use caution risk factors for myelosuppression.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution pre-existing diabetes mellitus.
- **Increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly during Brentuximab vedotin treatment, especially in patients at risk for hyperglycemia, and manage blood sugar levels appropriately. Implement appropriate diabetes management strategies, which may include adjusting medications or insulin dosages under medical supervision.
- **Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia**: use extreme caution with advanced age, a history of hematologic disorder, and who received brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy. Obtain CBCs prior to each brentuximab dose and more frequently if grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurs; monitor all patients for fever. Therapy interruption, dosage reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: use caution in patients with risk factors for Peripheral neuropathy. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy (e.g., hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness). Therapy interruption, dosage reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop new or worsening peripheral neuropathy.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: use caution in patients with symptoms of neuropathy.
- **Pneumonitis, ILD, ARDS**: use extreme caution with a history of pulmonary illness or concomitant use of brentuximab with bleomycin-containing chemotherapy. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity such as cough and dyspnea. Evaluate patients who develop new or worsening pulmonary symptoms; hold brentuximab until symptoms improve. Most cases resolved following corticosteroid treatment.
- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: use extreme caution in patients with prior immunosuppressive therapies or immunosuppressive disease. Evaluate patients who develop new neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs and symptoms such as changes in mood or behavior; confusion; memory impairment; changes in vision, speech, or walking. Hold therapy if PML is suspected; discontinue brentuximab in patients with confirmed PML.
- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: use extreme caution in patients with rapidly proliferating tumors and/or a high tumor burden. Monitor patients for signs of TLS (e.g., serum electrolytes, uric acid, serum creatinine) prior to and during therapy. Institute appropriate prophylactic and treatment (e.g., hydration, uric acid lowering therapy) as necessary.

### VSD following blunt cardiac trauma: MRI findings [^113nicB7]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

In this report, we describe the clinical and radiographic findings of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) following blunt cardiac trauma in two patients. VSDs following either penetrating or blunt cardiac trauma are a rare occurrence. The variable presentation and timing of symptom onset along with the common association of other injuries can make the diagnosis of a posttraumatic VSD difficult. Therefore, investigation should be initiated when elements from the history and physical examination (e.g., new onset murmur), laboratory tests (e.g., cardiac enzymes), EKG, and CT or echocardiography warrant it. The first patient was a 19-year-old male who was hemodynamically stable on initial presentation to this trauma center after a motor vehicle collision. A posttraumatic VSD was found by echocardiography on the day of admission and further defined on cardiac MRI (CMRI). The second patient was a 31-year-oid male who presented after a high-speed motorcycle accident and was found to have a VSD 40 days later on CMRI after a fluctuating clinical course and multiple normal echocardiograms. Both patients had good outcomes with subsequent surgical closure.

### A 77-year-old woman with capillary hypoxia and perioral cyanosis [^111o94Yk]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination Findings

On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vital signs revealed a heart rate of 70 beats/min; BP, 150/79 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and an Sp 2 of 81% while receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather mask at 15 L/min. On initial examination by the medical ICU team, she was again noted to have perioral cyanosis and a grayish hue to her fingertips without clubbing. Pulmonary examination, completed with the patient received oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula at 60 L/min with an F 2 of 100%, revealed a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min and symmetric vesicular breath sounds bilaterally without any adventitious breath sounds. Her Sp 2 remained consistently in the mid-80% range during the interview and examination, and she was not in distress. She had minimal lower extremity edema, with the left lower extremity appearing slightly larger than the right lower extremity. The remainder of the examination yielded unremarkable results. The patient's venous blood appeared darker than the venous blood of a healthy control subject (Fig 1), and an arterial blood sample was also noted to be abnormally dark (Fig 2).

### A 77-year-old woman with capillary hypoxia and perioral cyanosis [^112tUyR8]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pearls

1 Cyanosis with a benign cardiopulmonary examination and a saturation gap between oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp 2) and the P 2 as measured by arterial blood gas analysis (Pa 2) should raise suspicion for dyshemoglobinemias.
2 When hemoglobin structure is altered, the oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry is not accurate.
3 Knowledge of the local laboratory's capacity for CO-oximetry is crucial to understanding which hemoglobin alterations will be directly reported and which will be reported as interference.
4 Methemoglobinemia remains both more common and more dangerous than sulfhemoglobinemia.
5 There is no specific therapy for sulfhemoglobinemia aside from removal of the offending agent, and the condition does not respond to methylene blue. Blood transfusion can be used to augment the oxygen-carrying capacity in critically ill patients.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — key findings include the following: For aortic dissection, extremity pulse differential (30% of patients, type A), the combination of severe pain, abrupt onset + pulse differential + widened mediastinum on CXR confers ≥ 80% probability of dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10%, and AR occurs in 40%–75% (type A). Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (20% patients), unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Specific clues can be helpful, and chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### Dissection of the left main coronary artery after blunt thoracic trauma: case report and literature review [^117T3zyU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 37 year-old white male presented as a trauma patient after a head-on motor vehicle collision at highway speed. The patient was the restrained driver; the driver of the other car was fatally injured at the scene. Primary survey revealed an intact airway. The patient was talking without stridor; breath sounds were equal bilaterally. Pulses were palpable in all extremities and there was no evidence of jugular venous distention. He was neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15. The patient complained of chest pressure and shortness of breath.

Initial vital signs were: systolic blood pressure 118 mmHg, pulse 99 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% with supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute. He had a thoracic contusion consistent with a seatbelt sign and his sternum was tender to palpation. Physical findings also revealed a deformity of the left ankle. He had no history of medical problems or previous chest pain. Prior to the incident his only surgery was a knee arthroscopy. He had a 30 pack-year history of smoking and drank alcohol regularly.

The trauma evaluation was completed, including cervical spine, chest and pelvis radiographs, and a trauma laboratory panel (chest radiograph, Figure 1). An electrocardiogram (Figure 2) demonstrated acute ST elevation in leads I, aVL, aVF, and V2-V5. Based on the EKG findings suggesting ischemia, cardiac enzymes were ordered and, when noted to be elevated, the decision was made to proceed with a coronary angiogram. His cardiac enzymes were elevated with a creatinine phosphokinase of 454 ng/mL (38–120 ng/mL) creatinine phosphokinase-MB 13 ng/mL (< 3 ng/mL), and troponin of 0.02 ng/mL (< 0.04). He was given aspirin, intravenous morphine and metoprolol until his pain subsided. He underwent an emergent coronary angiogram (Figure 3) that demonstrated dissection of the left main coronary artery.

A 29-year-old man crashed at high speed into another vehicle at traffic lights. He was able to get out of his van but then collapsed after running a few metres. On arrival in the emergency department he was conscious, with a pulse of 140 beats/min and blood pressure of 110/32mm Hg. He had collapsing arterial pulses and an early diastolic murmur. He had a chest radiograph (figure 1A) and a skeletal survey which demonstrated multiple fractures, involving his left hand, right femur, right calcaneus, and left first and second ribs. A CT scan of the thorax was performed with a radiological contrast agent but without gated images because of the tachycardia (Figure 1B). The blood pressure and pulse were attributed to blood loss into the right thigh. Urgent cardiology review and bedside echocardiography were requested before he had emergency orthopaedic surgery (figure 1C, D) (online supplementary video 1).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2018–314082.supp1Supplementary file 1heartjnl;105/5/398/F1F1F1Figure 1(A-D) Chest radiograph, CT thorax with contrast, parasternal long-axis transthoracic view (grey scale) and with colour flow.

### Symptomatic unilateral idiopathic giant bullous emphysema: a case report [^114tBMzi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 54-year-old woman presented with intermittent left-sided chest discomfort over 2 years. She described this symptom as a "pressure" sensation in the anterior chest which was brought on by physical strain such as heavy lifting. She also reported that this discomfort was more noticeable and severe during air travel over recent years, with discomfort peaking during the middle of the flight and easing with descent. The most recent flight-related.

Episode was particularly severe and this is what prompted her presentation. She had no dyspnoea or other symptoms of note.

On further discussion, she revealed that she had been followed-up in the respiratory outpatient clinic of a different hospital some 10 years previous for an incidentally noted large bulla in her left lung. Following 5 years of annual surveillance imaging, she was discharged as she had remained asymptomatic and the bulla had not increased in size.

She was a smoker in her youth, accumulating a 5-pack-year history and quitting before the age of 30. She had no medical history and no exposures of note. There was no family history of pneumothorax, lung or connective tissue disease.

Examination revealed no hypoxia, digital clubbing or peripheral stigmata of respiratory disease. Auscultation revealed equal bilateral air entry with normal breath sounds.

A chest X-ray was done which revealed a large bulla in the left upper zone. This was followed by a high-resolution CT of the thorax (Fig. 1) which demonstrated a large avascular, air-filled region occupying the upper half of the left hemithorax, consistent with a large bulla. A diagnosis of iGBE was made. There was compression of surrounding lung. There was no evidence of emphysematous lung disease (paraseptal or centrilobular) in the remainder of both lungs.

### Making decisions about radiological imaging in pregnancy [^114zqeRr]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Common clinical scenarios

Trauma

A 27 year old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance following a high speed road traffic collision. She is 30 weeks pregnant.

She has a Glasgow coma scale score of 15, pulse rate 125 beats/min, blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 25 breaths/min.

She has pain in the left lower chest wall and left flank and left flank guarding and bruising. She says her baby is moving normally and the obstetric team has no immediate concern about the fetus. The surgical team is called and imaging is considered. The patient wants to know about risks to her baby from CT scanning.

Trauma is the leading non-obstetric cause of maternal mortality and can also cause fetal loss, so early identification of injury is important. Consider radiology when the risk from trauma is likely to be higher than the risk from imaging.

Chest radiography and focused assessment with sonography in trauma may help to rule in some injuries (eg, pneumothorax, large volume haemoperitoneum) and expose the fetus to minimal or no radiation. However, these modalities may not rule out potentially life threatening injury, which could put the patient and fetus at risk (eg, active bleeding, organ injury, fractures).

When potentially life threatening thoracic or abdominal injury is suspected, CT scan is the imaging modality of choice and intravenous (IV) contrast is usually required (fig 1).

Fig 1
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with IV contrast) of a pregnant patient involved in a high speed road traffic accident. (a) Axial image (soft tissue windowing) showing the gravid uterus and anterior placenta (arrows), (b) axial image (bone windowing, arrows), (c) coronal image (bone windowing) showing a right sacral fracture (arrows)

Discuss with the patient the risk of missing life threatening pathology versus the relatively small risk of childhood cancer induction from CT. Table 2 gives approximate risks (note, doses, and risk in table 2 are for single scans, but trauma protocols can involve dual phase scanning). Offer reassurance that the fetus is not at definitive risk from any IV contrast administration, but because of the theoretical risk of hypothyroidism, neonatal heel prick is advised (table 1).

Once life threatening injury to the patient is excluded, consider obstetric ultrasound to look for fetal, placental, and uterine injury.

### Adolescent pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum after motor vehicle crash and ejection [^111du926]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 15 year old male was an unrestrained passenger in a high speed motor vehicle crash followed by ejection. The patient was noted to have evidence of bilateral pneumothorax upon arrival in the Emergency Department. Bilateral chest tubes were placed under sterile conditions; however, the left pneumothorax remained, and a second left chest tube was placed. Repeat chest radiographs revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium. Needle aspiration of the pericardium returned significant quantities of air, an immediate improvement in blood pressures followed. An 18-gauge triple lumen catheter was placed into the pericardial space for additional withdrawal of air via syringe. Mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of tension pneumopericardium after chest trauma. Early diagnosis is crucial, and may be found on initial chest radiographs. Computed tomography is also an effective method for evaluating the presence of air in the pericardial space and may assist in establishing the diagnosis. Tension pneumopericardium requires immediate recognition and decompression to prevent cardiac tamponade with a fatal circulation collapse, an entity that is as serious as the tamponade resulting from hemopericardium. Traumatic pneumopericardium is rare, but can be a complicated finding associated with high-speed blunt chest trauma. Patients with evidence of pneumopericardium should be closely monitored, particularly those supported by positive pressure ventilation.

### Traumatic coronary artery dissection: a case report and literature review [^114qPia1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery dissection after blunt chest trauma is a rare, life-threatening condition.

Objectives

To present a case of coronary artery dissection after blunt chest trauma and to outline the appropriate management of this condition based on a literature review.

Case Report

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with traumatic coronary artery dissection after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. She presented to the Emergency Department via ambulance within a few hours of the collision, and her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. A 12-lead electrocardiogram on arrival demonstrated anterolateral ST-segment elevation. The patient was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and she required inotropes for blood pressure support. Computed tomography imaging revealed pulmonary edema and right third and fourth rib fractures. Emergent angiography demonstrated dissection of her left main coronary artery, requiring placement of a stent.

Conclusion

Early recognition of this clinical entity with a screening electrocardiogram, and aggressive management, may result in a favorable outcome. A literature review reveals that coronary artery bypass grafting, angiography with stent placement, and conservative management may all be considered viable treatment options for this condition.

### Complete fetal transection after a motor vehicle collision [^115YqzA2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of fetal death related to maternal trauma, with rupture of the gravid uterus being one potential grave outcome.

Case

We present a case of a woman at 22 weeks of gestation who presented to the emergency department after a "high-speed" motor vehicle collision. On initial presentation, she was hemodynamically stable, and the examination was significant for midabdominal transverse ecchymosis from seatbelt trauma. A computed tomography scan identified a probable uterine rupture. Laparotomy revealed a 1,500-mL hemoperitoneum and a completely ruptured uterus requiring hysterectomy. The fetus was completely transected at the level of the midabdomen.

Conclusion

Uterine rupture is possible for gravid women involved in motor vehicle collisions.

### Life and death diagnosis [^116qPuBB]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of episodes of transient loss of consciousness can be straightforward but can also present some of the greatest diagnostic difficulties. In most circumstances, when there is uncertainty, usually when there have been only one or a few poorly observed events, it may be reasonable to admit to that uncertainty and await any further events to clarify the diagnosis. We have reason to know from bitter experience that this is not always the case and that more rigorous consideration of investigation may be justified rather than allowing the passage of time to clarify the diagnosis.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: uncommon but critical diagnoses made at the point of care [^111iAzXA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in acute care require rapid, critical decision making, often with limited clinical information. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) can aid in diagnosis by providing information that may not be evident from a patient's medical history, physical examination, and ancillary tests. Eight cases are presented in which FOCUS drastically altered the management of patient care, shortened the differential diagnosis, or allowed for the development of a definitive diagnosis. In 3 cases, diagnoses that were not initially suspected were identified by FOCUS. In the remaining cases, uncommon yet critical diagnoses were established at early stages along the patients' courses of care.

The patient's vital signs were within normal range, and physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field. Arterial blood gas analysis showed an oxygen saturation of 97%, a partial oxygen pressure of 11.7 kPa and a partial carbon dioxide pressure of 4.9 kPa. Laboratory tests demonstrated a leucocyte count of 1.5x10 9 /L, 76.8% of which were neutrophils, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 53 mm/hour and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 150.87 mg/L, suggesting the presence of an underlying inflammatory reaction. Laboratory examinations, including chemistry panels, were otherwise normal.

### Motor vehicle collision secondary to ventricular dysrhythmia: a case report of Brugada syndrome [^116XJWm6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder that increases an individual's risk for sudden cardiac death and ventricular dysrhythmias that was first described by the Brugada brothers in 1992. Brugada syndrome is characterized by an atypical electrocardiogram pattern that includes a bundle branch block and ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads.

Case Report

A 74-year-old man had a cardiac arrest at the time of a low-speed motor vehicle collision. When emergency medical services arrived, the patient was in torsades de pointes. After resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation, the patient was transferred to a Level I trauma center. He was ultimately diagnosed with Brugada syndrome after exclusion of traumatic injuries. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Brugada syndrome is still considered a "cannot miss" diagnosis in the emergency department, whether a patient presents with or without symptoms. In the mixed setting of trauma as a result of cardiac arrest, accurate diagnosis can be difficult due to the "chicken or the egg" dilemma.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — current symptoms and signs: physical examination — define data elements and permissible values for documentation. Body mass index has permissible values of Numeric, kg/m² or Unknown. Third heart sound (S3) is recorded as presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound, and fourth heart sound (S4) as presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound, with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. Heart murmur status is captured as presence of heart murmur(s), and heart murmur timing is documented as Systolic, Diastolic, Continuous, or Other. Lung (pulmonary) examination findings specify findings on auscultation of the lungs with permissible values including Clear or normal, Rales, Decreased breath sounds or dullness, Rhonchi, Wheezing, Crepitations, Pleural friction rub, Absent breath sounds, and Other findings, with example permissible value definitions such as Lungs are normal on auscultation and Abnormal breath sounds (crackles) heard on auscultation indicating inflammation, fluid, or infection of the lung.

### Rapid trauma assessment… [^1134E8ph]. Wikipedia (2012). Low credibility.

Rapid trauma assessment is a method most commonly used by emergency medical services to identify hidden and obvious injuries in a trauma victim. The goal is to identify and treat immediate threats to life that may not have been obvious during an initial assessment. After an initial assessment involving basic checks on airway, breathing and circulation, the caregiver considers things like mechanism of injury to determine if a more rapid diagnostic approach is indicated than might otherwise be used. A rapid trauma assessment should take no more than 90 seconds.

Indications for rapid trauma assessment Generally, rapid trauma assessment is indicated if:

- There was a significant mechanism of injury; OR
- The patient has an altered mental status; OR
- The medical responder suspects that the patient has multi-systems trauma If NONE of these criteria are met, the medical provider may go through a slower or more focused trauma assessment. Identifying life threats A standard rapid trauma assessment will check for each of the following life threats, and provide some forms of basic treatment. Treatment that would not be life-saving is not conducted until after the rapid trauma assessment. For each area of the body assessed, it is helpful to review them while addressing the different parts of the mnemonic "DCAP-BTLS. " This stands for: Deformities, Contusions, Abrasions, Punctures/Penetrations, Burns, Tenderness, Lacerations, and Swelling.

A rapid trauma assessment goes from head to toe to find these life threats:

- Cervical spinal injury
- Level of consciousness
- Skull fractures, crepitus, and signs of brain injury
- Airway problems such as tracheal deviation
- Penetrating trauma to the neck, distention of the jugular veins, or a break in the tracheal-bronchial tree.
- Signs of serious chest injuries, including penetrating trauma to the chest, which can cause a sucking chest wound; flail chest; tension pneumothorax; and cardiac tamponade
- Breathing problems.
- Signs of serious abdominal injuries, including evisceration; penetrating or blunt force trauma; or peritonitis from bleeding into the abdomen
- A fractured pelvis
- Bilateral femur fractures
- Lower spinal injury or any other trauma to the back See also

### Unilateral lung whiteout in children: four cases and a discussion of management [^115pzaN4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Unilateral lung whiteout is caused by several conditions, and etiologies tend to vary according to age. To elucidate the etiologies, a review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE to search for articles published between January 1985 and December 2015. The search terms included "unilateral lung whiteout" and "opaque hemithorax". The inclusion criteria for the search were articles written in English concerning patients with unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax. Exclusion criteria included case studies of unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax with no specific extractable data and articles written in a language other than English. Etiologies are summarized in Table 1. Five etiologies are the most common in all ages, but additional less common etiologies also occur, varying by age. – In our case reports, we present patients with four of the most common etiologies. Table 2 provides a summary of these 4 cases.

TABLE 1
Etiologies of Unilateral Lung Whiteout

TABLE 2
Summary of the Cases

A comparison of similarities and differences in clinical characteristics is worthy of discussion. In our first 3 cases, all of the patients were between 1 and 2 years old and presented with acute respiratory distress. All three had tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, decreased unilateral breath sounds, and decreased unilateral chest wall motion. Detailed physical examination of the chest, including not only auscultation but also inspection, palpation, and percussion, provided very helpful clues leading to elucidation of the type of intrathoracic pathology involved in the unilateral lung whiteout. Although the condition of patients presenting to the ED may be critical, physicians should make an effort to carry out a detailed physical examination. We cannot emphasize enough the importance of a focused physical examination.

A man in his 20s presented with severe left-sided chest pain, shortness of breath and acute confusion. Initial examination revealed central cyanosis, normal heart sounds, vesicular breath sounds in both lung fields and a bruised right calf. The patient reported that he had recently injured his right leg and that he had not taken medication prescribed for blood clots for several days. Peripheral oxygen saturations were 85% despite high flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed hypoxaemia. Given the history and the severe hypoxia, he was managed for pulmonary embolism initially. Closer inspection of his arterial blood results showed a methaemoglobin percentage of 20.4%. He was given intravenous methylene blue which resulted in resolution of his symptoms within 30 min. He subsequently confirmed that he was undergoing genetic testing for likely congenital methaemoglobinaemia.

Physical examination in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — a physical examination is rarely (if ever) diagnostic in COPD. Physical signs of airflow obstruction are usually not present until significant impairment of lung function has occurred, and detection based on physical examination has relatively low sensitivity and specificity. A number of physical signs, such as lung hyperinflation and cyanosis, may be present in COPD, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 65-year-old female was involved in a motor vehicle crash as a pedestrian approximately three hours prior to presentation. The patient, while walking, was struck by a mid-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) and propelled six meters. There was no evidence of crushing or dragging. She experienced a brief loss of consciousness lasting ten minutes without associated vomiting. Upon regaining consciousness, she complained of abdominal pain but denied chest pain. Her family transported her to the hospital's emergency department (ED) by private vehicle. Physical examination demonstrated that the patient was in a sem-conscious state and exhibited signs of distress. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was determined to be E3V4M5. Her blood pressure (BP) measured 80/56 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remained at 95% during the administration of 5 L/min of oxygen via a face mask. Abrasions were observed on the occipital region, left clavicle, and hip. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation findings were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness, and the patient maintained full motor strength in all extremities.

Emergency laboratory results disclosed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 81 g/L, a blood lactate level (Lac) of 3.7mmol/L, a base excess (BE) of − 4.6mmol/L, a pH of 7.33, an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, and an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 51.1 s. Immediately after admission to the ED, the patient's blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels declined. A bedside Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination showed negative findings. In strict accordance with the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the patient underwent endotracheal intubation. Restrictive fluid resuscitation was initiated, accompanied by an infusion of norepinephrine at a rate of 0.15 µg/kg/min to sustain the systolic blood pressure at 80 mmHg.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- seizures

- high serum lactate

- cardiac arrest

- cardiac dysfunction not immediately explainable by the results of acute investigations

- respiratory arrest

- altered consciousness.

Case report

A previously healthy right-handed 20 year old woman sustained multiple injuries following a rollover motor vehicle collision. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, but deteriorated to 3 on scene. Her vehicle was found overturned. She was belted into the driver's seat with the shoulder belt compressing her neck. Her face was cyanotic. She was intubated on scene and transferred to hospital.

In the emergency department, her temperature was 35.7°C, blood pressure 112/66, heart rate 108 and oxygen saturation on 50% FiO₂ was 98%. Pupils were 3 mm equal and reactive. Minimal withdrawal to pain in the lower extremities was noted. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric with equivocal plantar responses.

Initial laboratory investigations were normal. Injuries identified included a burst fracture of the 6 th and 7 th cervical vertebral bodies with canal narrowing of 50%, subluxation of the right 3 rd cervical facet joint, and a right occipital condyle fracture. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head demonstrated a hypodensity in the left cerebellum. CT angiography revealed a dissection at C3 and complete occlusion at C7 of the right vertebral artery.

### Case reports of atrial and pericardial rupture from blunt cardiac trauma [^113fLWVr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt cardiac trauma is diagnosed in less than 10% of trauma patients and covers the range of severity from clinically insignificant myocardial contusions to lethal multi-chamber cardiac rupture. The most common mechanisms of injury include: motor vehicle collisions (MVC), pedestrians struck by motor vehicles and falls from significant heights. A severe complication from blunt cardiac trauma is cardiac chamber rupture with pericardial tear. It is an exceedingly rare diagnosis. A retrospective review identified only 0.002% of all trauma patients presented with this condition. Most patients with atrial rupture do not survive transport to the hospital and upon arrival diagnosis remains difficult.

Case presentation

We present two cases of atrial and pericardial rupture. The first case is a 33-year-old female involved in a MVC, who presented unresponsive, hypotensive and tachycardic. A left sided hemothorax was diagnosed and a chest tube placed with 1200 mL of bloody output. The patient was taken to the OR emergently. Intraoperatively, a laceration in the right pericardium and a 3 cm defect in the anterior, right atrium were identified. Despite measures to control hemorrhage and resuscitate the patient, the patient did not survive.

The second case is a 58-year-old male involved in a high-speed MVC. Similar to the first case, the patient presented unresponsive, hypotensive and tachycardic with a left sided hemothorax. A chest tube was placed with 900 mL of bloody output. Based on the output and ongoing resuscitation requirements, the patient was taken to the OR. Intraoperatively, a 15 cm anterior pericardial laceration was identified. Through the defect, there was brisk bleeding from a 1 cm laceration on the left atrial appendage. The injury was debrided and repaired using a running 3–0 polypropylene suture over a Satinsky clamp. The patient eventually recovered and was discharged home.

Conclusions

We present two cases of uncontained atrial and pericardial rupture from blunt cardiac trauma. Contained ruptures with an intact pericardium present as a cardiac tamponade while uncontained ruptures present with hemomediastinum or hemothorax. A high degree of suspicion is required to rapidly diagnose and perform the cardiorrhaphy to offer the best chance at survival.

### 'Long COVID' syndrome [^116jXbCu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and an unprecedented public health crisis. Recent literature suggests the emergence of a novel syndrome known as 'long COVID', a term used to describe a diverse set of symptoms that persist after a minimum of 4 weeks from the onset of a diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Common symptoms include persistent breathlessness, fatigue and cough. Other symptoms reported include chest pain, palpitations, neurological and cognitive deficits, rashes, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. We present a complex case of a previously well 28-year-old woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19. After resolution of her acute symptoms, she continued to experience retrosternal discomfort, shortness of breath, poor memory and severe myalgia. Investigations yielded no significant findings. Given no alternative diagnosis, she was diagnosed with 'long COVID'.

### Hamman's sign and syndrome: a reminder of important clinical clues [^115gq6YC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon condition in pediatrics with a peak incidence in adolescence. The most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is chest pain; however, most patients are asymptomatic. Hamman's sign is a rare but pathognomonic sign of pneumomediastinum. This clinical sign is characterized by a crunching, rasping sound, synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium. Hamman's syndrome is a SPM associated with subcutaneous emphysema.

Case Description

We report the case of a previously healthy 15-year-old adolescent male, an elite athlete, who was admitted to hospital with a 3-day history of chest pain. There was no history of previous respiratory infections, invasive procedures, or trauma. On physical examination, he had a palpable subcutaneous neck edema and a crackle on cardiac auscultation. Chest and neck radiographs confirmed ectopic air in the mediastinum and subcutaneous neck emphysema. Given the identification of Hamman's sign and the presence of emphysema, the diagnosis of Hamman's syndrome was made and symptomatic treatment was given with complete resolution.

Conclusion

This case highlights the value of physical examination and medical semiology in the diagnosis of Hamman's syndrome, especially in the presence of the pathognomonic Hamman's sign.

The clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of the following, including cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness. If event criteria are present, perform appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if no explanation for the event is identified, diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made, whereas if an explanation for the event is identified (eg, GER, feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^112mddu1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Data about COVID-19 in the infant population is scarce. Less than 1% of patients in a review of over 72,000 cases from China were younger than 10 years of age, and less than 20% of a pediatric subset were younger than 1 year of age. There is contradictory evidence regarding vertical transmission of COVID-19 between infected mothers and newborns, though the current consensus is that vertical transmission is unlikely to occur. Symptoms in this age group vary as with older age groups. A case series of nine hospitalized patients under the age of one noted that most hospitalized patients were symptomatic with fever and upper respiratory symptoms. Another reported case described a 55-day-old infant who developed more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, and demonstrated evidence of liver and cardiac injury.

In younger populations, viral load may persist for weeks regardless of symptoms, as case reports have noted persistently positive PCR tests even in asymptomatic patients, including in a well 6-month-old who tested positive for 16 days. As our patient's immediate family members were sick one week prior to the onset of his symptoms, his family was the likely source from which he contracted the virus. He tested positive on admission for both hospitalizations via PCR testing, with 21 days between the two tests.

Our patient's presentation, initially for an isolated episode of perioral cyanosis and apnea, was at first attributed to a BRUE. A BRUE is defined as an event lasting less than one minute without an identifiable explanation and with full resolution of symptoms, in an infant less than one year of age, and symptoms can include cyanosis. Past research has found a strong correlation between apparent life-threatening events, a less-specific diagnosis that has been replaced by the term "BRUE", and a positive respiratory viral infection test. However, given his recurrence of symptoms and new onset of stridor in the setting of a persistently positive COVID-19 PCR, his symptoms are more likely to be directly due to his infection by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the recurrence of symptoms after a prolonged asymptomatic period indicates this patient's infection appears to have followed an atypical course.

Central Message

A rare case presentation of right-sided cardiac herniation from pericardial rupture following an MVC that required volume resuscitation, early operative intervention, and pericardial patch repair.

See Commentaries on pages 378 and 380.

A previously healthy 24-year-old male patient presented to a rural hospital with hemodynamic and respiratory instability following a high-speed motor vehicle collision involving multiple fatalities. He was managed with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, bilateral chest tubes, and intubation. Chest radiography revealed dextrocardia, and a focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination was limited secondary to massive subcutaneous emphysema and the heart's abnormal anatomical location. The patient was clinically stabilized with resuscitation, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was obtained which revealed cardiac herniation into the right pleural cavity with associated torsion, pulmonary artery and venous narrowing, bilateral hemopneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, pulmonary contusions, and multiple left-sided rib fractures (Figure 1). The patient also sustained nonoperative thoracic spine fractures, a left scapular fracture, and bilateral renal and adrenal contusions. He was transferred to our trauma center and underwent an emergent bilateral anterolateral (clamshell) thoracotomy, given the cardiac herniation and ongoing blood volume output from the left chest tube (> 200 cc/h with 1.5 L of total blood loss).

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) plays a vital role in rapid diagnosis and management in emergency settings. We present a case of a 9-year-old male who presented after a high-speed motor vehicle collision with a negative focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). However, the quality assurance (QA) review raised concerns for a splenic mass. Further imaging confirmed the finding, and the patient underwent elective splenectomy, revealing a rare benign littoral cell angioma. This case illustrates the importance of QA in identifying findings during POCUS exams, the limitations of POCUS compared with comprehensive imaging, and the value of a multidisciplinary approach to pediatric trauma care.

### Blunt trauma… [^1159ne9s]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Classification Blunt abdominal trauma Blunt abdominal trauma represents 75% of all blunt trauma and is the most common example of this injury. Seventy-five percent of BAT occurs in motor vehicle crashes, in which rapid deceleration may propel the driver into the steering wheel, dashboard, or seatbelt, causing contusions in less serious cases, or rupture of internal organs from briefly increased intraluminal pressure in the more serious, depending on the force applied. Initially, there may be few indications that serious internal abdominal injury has occurred, making assessment more challenging and requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion. In rare cases, this injury has been attributed to medical techniques such as the Heimlich maneuver, attempts at CPR and manual thrusts to clear an airway. Although these are rare examples, it has been suggested that they are caused by applying excessive pressure when performing these life-saving techniques.

Finally, the occurrence of splenic rupture with mild blunt abdominal trauma in those recovering from infectious mononucleosis or 'mono' is well reported. Common signs and symptoms include something as simple as bruising, but occasionally as complicated as hypoxia, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypovolemia, and reduced cardiac output due to the way the thoracic organs may have been affected. Blunt thoracic trauma is not always visible from the outside and such internal injuries may not show signs or symptoms at the time the trauma initially occurs or even until hours after. A high degree of clinical suspicion may sometimes be required to identify such injuries, a CT scan may prove useful in such instances.

Those experiencing more obvious complications from a blunt chest injury will likely undergo a focused assessment with sonography for trauma which can reliably detect a significant amount of blood around the heart or in the lung by using a special machine that visualizes sound waves sent through the body. Only 10–15% of thoracic traumas require surgery, but they can have serious impacts on the heart, lungs, and great vessels. The most immediate life-threatening injuries that may occur include tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, cardiac tamponade, and airway obstruction/rupture. Most patients with more severe traumatic brain injury have a combination of intracranial injuries, which can include diffuse axonal injury, cerebral contusions, and intracranial bleeding, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

The recovery of brain function following a traumatic injury is highly variable and depends upon the specific intracranial injuries that occur. However, there is a significant correlation between the severity of the initial insult as well as the level of neurologic function during the initial assessment and the level of lasting neurologic deficits. Initial treatment may be targeted at reducing the intracranial pressure if there is concern for swelling or bleeding within the skull. This may require surgery, such as a hemicraniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed. Work-related accidents and vehicle crashes are also common causes. The injured extremity is examined for four major functional components which include soft tissues, nerves, vessels, and bones.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^111mry9o]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The world is in the midst of a global pandemic due to COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its novelty there is still limited knowledge about its natural history, and data regarding its effect on pediatric patients is particularly sparse compared to adult patients. From what is currently understood, in the pediatric population, particularly in younger children, morbidity and mortality rates are notably lower than the adult population. The most common clinical features of COVID-19 in children are fever, cough, and fatigue, which are symptoms also associated with numerous common respiratory tract infections. Younger patients usually require only supportive care and generally recover fully within two weeks of symptom onset, though there have been multiple anecdotal reports of COVID-19 related deaths in infants. We present a case of apnea and perioral cyanosis, initially worked up as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE), associated with COVID-19.

It demonstrates a flail chest (red arrow), narrowed pulmonary veins (blue arrow), cardiac torsion (blue cross), and pulmonary artery torsion (blue star) around the ascending aorta.

The right sided pleuropericardial defect extended adjacent to the phrenic nerve from the superior vena cava hiatus to the inferior vena cava hiatus (Figure 2 and Video 1). The heart was evaluated and found to have no contusions or lacerations. It was manually reduced with an immediate improvement in hemodynamics. The pericardial defect was under tension when the edges were approximated. Thus, the defect was repaired using a nonabsorbable Bard Ventrio polypropylene (DAVOL INC, a subsidiary of C. R. Bard, Inc, Warwick, RI) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh prosthesis using polypropylene sutures in a loose interrupted fashion (Figure 3) to reduce the risk of constriction from fluid and edema.

### Coronary artery rupture in blunt thoracic trauma: a case report and review of literature [^113RFVD8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old male, who was not known to have any risk factors for coronary artery disease, presented to the emergency department after a head-on motor vehicle collision as unrestrained driver. The patient complained of chest pain and shortness of breath. His GCS was 15/15. He was tachypneic (RR: 45 breaths/min) and tachycardic (HR: 134 beats/min). He was found to be hypotensive upon arrival (BP: 87/54 mmHg), but his blood pressure normalized following the rapid infusion of two liters of lactated Ringer's solution. Auscultation of lung fields revealed reduced breath sounds on the right side. Chest x-ray (CXR) revealed a large right-sided hemothorax. A thoracostomy tube was inserted on the right side resulting in the immediate drainage of two liters of blood. Initial focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam was negative, but the patient became hypotensive again soon after (BP: 60/40 mmHg). Repeated FAST revealed a moderate amount of fluid in the pericardial space. The patient was rushed into the operating room for thoracotomy and pericardiotomy. Induction of anesthesia was accompanied by progressive bradycardia that degenerated rapidly into asystole. A resuscitative thoracotomy (left anterolateral) revealed hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. The pericardium was intact. Pericardiotomy and evacuation of more than 200 mL of blood from the pericardium, followed by internal cardiac massage, resulted in restoration of heart activity after 3 min. With restoration of spontaneous circulation, bleeding was noticed from a small perforation in the distal LAD near the apex. The distal LAD was ligated proximal to the site of perforation. The left anterolateral thoracotomy was extended across the midline to the right side into a clamshell thoracotomy to allow for proper exploration of the right hemithorax. The bleeding was found to arise from multiple injured intercostal vessels, and hemostasis was secured. The blood pressure started to improve, and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation.

*Two centers were not included in this high-speed subset analysis as they did not capture data on the speed of motor vehicle collision. † p -values are from chi-square tests unless noted otherwise

A similar rate of overall in-hospital procedures was observed, although there was variability in cesarean hysterectomies performed (0.0–75.0%, p = 0.01). In fact, all the previously mentioned cesarean hysterectomies were performed in this high-speed MVC cohort. Similarly, to the overall MVC population, there were no differences in the rate of fetal delivery (0.0–14.3%, p = 0.95) and ICU LOS among centers. However, there was variation in overall LOS (1.1–5.7 days, p < 0.001) and ventilator days (0.0–0.5 days, p = 0.03), as was seen in the overall MVC population. No differences in mortality were observed among centers (0.0–4.2%, p = 0.14) (Table 6).

### Atypical profile of aortic injury associated with blunt trauma in the metropolitan area of Japan [^112ZowUR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the past 10 years, we have experienced 19 cases of aortic injury transferred to the ER. The average age was 63.5 years. Eleven patients died almost immediately at the scene, and eight patients were alive on arrival (42.1%). Interestingly, the main cause of injury was fall (68.4%), whereas motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause in the other countries. Importantly, two patients (25%) did not show any chest symptoms initially. These facts gave us an important lesson that blunt traumas need extraordinary caution for diagnosis and treatment of elderly populations.

### A case of pseudocyanosis [^113kqPin]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Cyanosis is an ominous physical sign indicating significant cardiac or respiratory disease. However, bluish discolouration mimicking cyanosis could occur in methaemoglobinaemia. The clinical implications being very different, it is important that the aetiology of bluish discolouration of tissues is correctly identified. A case is reported where the antianginal agent nicorandil was identified as the most likely cause for methaemoglobinaemia.

OVERDOSAGE

Signs and Symptoms

Serious overdosage of morphine is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and, sometimes, bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death may occur.

Treatment

Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against the respiratory depression that may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics. Therefore, an appropriate dose of the antagonist should be administered, preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of morphine may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance, and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration.

Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

### Primary mitochondrial disease as a rare cause of unclear breathlessness and distinctive performance degradation-a case report [^115PtW4r]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of unclear exertional dyspnea with extreme functional limitation.

She had experienced breathing difficulties and performance limitations since early childhood. A medical examination at 6 years of age had shown tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a normal electrocardiogram. Subsequently, her symptoms had worsened and she had developed severe pain and increasing weakness in her leg muscles. At 15 years of age, she was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma. At 16 years of age, she underwent low-stress ergometry, which caused a sharp increase in heart rate there (a sharp increase in already at 20 watts from 100 to 160/min and at 60 watts to 200/min) with extreme shortness of breath. In CPET (bicycle, 3 min at 25 watts followed by 3 min at 50 watts), the respiratory quotient at rest was 1.02 and oxygen uptake (VO 2) increased from 1.76 ml/min/kg to a maximum of 13.8 ml/kg/min. Echocardiography showed mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, which declined after 3 years of beta-blocker therapy. She was not under beta-blocker therapy when referred to our department.

### Contemporary management strategies of blunt tracheobronchial injuries [^1134QPxL]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheobronchial injuries are rare but feasibly life-threatening conditions. A prompt diagnosis and early management can be lifesaving. Due to the unspecific symptoms and indirect radiological signs the diagnosis often delays.

Objectives

We present a short series of patients suffering from tracheobronchial airway laceration. All the three patients had blunt thoracic or neck trauma and showed early signs of tracheobronchial injury. In the first case a 44-year-old woman was crushed by a bus. Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax on chest computed tomography and hypoxaemia despite of chest tube suggested the presence of an airway injury. During operation a 4-cm-long tear of the trachea and a complete transection of the right main bronchus were found. In the second case a 12-year-old girl was crossed by a truck trailer. Early signs were respiratory failure, extended subcutaneous emphysema, blood clot in the larynx, pneumothorax on both sides. Chest CT showed pneumomediastinum. During the operation a longitudinal laceration was found separating the two main bronchi at the bifurcation. In the third case a 9-year-old boy was injured in a car accident, when the seat-belt crossed his neck. Spreading subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum and an overinflated endotracheal tube's cuff were found on CT. A completely transected trachea between the first and second tracheal rings was found. All three patients required fast intubation and bronchoscopic examination to confirm the diagnosis, and to identify the site of lacerations. All the patients underwent primary reconstruction and recovered successfully.

Conclusions

In case of suspected tracheobronchial injury, a high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis. Most commonly respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are found on physical examination. Prompt intubation below the site of the injury and early laryngo- or bronchoscopic examination have priority, as we did in our cases. A primary anastomosis is required with minimal resection during urgent operation. A better outcome is to be expected when extubation is done early after surgery. We offer ordinal steps that should be taken to lead to a prompt management and good long-term outcome based on the literature and our experiences.

### When your patient clicks: a loud clicking sound as a key sign to the diagnosis [^1168gMLa]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old male patient was referred by his general practitioner with a new 'cardiac murmur'. For 1week, he had been able to provoke a clicking sound, which was in time with his heart beat and originated from his chest. The physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. The sound was initially interpreted as most likely due to a valve condition such as mitral valve prolapse, but a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. A cardiac CT was obtained, which showed left-sided ventral pneumothorax. The Hamman's sign is a loud precordial pulse synchronous sound, which is often postural. It is pathognomonic for left-sided pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Hamman's sign as a presenting symptom is rare, but if present is key to diagnosis. The awareness of rare clinical findings is important and will prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Current symptoms and signs: physical examination — respiratory auscultatory findings are defined for data capture. Wheezing is described as abnormal breath sounds characterized by a high-pitched, whistling sounds during breathing, and end-expiratory wheezes may indicate bronchospasm. Crepitations are defined as crackling sounds heard usually in lung infection or with pulmonary fibrosis. Pleural friction rub is defined as an abnormal lung sound that is caused by inflammation of the pleural layer of the lungs rubbing together; it is heard on inspiration and expiration and sounds like a low-pitch harsh/ grating noise. Absent breath sounds are defined as absence of breath sounds during auscultation.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115qXFxL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that "dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it", explains that "Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning", and concludes, "Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report". It further clarifies, "Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions", and that "Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality".

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^114cXoSy]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing evidence demonstrating children have more mild presentations and better outcomes in COVID-19 infections, there is limited documentation of individual cases, especially infants, in the medical literature. Since children appear to most commonly present asymptomatically or mildly symptomatic, they have the potential to serve as undetected vectors of the disease as cities and countries start to loosen restrictions on commerce and socialization. Given the lack of universal testing infrastructure worldwide, the implication therefore may be to focus on opportunities to test these patients whenever possible. With disease modeling estimating continued COVID-19 infection in the years ahead, our case highlights the need for clinicians to consider more subtle presentations in infants such as brief episodes of apnea, cyanosis, and stridor as potential catalysts to prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, caregiver testing, and/or recommending quarantine protocol.
