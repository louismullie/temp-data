## Question

How likely is this?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how likely it is that a person with a positive family history of a disease will develop that disease themselves. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "family history" captures and why it predicts risk. Then, I should verify how risk varies by disease, relative's degree of relation, and age of onset. Next, I will examine modifiers such as ancestry, environment, and polygenic background. After that, I should review penetrance concepts and why a negative family history does not exclude genetic risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical risk ranges and counseling implications, making sure I anchor estimates to the best available data and note uncertainties where evidence is limited.

> Let me first confirm what "family history" actually represents in clinical genetics and epidemiology. Family history integrates shared genetics, shared environments, and shared behaviors within families, so a positive history signals a higher likelihood of both inherited susceptibility and correlated exposures, which is why it remains one of the strongest, most actionable risk factors for many common diseases despite advances in genomics [^daba541a] [^32e780c4].

> I need to check how much family history elevates risk across diseases. For Alzheimer disease, first-degree relatives have about a 2- to 4-fold increased risk compared with the general population, and this risk amplification is consistent across multiple cohorts and guidelines, which gives a concrete anchor for counseling [^ac7b3e29]. For cardiovascular disease, family history independently increases risk, and in hypertensive individuals, a positive family history further augments risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, reinforcing its prognostic value beyond classic risk factors [^66d6872e]. For several common chronic diseases, odds ratios associated with a positive family history frequently exceed 2, indicating clinically meaningful risk elevation that can guide screening intensity and prevention strategies [^daba541a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; risk depends on who in the family is affected and how many. I should confirm the gradient by degree of relation. Risk is highest with affected first-degree relatives, lower with second-degree relatives, and further diluted with more distant relatives, reflecting both the average proportion of shared genome and shared environments. This gradient is well described in cardiovascular and cancer risk literature and is reflected in guideline criteria that weight first- and second-degree relatives differently [^76d7a1c1] [^0febb148]. Let me verify concordance data: among first-degree relatives of individuals with high polygenic risk scores, about one-third also have high PRS, whereas among second-degree relatives it is closer to one-fifth, illustrating the expected dilution with genetic distance [^808099b4].

> Next, I should review age of onset and family structure effects. Early-onset disease in relatives, especially before age 50, materially increases risk, and simulation work shows that penetrance, family size, and reproductive patterns explain much of the variance in observed family history density. Importantly, even carriers of high-penetrance variants may have few or no affected relatives, so a negative family history cannot safely exclude risk, particularly in small families or with sex-limited expression [^a1e831bf]. Wait, let me verify a common pitfall: I initially thought "no family history means no risk", but that is incorrect; lack of affected relatives can reflect reduced penetrance, small family size, de novo mutations, or incomplete ascertainment, not absence of genetic risk [^a1e831bf] [^b5f84aef].

> I will now examine modifiers that shift baseline risk up or down. Ancestry and population background matter because allele frequencies and environmental exposures differ, so a given family history pattern may carry different absolute risks in different populations. Environmental and behavioral factors shared within families, such as diet, smoking, and activity, also modulate expression of genetic risk, which is why counseling must address modifiable factors even when family history is positive [^daba541a] [^32e780c4]. But wait, what if we consider polygenic risk scores alongside family history? PRS and family history are largely independent and complementary, meaning PRS can refine risk when family history is limited or equivocal, though PRS performance varies by ancestry and is not a substitute for monogenic evaluation when a syndrome is suspected [^781088e7] [^b23f7b38].

> Let me think about penetrance and why estimates from familial cohorts may not translate to individuals without a family history. Penetrance estimates derived from affected families are often higher than in unselected populations, and evidence for penetrance in individuals without a family history is sparse and heterogeneous, so I should be cautious about extrapolating lifetime risks from familial data to asymptomatic individuals with a negative family history. This is precisely why population-based penetrance estimates are increasingly emphasized for secondary findings and cascade screening decisions [^b5f84aef] [^60dc469a]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies clinically: yes, guidelines for secondary findings and population screening now call for age- and sex-stratified, population-derived penetrance estimates to better calibrate risk and management recommendations [^60dc469a].

> I should double-check the practical risk ranges so counseling is concrete. For Alzheimer disease, first-degree relatives have roughly a 20–30% lifetime risk compared with about 10–12% in the general population, reflecting a 2- to 4-fold relative increase. For cardiovascular disease, family history roughly doubles risk, and in some high-risk subgroups the absolute risk difference is even larger. For several hereditary cancer syndromes, first-degree relatives carry about a 50% chance of carrying the familial pathogenic variant, though penetrance for the cancer phenotype varies by gene and age, which is why cascade testing and age-tailored surveillance are standard [^ac7b3e29] [^66d6872e] [^1e093712]. Let me reconsider whether these figures align with contemporary data: yes, these ranges are consistent with modern cohorts and guideline summaries used in primary care and specialty settings [^daba541a] [^0febb148].

> Next, I should review counseling and management implications so the risk estimate leads to action. A positive family history should trigger more intensive screening or earlier initiation of screening for conditions like colorectal, breast, and cardiovascular disease, and it should prompt consideration of genetic counseling and, when appropriate, targeted genetic testing, especially when there are red flags such as early onset, multiple affected relatives, or multisystem features. Guidelines across oncology, gastroenterology, and cardiology endorse structured family history assessment and referral pathways to genetics when criteria are met [^0febb148] [^a5006e20] [^532d4a37]. I need to ensure I emphasize that PRS can complement but not replace monogenic testing when a syndrome is suspected, and that results must be interpreted in clinical context with attention to ancestry, age, and evolving evidence [^9879c606] [^b23f7b38].

> Finally, I should synthesize a cautious, clinically useful answer to "how likely is this?" Given a positive family history, the likelihood of developing the same disease is increased by about 2- to 4-fold for many common conditions, with higher relative risks for early-onset or multiplex family patterns and lower risks when only distant relatives are affected. Absolute risks vary widely by disease, age, sex, and ancestry, and a negative family history does not eliminate genetic risk, so individualized counseling and, when indicated, genetic evaluation remain essential to refine estimates and guide prevention [^daba541a] [^a1e831bf] [^b5f84aef].

The likelihood of developing a disease with a family history depends on the **specific disease**, **degree of relation**, and **family structure**. For many common diseases, a first-degree family history roughly **doubles risk** (OR ~2) [^daba541a], with higher risks for early-onset or multiple affected relatives [^c83a7ea6]. For monogenic conditions, risk is **predictable by Mendelian inheritance** (e.g. 50% for autosomal dominant, 25% for recessive) [^1e093712]. Family history is most informative when detailed and updated, and remains a cornerstone of risk assessment even as genetic testing advances [^daba541a] [^781088e7].

---

## General principles of risk assessment

Family history reflects **shared genetics, environment, and behaviors** [^32e780c4]; thus, it captures both monogenic and polygenic risk, as well as shared exposures. Risk increases with the number of affected relatives, their closeness, and the age of onset; early-onset disease in first-degree relatives confers the highest risk [^c83a7ea6].

---

## Specific diseases and risk estimates

| **Disease** | **Risk estimate with family history** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular disease (CVD) | 2–3-fold increase | - Independent of traditional risk factors [^76d7a1c1] <br/> - Higher with early-onset CVD in relatives [^notfound] |
| Type 2 diabetes | 2–3-fold increase | - Stronger with multiple affected relatives <br/> - Early-onset diabetes increases risk [^notfound] |
| Breast cancer | 2–3-fold increase | - Higher with affected first-degree relatives <br/> - Early-onset cases further elevate risk [^notfound] |
| Colorectal cancer | 2–3-fold increase | - Higher with affected first-degree relatives <br/> - Early-onset cases further elevate risk [^notfound] |
| Alzheimer disease | 2–4-fold increase | - Higher with affected first-degree relatives <br/> - Early-onset cases further elevate risk [^ac7b3e29] |
| Monogenic disorders (e.g. BRCA, Lynch) | Predictable by Mendelian inheritance | - 50% for autosomal dominant <br/> - 25% for autosomal recessive [^1e093712] |

---

## Factors influencing risk

Several factors **modify risk** with a family history:

- **Degree of relation**: First-degree relatives confer higher risk than second-degree relatives [^c83a7ea6].
- **Number of affected relatives**: Multiple affected relatives increase risk [^a1e831bf].
- **Age of onset**: Early-onset disease in relatives increases risk [^c83a7ea6].
- **Family structure**: Small families or late-onset disease may obscure risk [^a1e831bf].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Accuracy of family history**: Self-reported history can be incomplete or inaccurate [^61ccd54e].
- **Penetrance**: Not all carriers manifest disease; penetrance varies by gene and environment [^b5f84aef].
- **Genetic testing**: May reveal monogenic risk not captured by family history, but results must be interpreted carefully [^9879c606].

---

## Clinical implications

Family history guides **screening, prevention, and counseling** [^daba541a]. Clinicians should:

- **Elicit a detailed, three-generation pedigree** when possible [^d011a802].
- **Update family history regularly** as new information arises [^280de205].
- **Use family history to tailor screening and prevention strategies** [^daba541a].
- **Refer for genetic counseling** when indicated [^0febb148].

---

Family history remains a **powerful, practical tool** for estimating disease risk, with risk typically increased about 2–3 fold for many common diseases when a first-degree relative is affected. Risk varies by disease, family structure, and age of onset, and should be integrated with genetic testing and clinical judgment to guide care [^daba541a] [^781088e7].

### The family history: the first genetic test, and still useful after all those years? [^8963f017]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The family history has its origins in genealogy and over the past century has become embedded in clinical practice. Its importance in specialized circumstances is unquestioned but largely untested. Moreover, the relevance of the family history to common diseases, especially in an era of genomic markers that convey risk and the emphasis on "personalized medicine", must be given careful scrutiny. Given the time and expertise needed to obtain and interpret the family history, without a clearer sense of clinical validity and utility, its role will likely diminish. The time to perform the requisite investigations is now.

### Family history: the three-generation pedigree [^d011a802]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The collection of a family history ranges from simply asking patients if family members have the same presenting illness to diagramming complex medical and psychosocial relationships as part of a family genogram. The three-generation pedigree provides a pictorial representation of diseases within a family and is the most efficient way to assess hereditary influences on disease. Two recent events have made family history assessment more important than ever: the completion of the Human Genome Project with resultant identification of the inherited causes of many diseases, and the establishment of national clinical practice guidelines based on systematic reviews of preventive interventions. The family history is useful in stratifying a patient's risk for rare single-gene disorders and more common diseases with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Major organizations have endorsed using standardized symbols in pedigrees to identify inherited contributions to disease.

### Evidence for penetrance in patients without a family history of disease: a systematic review [^b5f84aef]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Family-based penetrance is frequently cited as a major challenge for translating penetrance estimates from familial populations to asymptomatic populations. A systematic review was performed to assess the literature evidencing penetrance estimates in patients without a family history of disease, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Initially 1592 papers were identified, which were filtered to a final nine, through application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fundamental differences in the identified papers prevented combination of papers using meta-analysis, so thematic analysis to produce a narrative synthesis was performed. Key themes included disease risk modifiers, evidence, study limitations and bias. A methodological appraisal too was used to assess quality of included studies. It is evident from the findings that the evidence base for penetrance estimates in individuals without a family history of disease is limited. Future work is needed to refine design of penetrance studies and the impact of incorrect estimates.

### Committee opinion no. 478: family history as a risk assessment tool [^280de205]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Family history plays a critical role in assessing the risk of inherited medical conditions and single gene disorders. Several methods have been established to obtain family medical histories, including the family history questionnaire or checklist and the pedigree. The screening tool selected should be tailored to the practice setting and patient population. It is recommended that all women receive a family history evaluation as a screening tool for inherited risk. Family history information should be reviewed and updated regularly, especially when there are significant changes to family history. Where appropriate, further evaluation should be considered for positive responses, with referral to genetic testing and counseling as needed.

### Family health history: underused for actionable risk assessment [^daba541a]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Family health history (FHH) is the most useful means of assessing risk for common chronic diseases. The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly. Software that allows integration of FHH with the electronic medical record and clinical decision support capabilities has provided solutions to many of these challenges. Patient facing, electronic medical record, and web-enabled FHH platforms have been developed, and can provide greater identification of risk compared with conventional FHH ascertainment in primary care. FHH, along with cascade screening, can be an important component of population health management approaches to overall reduction of risk.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^532d4a37]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### The effect of disease penetrance, family size, and age of onset on family history with application to setting eligibility criteria for genetic testing [^a1e831bf]. Familial Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The concept of family history of disease has been used as a surrogate for genetic susceptibility in many epidemiological studies and has also been important as a criterion for selecting individuals for genetic testing. However, little is known about the precise interplay between the true genetic model (genotype-specific penetrances, age of onset distribution), life expectancy, and reproductive patterns in determining the level of family history. In order to address these questions, we performed a simulation study to address these relationships. Factors examined were the age-, sex-, and genotype-specific penetrance of the disease and the distribution of the number of offspring per family. When considering the average number of affected individuals among first-degree relatives of mutation positive probands, penetrance-related factors accounted for 64% of the variance in the average number of affected first-degree relatives, and 58% of the variance in the number of affected first- or second-degree relatives. In general, the average proportion of mutation-positive probands with at least one affected first-degree relative was low, especially for a sex-limited disease, ranging between 20% and 46%, depending on the lifetime penetrance in mutation carriers. Lack of family history among first-degree relatives of mutation positive probands is not necessarily unexpected even for loci conferring relatively high lifetime risk. In selecting probands for genetic testing, we found that under a wide variety of conditions, criteria based on the number of affected among first- and second-degree relatives were superior to those based on first-degree family history alone.

Concordance of high polygenic risk in relatives

Lastly, we assessed concordance — detection of a high PRS among first- and second-degree relatives, relevant for cascade screening in relatives of individuals with high PRS. We evaluated two questions: (1) "What is the probability of having high PRS, if a relative has high PRS?" and (2) "How does this probability differ with relative's disease status?" For (1), on average 33.7% of the first-degree and 19.8% of second-degree relatives had a similarly high PRS (Figures S7 and S8). For (2), the concordance was somewhat higher with positive FH 1st than with negative FH 1st, with an average difference of 2.5% (range 0.0%–7.9%). For FH 2nd, no difference with disease status was observed (average 0.6%).

### A pediatric approach to family history of cardiovascular disease: diagnosis, risk assessment, and management [^3e3c5c28]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The medical family history is a comprehensive and dynamic record of illnesses and other pertinent health information among family members. Family history is used to facilitate diagnosis, to identify family members at risk for developing a particular disease, and increasingly to manage disease. This article reviews the application of family history to pediatric cardiovascular disease. As more is learned about the genetic basis of cardiovascular disease, the family history will play an increasingly central role in management. Improved understanding of the causes of pediatric cardiovascular disease promises the opportunity to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Genetic risk prediction in complex disease [^88dbcf15]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Attempting to classify patients into high or low risk for disease onset or outcomes is one of the cornerstones of epidemiology. For some (but by no means all) diseases, clinically usable risk prediction can be performed using classical risk factors such as body mass index, lipid levels, smoking status, family history and, under certain circumstances, genetics (e.g. BRCA1/2 in breast cancer). The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has led to the discovery of common risk loci for the majority of common diseases. These discoveries raise the possibility of using these variants for risk prediction in a clinical setting. We discuss the different ways in which the predictive accuracy of these loci can be measured, and survey the predictive accuracy of GWAS variants for 18 common diseases. We show that predictive accuracy from genetic models varies greatly across diseases, but that the range is similar to that of non-genetic risk-prediction models. We discuss what factors drive differences in predictive accuracy, and how much value these predictions add over classical predictive tests. We also review the uses and pitfalls of idealized models of risk prediction. Finally, we look forward towards possible future clinical implementation of genetic risk prediction, and discuss realistic expectations for future utility.

### Relative risk for Alzheimer disease based on complete family history [^275bdfd5]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD), a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the major cause of dementia and carries a great financial and societal burden in the United States, has well-recognized inherited factors. Mutations in 3 genes explain most cases of autosomal dominant young-onset familial AD (amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 and -2), but mutations in these genes represent < 5% of AD cases. Most patients lack family history suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance and are considered sporadic. At least one copy of the ε4 allele of the APOE gene is found in 56% of AD cases, increasing risk 3-fold; 2 copies are found in 11% of AD cases, increasing risk 8- to 12-fold. Genome-wide association studies have identified additional variants that increase risk. About 53% of AD risk variance is accounted for by genetic variation as measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms. There is growing evidence that polygenic approaches to understanding disease risk have value.

It is now recognized that family history is an important risk indicator, but most risk prediction studies focus on close relatives, and most clinicians consider history of dementia only in immediate family members. A broader view of family history could allow individualized determination of risk and more accurate diagnosis that could help guide patients in making health-related decisions. Here an extensive resource linking genealogy with death certificates was used to provide individualized estimates of AD risk based on specific levels of family history for AD.

### Systematic comparison of family history and polygenic risk across 24 common diseases [^781088e7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

The algorithmic developments and rapid growth in genome-wide genetic testing provide a more personalized approach for measuring genetic susceptibility through polygenic risk scores (PRSs). PRSs employ information from large-scale genetic screens comparing allele frequencies in thousands of individuals with a disease to healthy controls and have identified numerous genetic loci for virtually all common diseases. To estimate polygenic risks, the common genetic variation and the effects on the disease risks are integrated into a single metric, the PRS. The effectiveness of PRSs in risk stratification has been demonstrated for many diseases, with predictive value demonstrated alongside established clinical risk assessment tools. Similarly, PRSs modify risk among individuals with high-risk variants and identify high-risk individuals for whom existing prediction tools are suboptimal.,

Given the initial expense of implementing PRS estimation in a clinical setting relative to the seemingly simple questions pertaining to family history, systematic evaluation of the independent added benefit of PRS across common diseases is essential. Studies on individual diseases have observed fairly independent effects of PRS and first-degree FH, but few studies have systematically compared the relative contributions and overlap of PRS and FH across different types of familial risk, across varying genetic architectures, and across a wide range of diseases. Moreover, only a few studies have used genome-wide PRSs, although these contemporary PRSs containing a large number of variants have demonstrated improved performance beyond PRSs with less variants due to high polygenicity in common diseases. Here we study the interplay of first- and second-degree FH, parental causes of death, and genome-wide PRSs for 24 diseases using FinnGen (N = 306,418), showing that FH and PRSs are largely independent and provide complementary information in risk assessment.

### When genetic burden reaches threshold [^b355775e]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

These new insights into the genetics of rare cardiac diseases also compel us to re-evaluate the aetiology of genotype-negative disease and the clinical management of such cases. The majority of such cases, especially in families with no prior history of disease, are likely to be caused by a range of small to intermediate effect variants and non-genetic factors. Consequently, the risk to family members is likely substantially lower than in pedigrees with penetrant Mendelian variants, such that guidelines for cardiomyopathies might soon consider it feasible to release currently phenotype-negative relatives from ongoing clinical screening. The further development of disease-specific genome-wide risk scores could aid in this decision making by quantifying the risk to relatives through inexpensive genotyping assays. Questions also arise as to how these conditions are defined — are these cases in fact the extreme end of population polygenic risk whose phenotypes converge with Mendelian diseases? Finally, it has become evident that the language and dichotomous classifications that are pervasive in genetic disease (Mendelian/complex disease, pathogenic/benign variants) are increasingly inadequate for describing the genetic basis and risk of disease. Developments in understanding genetic cardiac disease over the next few years are likely to reveal ever increasing complexity but yield improvements in risk prediction for patients and their families.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^9879c606]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) versus monogenic testing — use of PRS alone is inappropriate when a single-gene etiology is suspected. Isolated PRS testing is not the appropriate test for clinical scenarios in which monogenic etiology is known or suspected. Clinicians could misattribute a polygenic etiology to individuals with monogenic forms of common disease, so it is important to clearly define the target population and purpose of testing. If an individual's phenotype or family history fits a pattern consistent with a monogenic etiology and specific testing is available, monogenic testing should be performed instead of, or in addition to, PRS, because PRS testing alone could miss opportunities for disease prediction and targeted evidence-based risk management; clinical genetic specialists can facilitate optimal evaluations and testing strategies.

### Who to enroll in parkinson disease prevention trials? The case for genetically at-risk cohorts [^2f0476c3]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Solution 2: Overenrollment of Family Members Could Also Increase the Likelihood of Additional Genetic Modifiers and Improve Enrollment

As anticipated, because most cases with PD do not have a known attributable genetic variant, family members of affected patients with PD could not be included in prevention trials in most populations. However, enrolling carriers of known risk variants who additionally have a family history of PD may help address the challenge of reduced penetrance because a positive family history is a known risk factor for the development of PD and specifically is associated with an increased penetrance of GBA1 mutations. In addition, positive prodromal PD markers may be more frequent, even in variant family members, as seen with abnormal transcranial sonography in nonaffected family members of patients with LRRK2 -PD. Thus, a family history of PD may be used to identify the highest risk individuals to be prioritized, and oversampling could increase the likelihood of including additional modifiers of disease. Family members may also be highly motivated to participate in trials both for their own health and for the potential benefit of others because they have personally experienced the effect of disease and may be compelling advocates for research.

### How to inform at-risk relatives? Attitudes of 1379 Dutch patients, relatives, and members of the general population [^1e093712]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In hereditary diseases with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which includes the majority of hereditary cardiac, oncological, and neurological diseases, first‐degree relatives are at 50% risk of carrying the genetic predisposition (Miller, Wang, & Ware, 2013). Predictive DNA testing is possible for at‐risk relatives when a pathogenic variant is identified in the proband (the first affected person in the family in whom a DNA test is performed). It is important to allow genotype‐positive relatives to participate in preventive management strategies when available (Miller et al. 2013). Predictive DNA testing also allows at‐risk relatives to make informed decisions regarding life choices and to consider their reproductive options in case of a child wish. Genotype‐negative relatives can be reassured about disease risk in themselves and their offspring (Miller et al. 2013).

### A cancer predisposition screening tool for young adults with cancer [^597e329f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

One in twelve malignancies is diagnosed in a young adult between 20 and 39years of age. One of the most relevant known causes of cancer in this age group, which is present in approximately 10% of cancer patients, is genetic cancer predisposition that originates from constitutional or postzygotic somatic (epi-)genetic variants leading to an increased cancer risk compared to the general population. The diagnosis of a cancer predisposition syndrome is important as it can affect cancer surveillance, prevention, and therapy. Universal gene-panel germline sequencing is offered by some centers, however, in clinical settings with limited resources, cancer predisposition syndrome screening tools can support the identification of those cancer patients who may benefit from genetic counselling and/or testing regarding underlying genetic diseases. Effective screening tools have been developed for children with cancer, but comparable cancer predisposition syndrome screening algorithms are lacking for young adults with cancer. We present here an easy-to-use cancer predisposition syndrome screening tool designed specifically for young adults with cancer. By combining available recommendations and disease-specific criteria, the algorithm is focusing on somatic genetic findings in malignant cells, specific cancer types strongly associated with cancer predisposition syndromes, and the personal and family past medical history. This tool may increase clinical awareness among oncologists and facilitate the diagnoses of cancer predisposition syndromes in young adults with cancer.

### The role of genetics in pancreatitis [^5bb66ceb]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis may have an inherited predisposition to the development of the disease. Pancreatitis in the setting of a significant family history of the disease can be classified as hereditary or familial pancreatitis. In this article, the authors closely examine the specific genes implicated in pancreatitis, investigate the role of genetic testing for diagnosis, and describe the impact of genetic testing results on clinical management.

### Family history in primary care pediatrics [^a2692a6c]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The family history has been called the first genetic test; it was a core element of primary care long before the current wave of genetics technologies and services became clinically relevant. Risk assessment based on family history allows providers to personalize and prioritize health messages, shifts the focus of health care from treatment to prevention, and can empower individuals and families to be stewards of their own health. In a world of rising health care costs, the family history is an important tool, with its primary cost being the clinician's time. However, a recent National Institutes of Health conference highlighted the lack of substantive evidence to support the clinical utility of family histories. Annual collection of a comprehensive 3-generation family history has been held up as the gold standard for practice. However, interval family histories targeted to symptoms and family histories tailored to a child's life stage (ie, age-based health) may be important and underappreciated methods of collecting family history that yield clinically actionable data and supplement existing family history information. In this article, we review the various applications, as well as capabilities and limitations, of the family history for primary care providers.

### Risk prediction of complex diseases from family history and known susceptibility loci, with applications for cancer screening [^c83a7ea6]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Risk prediction based on genomic profiles has raised a lot of attention recently. However, family history is usually ignored in genetic risk prediction. In this study we proposed a statistical framework for risk prediction given an individual's genotype profile and family history. Genotype information about the relatives can also be incorporated. We allow risk prediction given the current age and follow-up period and consider competing risks of mortality. The framework allows easy extension to any family size and structure. In addition, the predicted risk at any percentile and the risk distribution graphs can be computed analytically. We applied the method to risk prediction for breast and prostate cancers by using known susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies. For breast cancer, in the population the 10-year risk at age 50 ranged from 1.1% at the 5th percentile to 4.7% at the 95th percentile. If we consider the average 10-year risk at age 50 (2.39%) as the threshold for screening, the screening age ranged from 62 at the 20th percentile to 38 at the 95th percentile (and some never reach the threshold). For women with one affected first-degree relative, the 10-year risks ranged from 2.6% (at the 5th percentile) to 8.1% (at the 95th percentile). For prostate cancer, the corresponding 10-year risks at age 60 varied from 1.8% to 14.9% in the population and from 4.2% to 23.2% in those with an affected first-degree relative. We suggest that for some diseases genetic testing that incorporates family history can stratify people into diverse risk categories and might be useful in targeted prevention and screening.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^a5006e20]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — genetic evaluation and management principles for hereditary gastrointestinal (GI) cancer syndromes state that the initial assessment is the collection of a family history of cancers and premalignant gastrointestinal conditions and should provide enough information to develop a preliminary determination of the risk of a familial predisposition to cancer, and that age at diagnosis and lineage (maternal and/or paternal) should be documented for all diagnoses, especially in first- and second-degree relatives. When indicated, genetic testing for a germline mutation should be done on the most informative candidate(s) identified through the family history evaluation and/or tumor analysis to confirm a diagnosis and allow for predictive testing of at-risk relatives, and genetic testing should be conducted in the context of pre- and post-test genetic counseling to ensure the patient's informed decision making. Patients who meet clinical criteria for a syndrome as well as those with identified pathogenic germline mutations should receive appropriate surveillance measures in order to minimize their overall risk of developing syndrome-specific cancers, and for each of these syndromes the guideline outlines diagnostic criteria and indications for genetic evaluation, describes the currently known associated underlying genes, and makes recommendations for surveillance and management of at-risk individuals and those found to carry a definitive disease-causing mutation across Lynch syndrome (LS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), Cowden syndrome (CS), serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, hereditary pancreatic cancer, and hereditary gastric cancer.

### Review of guidelines for the identification and clinical care of patients with genetic predisposition for hematological malignancies [^cb6f5888]. Familial Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus criteria for the identification of patients with genetic predisposition for hematologic malignancies

Since the diagnosis of familial leukemia has critical implications for the patient and for his/her family, it is important to recognize clinical features pointing towards genetic predisposition. In 2016 Jongmans et al. have described easy to use recognition criteria of genetic predisposition in pediatric cancer patients. They include (1) family history, (2) specific cancer entities, (3) somatic hints, (4) ≥ 2 malignancies, (5) congenital defects/ non-malignant signposts, (6) high/unexpected toxicity. These criteria have been updated by the German Societies of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology and Human Genetics in a questionnaire designed for use in every pediatric hematology oncology center. It is requested to take a 3-generation pedigree to evaluate the family history, to document diagnosis of neoplasms or known germline predisposition determined by genetic tumor analysis, two or more known malignancies or the presence of a child with cancer and congenital or other anomalies, and, finally, whether the patient has suffered from excessive toxicity from cancer therapy. Furthermore, these criteria include specific cancer entities, among them ALL with Robertsonian translocation rob(15;21), hypodiploid ALL, AML with monosomy 7, and MDS in general. Other features are somatic hits suggesting a germline predisposition, more than two malignancies in the diseased child, a number of defined congenital defects or high/ unexpected toxicity.

The Nordic guidelines established by the Nordic MDS group initially focused on adults with germline predisposition to myeloid neoplasms and are intended for use in clinical practice. They provide most detailed recommendations, based on the recent literature and clinical experience of the group, for the identification of individuals with genetic predisposition for hematological malignancies. These guidelines contain clear algorithms on who should be offered genetic testing based on age, family history, personal medical history, clinical/ physical findings and genetic characterization of the clonal cells, e.g. they identify patients below the age of 50 with monosomy 7, del(7q) or der(1;7) as possible candidates for familial leukemia, who should, therefore, be investigated for cancer predisposition genes. In clinical studies, it is recommended to investigate even all patients below 50 years of age (Table 1).

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^66dd8116]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Section summary — clinical utility of PGS remains largely hypothetical, with increasing research evaluating clinical outcomes; genetic counseling about the genetic contribution to complex conditions utilizes existing principles of risk communication; genetic counseling about PGS should be framed in the broader context — these are complex conditions to which both genetics and environment contribute, and PGS often does not capture all genetic risks; inheritance considerations may be needed, including that PGS and associated risk can vary widely between siblings and close relatives; and PGS is rapidly developing, and providers must stay current on disease-specific test offerings and clinical management.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^c282e935]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG — Testing in the context of Mendelian conditions: If the PRS is being used within a joint prediction model for Mendelian disease risk, there are additional challenges in validating the use of these combined tests. The target populations for testing differ, as Mendelian testing is usually done in high-risk populations with significant family history and challenges exist with testing of healthy populations and should be given careful consideration keeping in mind the potential benefits and risks. The risk information conveyed by each test type differs; Mendelian variant curation frameworks rely on an understanding of disease mechanisms, PRS describes a statistical association, and high-risk does not indicate an underlying disease pathology, and PRS is solely considered screening information. There is no clear guidance on how these different types of risk information can be accurately combined or related to one another. The predicted phenotype of a PRS may not be appropriate for Mendelian diseases. When designing reports including both monogenic high-penetrance variants and PRS in a joint model, the potential effect on medical management must be considered, and many thresholds for prophylactic action or screening recommendations are dependent on lifetime or absolute risk of disease, which are traditionally dependent on well-established risks conferred by Mendelian conditions.

### Hereditary cancer syndromes and risk assessment: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 793 [^bcb43e1c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Family and medical history screening — A hereditary cancer risk assessment is the key to identifying patients and families who may be at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. This assessment should be performed by obstetrician–gynecologists or other obstetric–gynecologic care providers and should be updated regularly, and an assessment includes information on personal and family history, including pathology, imaging reports, and evaluation of other medical risk factors for cancer. A patient intake form, which includes a review of systems and conditions that may exist in the patient or her family, is used in many office settings to gather information quickly; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee Opinion No. 478, Family History as a Risk Assessment Tool, establishes the general concept of collecting a family history and constructing a pedigree, and online versions of an intake form are available for patients and health care providers, including the Surgeon General's "My Family Health Portrait", a web-based program in which patients may create a comprehensive family history that can be shared with family and health care providers.

### How can polygenic inheritance be used in population screening for common diseases? [^346c7e04]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in genomics have near-term impact on diagnosis and management of monogenic disorders. For common complex diseases, the use of genomic information from multiple loci (polygenic model) is generally not useful for diagnosis and individual prediction. In principle, the polygenic model could be used along with other risk factors in stratified population screening to target interventions. For example, compared to age-based criterion for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening, adding polygenic risk and family history holds promise for more efficient screening with earlier start and/or increased frequency of screening for segments of the population at higher absolute risk than an established screening threshold; and later start and/or decreased frequency of screening for segments of the population at lower risks. This approach, while promising, faces formidable challenges for building its evidence base and for its implementation in practice. Currently, it is unclear whether or not polygenic risk can contribute enough discrimination to make stratified screening worthwhile. Empirical data are lacking on population-based age-specific absolute risks combining genetic and non-genetic factors, on impact of polygenic risk genes on disease natural history, as well as information on comparative balance of benefits and harms of stratified interventions. Implementation challenges include difficulties in integration of this information in the current health-care system in the United States, the setting of appropriate risk thresholds, and ethical, legal, and social issues. In an era of direct-to-consumer availability of personal genomic information, the public health and health-care systems need to prepare for an evidence-based integration of this information into population screening.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^b23f7f38]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG statement — general considerations for clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) emphasize that PRSs are not diagnostic tests, and PRSs predict risk in healthy individuals and should not be used for the purpose of diagnosis of a genetic cause of disease, and PRS have not been designed or tested for differential diagnosis in symptomatic individuals. PRSs are distinct from monogenic tests and currently combining polygenic and monogenic risk is not always straightforward or appropriate; unless well-validated, test results from PRSs and tests of genes with large effects should be treated as distinct measures. Individual PRS should not be used to predict risk for traits or diseases in which they have not been validated. PRSs are intended for heritable common diseases and currently are not as appropriately developed to provide risk for rare diseases; even for common, but less prevalent diseases (eg, < 1% population incidence), the positive predictive value of a high-risk PRS result may be very low. PRSs can be useful in cases in which family history is limited and cases in which individuals do not carry pathogenic variants in high-penetrance genes. The harms and benefits of PRSs should be considered at the population level and benchmarked against available risk-prediction tools; laboratories and health systems need to communicate PRS performance characteristics clearly and accurately, and robust evaluation of the benefits of PRSs, cost of PRSs, and harm/benefit ratio should be done at the population scale with recommendations propagated to provider–patient encounters.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^33686a6d]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

General considerations for a health care provider when interpreting PRS emphasize that even the individual with a high disease-risk prediction by PRS may never develop the disease in question, because the PRS percentile result represents the individual's ranking of odds ratio of the lifetime disease risk in a chosen population, and similarly, individuals with low PRS predicted risk can develop the disease. PRS-related clinical risk should be understood both within an individual-specific clinical context (eg, the individual's age, medical and family history, and other clinical data) as well as within an understanding of the limitations of the test, and healthy lifestyle could play a protective role in developing a certain condition, even for individuals with high PRS results. The performance of the PRS model should be validated on a comparable test population independent from the population in which the model was generated, PRS results only deliver a risk prediction for the trait, disorder, or disease for which the specific model was generated, and monogenic etiologies for the trait, disorder, or disease addressed by the PRS are not evaluated through PRS calculations (eg, breast cancer PRS does not assess for monogenic BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk). However, PRS has been shown to be associated with a modified clinical risk level for features of monogenic conditions (eg, age of disease onset).

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^61becc99]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Variants in healthy or asymptomatic individuals or as incidental findings — caution and higher evidentiary thresholds: Caution must be exercised when using these guidelines to evaluate variants in healthy or asymptomatic individuals or to interpret incidental findings unrelated to the primary indication for testing. In these cases the likelihood of any identified variant being pathogenic may be far less than when performing disease-targeted testing, so the required evidence to call a variant pathogenic should be higher, and extra caution should be exercised; the predicted penetrance of pathogenic variants found in the absence of a phenotype or family history may be far less than predicted based on historical data from patients ascertained as having disease.

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^c9e1e737]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) prognostic implications of genetic testing — knowledge of the underlying gene and mutation has a limited role in risk assessment and management of the individual patient, which instead is based largely on clinical risk factors. Validated clinical risk factors include a family history of SCD, and patients with features of HCM but without pathogenic sarcomere mutations have a lower likelihood of a positive family history and, on average, a milder phenotype; thus, a negative genetic test may be of prognostic significance. There are only a few specific mutations that might carry a prognostic implication, and ordinarily a genetic test result in isolation will not constitute an indication for an ICD for primary prevention, and long-term efforts are needed to accumulate reliable evidence on genotype–phenotype correlations, especially those pertaining to specific mutations.

Carrier screening and genetic risk terminology — the glossary defines "Carrier Screening" as "Genetic testing performed on an asymptomatic individual to determine whether that person has a mutation or abnormal allele within a gene associated with a particular disorder", noting that "Carrier screening can be performed for one specific condition or for multiple disorders", and "Expanded Carrier Screening" as "Disease screening that evaluates an individual's carrier state for multiple conditions at once and regardless of ethnicity". Risk descriptors include "A Priori Risk: The best assessment of risk before testing results are known" and "Residual Risk: The risk that an individual is a carrier for or is affected by a disorder despite a negative screening test". "Consanguinity" is defined as "A union between two individuals who are second cousins or closer in family relationship". The glossary also defines "Susceptibility Testing" as "Determines whether an individual carries a genetic variation that increases the potential for developing a specific condition", clarifying that "Not every person with a genetic variant will develop the condition, but they are at increased risk", with "An example of susceptibility testing is BRCA testing", and it defines "Variants of Uncertain Significance" as "An identified DNA change that either cannot be characterized reliably as benign or pathogenic at the time of the study because of limited data describing outcomes in association with the changes or is associated with a variable phenotype (because of incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity)".

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^880e4040]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the management of patients with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes. The initial assessment is the collection of a family history of cancers and premalignant gastrointestinal conditions and should provide enough information to develop a preliminary determination of the risk of a familial predisposition to cancer. Age at diagnosis and lineage (maternal and/or paternal) should be documented for all diagnoses, especially in first- and second-degree relatives. When indicated, genetic testing for a germline mutation should be done on the most informative candidate(s) identified through the family history evaluation and/or tumor analysis to confirm a diagnosis and allow for predictive testing of at-risk relatives. Genetic testing should be conducted in the context of pre- and post-test genetic counseling to ensure the patient's informed decision making. Patients who meet clinical criteria for a syndrome as well as those with identified pathogenic germline mutations should receive appropriate surveillance measures in order to minimize their overall risk of developing syndrome-specific cancers. This guideline specifically discusses genetic testing and management of Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, hereditary pancreatic cancer, and hereditary gastric cancer.

### A systematic genetic assessment of 1, 433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer-predisposition genes [^e1ff7a10]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancer-predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an "average" deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100: 1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20: 1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^aab43a4f]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Common complex disorders risk alleles — Unlike Mendelian diseases, the identification of common, complex disease genes has largely relied on population-based approaches such as genome-wide association studies. Currently, numerous genome-wide association study reports have resulted in the cataloguing of over 1,200 risk alleles for common, complex diseases and traits, and most of these variants are in noncoding regions. Common, complex risk alleles typically confer low relative risk and are meager in their predictive power, and to date the utility of common, complex risk allele testing for patient care has been unclear, with models to combine multiple markers into a cumulative risk score often flawed and usually no better than traditional risk factors such as family.

### Risk prediction by genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease is independent of self-reported family history [^0a3dd655]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical perspective

Assessing risk of coronary events is integral to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, current risk assessment algorithms do not explicitly incorporate information about a patient's genetic risk. This large, population-based, prospective study of middle aged Europeans, found that genetic risk — as measured by a genetic risk score comprising dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms — is independent of traditional risk factors, including family history of cardiovascular disease.

### Linking family history in obstetric and pediatric care: assessing risk for genetic disease and birth defects [^32e780c4]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Family history captures the collective influence of shared genetic susceptibility, shared environmental factors, and common behaviors within families. Throughout the reproductive continuum, pediatricians, obstetricians, family practitioners, genetic counselors, and other clinicians can work with families to elicit relevant family history information and factor it into risk-assessment calculations and, when appropriate, decision-making. Current screening tools have focused on understanding the risk for single-gene disorders, chromosomal conditions, and teratogen exposures during the preconception, prenatal, and interconception periods. More research and data are needed to understand how family history influences risk for a wide variety of complex birth outcomes such as preterm birth, stillbirth, and many birth defects. With a better understanding of the impact of family history on many adverse birth outcomes, tools for the collection of a broader set of pertinent family history information must be developed.

### The genetic family history as a risk assessment tool in internal medicine [^4db2afca]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study goals were to (1) determine the proportion of unselected individuals at increased risk for diseases with known genetic components and (2) compare the documentation and quality of risk assessment between a questionnaire, a pedigree interview, and chart review.

Methods

Seventy-eight patients seen in a division of internal medicine were randomized into two groups, which completed a questionnaire or underwent a pedigree interview. Chart notes were compared to both study tools.

Results

Sixty-two (79.5%) of the 78 participants scored at increased risk for at least one category. Either of the two study tools found significantly more people at high risk (48/78, 61.5%) than the chart review (31/78, 39.7%) (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Approximately 20% of patients in an unselected internal medicine practice were at an increased risk that was not documented in reviewed chart notes. Targeted family history analysis reveals patients who require increased medical surveillance, preventive measures, or genetic counseling/testing.

### Consideration of disease penetrance in the selection of secondary findings gene-disease pairs: a policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^60dc469a]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Secondary findings (SF) penetrance — Population-derived penetrance data are described as "the most directly applicable to SF list consideration, although not a strict requirement for inclusion", because the most relevant scenario is an individual with a "pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant" without "previously recognized personal or family history", and population-based penetrance is "especially relevant"; ideally, estimates come from population-scale cohorts with recruitment bias acknowledged, genomic ascertainment with documented variant classification, are stratified by sex and age, are "presented with 95% confidence intervals" and clear methodology, and are linked to a specific phenotype, derived from diverse cohorts and multiple sources, including cohorts with comprehensive clinical data/testing for the gene–phenotype of interest.

### Family history assessment: strategies for prevention of cardiovascular disease [^76d7a1c1]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Family history assessment can be used to combine population-wide health promotion and risk-reduction efforts with a high-risk, targeted approach to help reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Family history is an independent predictor of CVD, and the upper portion of the family history distribution explains a larger fraction of CVD in the population than can be explained by extreme values of other risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and cholesterol). A positive family history of disease captures the underlying complexities of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions by identifying families with combinations of risk factors, both measured and unmeasured, that lead to disease expression. Family history is a useful tool for identifying most prevalent cases of CVD and for population-wide disease-prevention efforts. A positive family history also identifies the relatively small subset of families in the population at highest risk for CVD who may benefit most from targeted screening and intensive intervention.

### Secondary (additional) findings from the 100, 000 genomes project: disease manifestation, health care outcomes, and costs of disclosure [^75c22255]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We have previously reported expert views that an approach to opportunistic screening should be at variant-level, and this view is supported by evidence that penetrance is heterogeneous even within the same disease gene. Since monogenic disease expression is modified by common genetic variation, incorporating polygenic risk scores (PRS) with screening for monogenic variants might in the future increase the accuracy of risk estimation and be used to tailor genetic counselling and risk management. However, PRS are based on genome-wide association studies, in which the majority of participants are of European descent, meaning that PRS are not generalizable to globally diverse populations.

Opportunistic genomic screening is distinct from population screening, and recommendations to report secondary findings are not necessarily an endorsement of population screening in a public health context. The ACMG propose that DNA-based risk detection should be evidence-based and comply with health screening criteria, and UK guidance criteria for population screening programmes are based on the same principles. One criterion is that the 'natural history' of a condition proposed for screening should be understood, including penetrance and age of onset in individuals with a heterozygous P/LP variant; such data remain limited. Health equity is imperative for a genomic screening policy, and implementation should consider design to benefit the whole population. A targeted approach - considering age of commencement of screening and risk management for a given condition - would offer greater population benefits than opportunistic genomic screening, while minimising risk of psychological harms that might result from disclosing a disease-predisposing variant several years before screening would be offered. Given the reduced costs of genetic testing (a bespoke gene panel may be more cost-effective than genome sequencing), population genetic screening could re-focus resources at an earlier stage in disease development, with advantages for individuals and health systems. Implementation of a targeted approach would require separate considerations for cancer predisposition and FH, and while a disease-specific approach would inevitably place a burden on health services, cancer- and FH-risk are managed by appropriate care specialisms. Maximising the utility of population screening while minimising psychological harms will require genomic counselling to promote communication to relevant family members, psychological support and referral for appropriate risk assessment and management, and care in delivery to minority groups. The current under-representation of individuals without recent north European ancestry in genomic datasets presents a challenge to equitable genomic healthcare. Workforce planning and education to support delivery of preventative healthcare requires a long-term outlook.

### Germline mutations in prostate cancer: a systematic review of the evidence for personalized medicine [^4b49cf35]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The goal of precision medicine in prostate cancer (PCa) is to individualize the treatment according to the patient's germline mutation status. PCa has a very high rate of genetic predisposition compared with other cancers in men, with an estimated rate of cancers ascribable to hereditary factors of 5–15%.

Methods

A systematic search (PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov) of English literature from 2000 to 2022, using the keywords "prostate cancer", "germline mutations", "family history", and "inheritance" was conducted, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.

Results

The search identified 980 publications. Of these, 200 papers were removed before screening (duplicates, non-English literature, and publication year before 2000) and 245 records were excluded after title/abstract screening. Finally, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. We analyze the latest evidence on the genetic basis of PCa predisposition and clinical implications for more personalized screening protocols and therapeutic management of this high-prevalent cancer.

Discussion

Emerging data show that germline mutations in homologous recombination genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, CHECK2), in mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MLH2, MSH6), and other additional genes are associated with the development and aggressiveness of PCa. Germline testing and genetic counseling have increasingly important implications in cancer screening and therapeutic decisions making for patients affected by PCa. Patients with localized PCa and some gene mutations are more likely to develop aggressive cancer, so active treatment may be preferable to active surveillance for these patients. Moreover, in patients with metastatic PCa, these gene alterations may be useful biomarkers for predicting response to specific therapy such as PARP inhibitors, recently approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant PCa. The evidence supports recent guidelines and recommendations considering germline genetic testing for patients with a positive family history of PCa or men with high risk or metastatic disease.

### Assessing individual risk for AMD with genetic counseling, family history, and genetic testing [^8ae55f0e]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

PurposeThe goal was to develop a simple model for predicting the individual risk profile for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on the basis of genetic information, disease family history, and smoking habits. Patients and methodsThe study enrolled 151 AMD patients following specific clinical and environmental inclusion criteria: age > 55 years, positive family history for AMD, presence of at least one first-degree relative affected by AMD, and smoking habits. All of the samples were genotyped for rs1061170 (CFH) and rs10490924 (ARMS2) with a TaqMan assay, using a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR device. Statistical analysis was subsequently employed to calculate the real individual risk (OR) based on the genetic data (ORgn), family history (ORf), and smoking habits (ORsm). Results and conclusionThe combination of ORgn, ORf, and ORsm allowed the calculation of the Ort that represented the realistic individual risk for developing AMD. In this report, we present a computational model for the estimation of the individual risk for AMD. Moreover, we show that the average distribution of risk alleles in the general population and the knowledge of parents' genotype can be decisive to assess the real disease risk. In this contest, genetic counseling is crucial to provide the patients with an understanding of their individual risk and the availability for preventive actions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^2a431263]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Myelodysplastic syndromes — features of germline myeloid predisposition mutations note that constitutional mutations predisposing to myeloid malignancy can occur without clinical stigmata of an inherited disorder or family history due to phenotypic heterogeneity, which reflects overlapping features between inherited syndromes and also variable expressivity within a syndrome. A concerning family history of an inherited disorder is not expected in patients in whom the disease-causing mutation occurred de novo, and there can be genetic anticipation in the short telomere syndromes in which a child may be clinically affected and the genetically affected parent clinically unaffected or less severely affected. Patients harboring these constitutional mutations can present to both pediatric and adult care centers; for example, patients who are older harbor germline predisposition mutations may demonstrate longer latency for disease development, as seen with germline DDX41 mutations. Patients < 50 y with MDS and those with therapy-related myeloid malignancies may be more likely to harbor germline variants in these cancer predisposition genes.

### Genetic approaches to study rheumatic diseases and its implications in clinical practice [^040653f8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with rare and complex rheumatic diseases (RDs) present with immense clinical variability inherent to all immunologic diseases. In addition to systemic and organ-specific inflammation, patients may display features of immunodeficiency or allergy, which may represent major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The person's genetic architecture has been a well-established risk factor for patients with RDs, albeit to variable degrees. Patients with early-onset diseases and/or positive family history (FH) have a strong genetic component, whereas patients with late-onset RDs demonstrate a more complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. Overall, the genetic studies in patients with RDs have been instrumental to our understanding of innate and adaptive immunity in human health and disease. The elucidation of the molecular causes underlying rare diseases has played a major role in the identification of genes that are critical in the regulation of inflammatory responses. In addition, studies of patients with rare disorders may help determine the mechanisms of more complex autoimmune diseases by identifying variants with small effect sizes in the same genes. In contrast, studies of patients with common RDs are conducted in cohorts of patients with well-established phenotypes and ancestry-matched controls, and they aim to discover disease-related pathways that can inform the development of novel targeted therapies. Knowing the genetic cause of a disease has helped patients and families understand the disease progression and outcome. Here, we discuss the current understanding of genetic heritability and challenges in the diagnosis of RDs in patients and how this field may develop in the future.

### Genetic counseling and testing for Alzheimer disease: joint practice guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^31415e2c]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) unlikely — counseling and testing should emphasize that families be informed why their family history is consistent with familial or sporadic AD, and that both sporadic and familial cases can be due to a genetic susceptibility with risk estimates only available for first-degree relatives of an affected individual. Genetic testing for susceptibility loci (e.g. APOE) is not clinically recommended due to limited clinical utility and poor predictive value; if a patient wishes to pursue testing despite counseling, testing may be considered at the clinician's discretion, and testing performed should follow the HD genetic testing guidelines with emphasis on genetic counseling with a qualified clinician; DTC genetic testing is not advised. Motives and considerations for pursuing genetic testing should be explored, counseling should be an exploration of personal experiences, value and beliefs, and present and future family needs, and genetic testing should be discussed within the context of adapting to familial risk and when clients feel compelled to learn a more refined estimate of their risks to enhance their quality of life; as part of this, it is helpful to lead the individual through the scenario of receiving a positive test result and a negative test result, assessing how these results would impact psyche, life plans, and relationships.

### Genetic diagnosis of individuals at risk of CADASIL: prospect for future therapeutic development [^eb622a5f]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, the results of this large and independent survey showed that individuals at risk among families do not actually differ from already diagnosed subjects except their younger age and frequent childlessness. They are well informed and in close contact with CADASIL patients and do not seem to be in denial about their personal risk regarding this condition. Most often, they do not undergo genetic testing for fear of being overwhelmed by concerns related to the disease and prefer to delay such a decision to the onset of the first symptoms. Finally, it is as if people at risk put off the shift from indeterminate to patient-in-waiting until the disease makes its presence felt, even if discreetly. From that tipping point onwards, other uncertainties — about how the disease develops or what it is like to be an ill person — take the place of uncertainty about status. Reasons that could lead to a diagnostic decision other than the appearance of symptoms could then vary widely and might depend for example on the decision to become parents or on the experience of the disease in a close symptomatic relative. Finally, although the interest of subjects at risk in therapeutic development is as high as in CADASIL patients and indisputable, the influence of a possible participation in a therapeutic trial on such a decision appears ambiguous and uncertain. At first sight, such results might seem to compromise the recruitment of asymptomatic people in future clinical trials, as it would require them to engage in early diagnosis. It cannot be ruled out, however, that a more favorable scenario leading to acceptance of a proposal could take place after further reflection and in a real and very concrete situation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^ac7b3e29]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease genetic testing — scope, specific genes, and counseling guidance: Genetic testing is generally not part of the evaluation of patients with dementia except in very specific instances, and testing for apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is not recommended for use in diagnosis. First-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease have a risk of developing the disease that is two to four times that of the general population, and early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease in families has been linked to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14, and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1, with genetic testing commercially available for PSEN1 and PSEN1 likely to be found in families with dementia developing before age 50 years. The role of such testing in clinical practice has not yet been established; because no preventive treatments are currently available, testing should only be offered in the setting of thorough pre- and posttest counseling, and genetic testing is best done in conjunction with experts familiar with Alzheimer's disease genetics. Genetic counseling and sometimes genetic testing may also be appropriate for some patients with other dementias and a family history of similar syndromes, including clinical pictures suggestive of frontotemporal dementia with autosomal dominant inheritance, Huntington's disease, or CADASIL with associated Notch 3 gene polymorphisms.

### Family screening in relatives at risk for plakophilin-2-associated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^14e39d47]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disease that is most commonly caused by a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant in plakophilin-2 (PKP2). The hallmark features of the disease are sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), including sudden cardiac death. Because a familial predisposition to PKP2 -associated ARVC can be identified through genetic testing, longitudinal screening of relatives of patients with ARVC is strongly recommended. – Indeed, the current guidelines recommend initiation of screening at 10 to 12 years of age and re-evaluation with an ECG, Holter monitoring, and an imaging modality every 1 to 3 years. –

Unfortunately, the currently recommended screening algorithms do not account for genotype-specific differences in penetrance, risk of VA, or their associated risk factors.– Therefore, this one-size-fits-all family screening algorithm may result in overscreening of patients with a low likelihood of developing penetrant ARVC and underscreening of those who are at the highest risk, leading to inefficient use of clinical resources and potential missed windows of opportunity for primary prevention. Although longitudinal family screening studies have been performed previously, these studies enrolled relatives of patients with ARVC with different underlying genotypes, as well as gene-elusive families. – Thus, to date, there is limited evidence to support genotype-specific longitudinal screening algorithms.

To address this gap, we evaluated outcomes of a large cohort of relatives of patients with ARVC with P/LP PKP2 variants to develop such an algorithm. The purpose of this study was to develop a safe, evidence-based longitudinal screening algorithm for relatives with a P/LP PKP2 variant.

### Genetic testing referral rates for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in an academic tertiary centre [^1b009f07]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are neuroendocrine tumours arising from the adrenal medulla or extra‐adrenal paraganglia, respectively. Pathogenic germline variants are increasingly recognized as drivers in the development of PPGL. Many clinical criteria have been used to guide risk assessment of underlying genetic predispositions, including age of diagnosis, family history, and tumour characteristics. When we risk stratify patients using clinical criteria, individuals with either extra‐adrenal location, age of diagnosis before 45 years, multifocal tumours, and/or positive family history have the highest likelihood of having a germline mutation. However, genetic screening of large cohorts have consistently demonstrated that individuals lacking this clinical phenotype harbour a high prevalence of germline mutations in known susceptibility genes. Routine genetic testing with expanded gene panels has demonstrated that for patients with PPGL, 30%–40% can have a heritable mutation.

Given that many individuals with PPGL — even those with sporadic presentations — may have an underlying genetic predisposition, societal guidelines and consensus statements have offered recommendations for referring individuals for genetic counselling and germline testing. In 2014, the Endocrine Society published clinical practice guidelines recommending consideration for genetic testing in all patients with PPGL, weighing the individual financial costs and risks against the pretest probability. More contemporary guidelines, including those from the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS), have recommend universal genetic counselling and testing in all patients with PPGL.

The rationale for universal screening is multifactorial. First, the presence of a germline mutation is associated with higher risks of disease recurrence and metastatic disease compared to patients with sporadic disease. Second, early recognition of pathogenic mutations may influence surgical decision‐making in terms of extent of resection, providing an opportunity to improve clinical management and long‐term outcomes. Finally, mutation detection offers valuable information for guiding testing of at‐risk family members. Despite a relatively high prevalence of patients with germline predisposition syndromes and guidelines for universal genetic counselling, there remains considerable variability in the implementation of genetic testing in clinical practice. Several factors, both provider‐ and patient‐related, influence the decision for genetic testing, including provider awareness and decision‐making, access to genetic counsellors, and financial barriers.

### "Incidentally" discovered von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^e399fd40]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Historically, patients referred for genetic counseling and germline VHL testing were at risk of a known familial VHL variant, or patients with a personal or family history raising suspicion for VHL disease (eg, early-onset ccRCC [≤ 46-years-old], hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or 2+ VHL-associated lesions). This population was characterized by a referral bias based on presence of tumor(s) in the proband or their families. The prevalence (1:36 000), high penetrance (almost 97%), and expressivity of VHL disease were tabulated based on this referral bias.

Here, we describe 6 patients incidentally discovered to carry germline pathogenic VHL mutations, presenting to our institution over the last 2 years. Standard VHL imaging revealed no evidence of VHL tumors at presentation. For such unsuspected VHL germline variants without clinical stigmata of VHL disease, we coin the term "incidental VHL disease". It is unclear whether these patients will develop VHL-related tumors during their lifetime, however given the historical penetrance and associated morbidity and mortality of VHL lesions, we opted to apply the standard VHL patient surveillance protocol.

Currently, the expanding practice of germline testing via multigene panels that include hereditary cancer risk genes across multiple cancer types provides insights into the genomes of completely asymptomatic patients. The result is the identification of germline variants in unexpected genes, linked to unsuspected hereditary risks for cancer. This is not a VHL-specific phenomenon and encompasses many cancer-predisposing genes. Penetrance, namely the percentage of individuals harboring the pathogenic variant who express any phenotype of the disease, may be influenced by many factors, including gender, age, genetic (specific germline variant, genetic background inherited from the parents), and environmental variables. These "incidental" findings in patients without disease-specific lesions are likely to challenge our established view of the penetrance and expressivity of inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. Moreover, established guidelines on how to clinically follow these patients are lacking. We recommend referral to specialized high-risk cancer clinics for surveillance recommendations.

### Mechanisms of disease: genetic mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^0997e728]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it increases in prevalence with advancing age to about 6% in people older than 65 years. The chance of developing atrial fibrillation at age 40 years or older is about 25% in men and women. This arrhythmia accounts for about one-third of all strokes, and 30% of all patients with atrial fibrillation have a family history of the disease. In 1997, Brugada et al. identified the first locus for familial atrial fibrillation on chromosome 10q22-24 in three different Spanish families. Since that time, seven further loci have been mapped and four relevant genes identified. All these genes encode potassium-channel subunits. The mechanism of action by which all four genes induce atrial fibrillation is via shortening of the action potential duration and atrial effective refractory period. The consistency of the mechanism of action beckons the development of therapy specifically targeted to prevent these molecular events. In addition to monogenic diseases, patients with structural heart disease are predisposed to atrial fibrillation by inherited DNA polymorphisms. The development of chips with hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to perform genome-wide scans will elucidate over the next few years the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that predispose to atrial fibrillation. Within the next decade, most of the genes responsible for atrial fibrillation and the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that confer predisposition will probably be identified, and therapies will be developed on the basis of individuals' genomic profiles. In this review I provide an overview of the understanding of the relevant genetic mutations that have been identified so far, and briefly discuss what implications this information might have for practice.

### Association of familial history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, or myocardial infarction with risk of Kawasaki disease [^db01bafd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile disease that causes systemic inflammation of all medium arteries and multiple organs and tissues. This disease is the most common cause of childhood‐acquired heart disease in most industrialized countries. The incidence rate of KD is increasing, but despite 40 years of investigation, the cause of KD remains unknown. Environmental toxin exposure, autoimmune causes, and infectious diseases are the most widely proposed theories. Epidemiological clustering (such as seasonal variation) suggests that infection may be the main trigger factor of KD, although unique specific microorganisms have not yet been identified.

Recently, host genetic factors may be involved in the pathophysiology of KD, which results in activation of the innate immune system. The high prevalence of KD in Asian populations, especially Korean and Japanese children, strongly supports the genetic predisposition for the onset of KD. For decades, KD researchers have attempted to identify candidate genes that induce susceptibility to the disease, particularly human leukocyte antigens. However, those approaches could not model the possible causations at the current state of research. Definitive research results are still lacking. Some studies have shown an increase in the incidence of KD history among parents of patients with KD and siblings and extended family members in index cases. One study reported that genetic predisposition and family pattern may be related to its occurrence.

Family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is important and is considered a risk factor for a patient developing KD. Nevertheless, there are few studies on the association of KD and a family's CVD history. Some study results revealed higher incidence of ischemic heart disease in fathers of the subjects with severe KD. In this study we identify the risk factors for KD in children with a family history of CVD from a propensity‐score matched analysis in a national cohort.

### Physician-directed genetic screening to evaluate personal risk for medically actionable disorders: a large multi-center cohort study [^e7d48d2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Another potential benefit of genetic screening is the ability to find individuals with undiagnosed Mendelian disease presenting in primary care practices. This has been demonstrated by the application of a phenotype risk score (developed by mapping clinical features of Mendelian diseases into phenotypes derived from electronic health records) in which phenotype-genotype associations were used to identify patients with five Mendelian disorders that had previously been undiagnosed or diagnosed incorrectly in a primary care setting. One may conclude that many individuals with significant risk for, or already manifesting, actionable hereditary disorders are likely escaping diagnosis. In fact, the genes responsible for three of the five disorders that went undiagnosed but were flagged by the phenotype risk score (i.e. Marfan syndrome, hereditary hemochromatosis, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome) were part of the proactive screening panel. Proactive genetic screening could identify more at-risk individuals, especially as technologies make it easier to screen more broadly and variant interpretation capabilities continue to improve.

Complex and interrelated challenges will impact the use and utility of genetic screening for assessing personal risk for actionable disorders. First, inadequate understanding of the penetrance associated with these disorders, differences in risk based on ethnicity or lifestyle, and the spectra of variants in diverse populations may limit the current ability of proactive genetic screening to precisely determine risks. As a result of differences in penetrance, the probability that a clinically significant finding will accurately predict whether someone eventually develops that condition may vary between symptomatic individuals and healthy individuals without a personal or family history. Although disease risk may be lower in the latter group, it is still expected to be higher than in the general population. This was the premise behind the ACMG secondary findings guidelines and the NAM recommendations. In fact, we have seen in this clinical cohort and other studies that a small number of individuals who are considered healthy and undergo recommended clinical follow-up due to a genetic variant identified through proactive genetic screening are found to be affected with a subclinical or atypical Mendelian phenotype. It is therefore important that positive reports clearly encourage further clinical evaluation, including increased surveillance and ongoing monitoring, but that they not be used in isolation to justify irreversible clinical actions. As longitudinal studies worldwide provide better estimates of penetrance for many disorders, the precision of the predictive value of population-level screening will increase. These issues as well as additional challenges associated with implementing DNA-based population screening programs will require further consideration and are beginning to be discussed broadly.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### Estimating disease prevalence in large datasets using genetic risk scores [^61ccd54e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The development and refinement of polygenic analysis techniques is greatly increasing our understanding of many diseases. Using polygenic risk has allowed insights into disease etiology and through Mendelian randomization evaluation of causality. Clinically, capturing polygenic susceptibility through genetic risk scores (GRS) can be used to determine individuals at the highest risk of a disease –. This paper concentrates on an innovative use of polygenic risk to genetically estimate disease prevalence (proportion of individuals with and without a disease) within a cohort. Currently estimating disease prevalence is difficult as it requires robust clinical classification. Disease-specific investigations are rarely available in population-level data and inaccuracies associated with self-reported diagnosis are well recognized. Given the increasing availability of population-level genetic data, novel polygenic estimates of disease prevalence are an extremely attractive alternative.

The basis of genetically determining disease prevalence is fundamentally that the distribution of a specific disease GRS within a cohort will reflect the mixture of GRS of those with the disease (cases) and those without (non-cases). This mixture GRS distribution will lie between reference groups of cases and non-cases and will reflect the relative proportion of cases to non-cases (Fig. 1a). The location of the mixture cohort's GRS distribution in comparison to the GRS distribution of known cases and non-cases allows the respective proportion of each group to be determined which provides a genetic-based estimate of disease prevalence. Furthermore, using the genetically calculated proportion of a disease within a cohort allows the additional benefit of associated clinical features of the genetically defined disease cohort to be determined. It is worth emphasising that in almost all polygenic risk situations, even those at the highest genetic risk are unlikely to develop the relevant disease and therefore this concept does not remain valid at an individual level. Nonetheless, at a group level the average GRS will be higher in a cohort with disease versus those without.

Familial (genetic) atrial fibrillation — familial AF, defined as lone AF running in a family, is more common than previously recognized and should be distinguished from AF secondary to other genetic diseases; the likelihood of developing AF is increased among those whose parents had AF, suggesting a familial susceptibility, although the molecular defects responsible are largely unknown; specific chromosomal loci have been linked to AF in some families and two mutations associated with gain of function leading to short atrial refractoriness have been discovered in several Chinese families.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^645f5f33]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional model of clinical practice incorporates diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Diagnosis classifies the sick patient as having or not having a particular disease. Historically, diagnosis was regarded as the primary guide to treatment and prognosis ("what is likely to happen in the future"), and is still considered the core component of clinical practice.

This traditional model now has to meet the demand for health care to deliver demonstrable quality. Changes in clinical practice must be justified by better outcomes, as valued by patients, or more efficient and safer delivery of health care. The usefulness of diagnostic and treatment decisions, and the value of new tests and interventions, are judged by whether patients classified with diagnosed disease do better and those classified without disease come to no harm.

This requires information about patient prognosis – the likelihood of future outcomes in patients with a given disease or health condition. Prognosis research aims to understand the likelihood of different outcomes, which factors predict these likelihoods, how best to estimate an individual's likelihood of different outcomes, and how this information can be used to target interventions and improve outcomes.

### Family history of cancer and the risk of childhood solid tumours: a Norwegian nationwide register-based cohort study [^ed4977c1]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The risk for childhood melanoma was elevated in our study and was still significantly elevated after excluding cases of probable hereditary syndromes. Epidemiological studies suggest that interactions between solar exposure, fair skin, immunosuppression and family history of melanoma are the main determinants of childhood melanoma. Familial cases account for ∼10% of malignant melanomas. The incidence of the disease rises steeply with age. These results may indicate that not only family history may play a role in the development of this disease, but also environmental factors.

The diagnosis of a cancer in a child should induce the clinician to investigate the causes of the cancer. In some cases, hereditary syndromes can be detected. It can be a heterogeneous condition and patients can have a wide variety of abnormalities. Furthermore, early diagnosis is crucial to provide appropriate medical management. However, genetic predisposition for childhood cancer is underdiagnosed. This study adds to the body of evidence that inherited genetic susceptibility may be a factor in the development of childhood solid tumours. Identifying children with increased hereditary risk of developing cancer is of high importance, as it may inform a potential cancer therapy protocol. In some predisposition syndromes, a modification in therapy for the cancer is needed, for example, when radiotherapy is contraindicated or when an adjustment of chemotherapy dose is advised. Furthermore, for several predisposition syndromes, a surveillance program is indicated for the early identification of other malignancies.

Family members of patients with an identified cancer predisposition syndrome may have excesses of some cancers and this may be partly attributable to greater cancer awareness. Establishing the diagnosis of a hereditary syndrome, and beginning surveillance when appropriate can make patients and their families feel more secure. It might also influence family planning and reproductive choices.

Secondary findings penetrance versus intervention risk — "Generally, a higher penetrance threshold would be required" to add a gene-disease pair when identifying an SF is likely to lead to a "highly burdensome or risky intervention in asymptomatic individuals"; the goal of SF is "to intervene early to mitigate adverse health effects", sometimes via "noninvasive diagnostics" or other "low-risk activities", but in other cases prevention "can only be achieved through surgery or another high-risk intervention", where acting on low-penetrance findings may be "unlikely to generate significant medical harm" yet could create "a net harm" in individuals who would not have developed symptoms.

### The illusion of polygenic disease risk prediction [^07f78545]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A problem at the interface of genomic medicine and medical screening is that genetic associations of etiological significance are often interpreted as having predictive significance. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many thousands of associations between common DNA variants and hundreds of diseases and benign traits. This knowledge has generated many publications with the understandable expectation that it can be used to derive polygenic risk scores for predicting disease to identify those at sufficiently high risk to benefit from preventive intervention. However, the expectation rests on the incorrect assumption that odds ratios derived from polygenic risk scores that are important etiologically are also directly useful in risk prediction and population screening.

### The history of genetics in inflammatory bowel disease [^c0da86f5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Genetic epidemiology

Ethnic differences

IBD has been associated with considerable geographic and ethnic differences in incidence and prevalence. Generally, the incidence of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) has gradually increased since the Second World War, especially in northern Europe and North America, where the highest incidence rates have been reported. In several areas with traditionally low occurrence of IBD, such as Asia and Africa, increasing figures have been reported in more recent years. Although historical differences could be influenced by a number of factors, including different types of biases, these shifts in the risk of developing IBD within limited period of times can barely be explained by changes in the genome, but rather provide evidence for the importance of exposure to environmental factors in the disease pathogenesis. On the other hand, the higher risk of CD in Jews, and especially in Ashkenazi Jews, seem to persist irrespective of geographic location or time period, suggesting that there actually might be ethnic differences in the genetic predisposition to IBD.

Family studies

The familial nature of IBD was first recognized in 1909. Since then, aggregation of cases of IBD in families has been widely confirmed, with 5–23% of patients with IBD having an affected first-degree relative (Table 1).

Table 1
Studies of first-degree relatives in a proband with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Families with multiply affected individuals, so-called multiplex families, are most often concordant for disease type, i.e. either CD or UC, although mixed families are reported in approximately one-fourth of the families. This was an early argument for a model in which some genetic variants are disease specific and some variants are common to both UC and CD, whereby environmental factors might influence disease phenotype. In recent years, molecular genetics has confirmed that certain genetic variants are shared by CD and UC and other variants are disease-specific. The recent reported associations between methylation of specific regions of the genome and CD may indicate that environmental factors could influence disease phenotype in IBD by epigenetic modifications of the genome.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^4bdaf436]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful.

Discussion

Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome.

Summary

Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.

### Clinical trio genome sequencing facilitates the interpretation of variants in cancer predisposition genes in paediatric tumour patients [^6db07477]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

TGS is a broad sequencing approach that allows the identification of secondary findings outside of CPS genes in both children and their parents. In our cohort, a secondary finding was reported in 2.3% of cases. The variants were reported to the families whenever it was of direct relevance to the carrier in accordance with the ACMG guidelines and appropriate clinical management was recommended. The detection rate of secondary findings was slightly increased compared to previous studies that reported such findings in 1–2% of cases. This difference can most likely be attributed to the smaller sample size of this study and differences in the published gene sets.

Conventional genetic counselling and testing strategies are based on family history, tumour entity, and age at onset. Family history alone does not seem to be a sufficient marker to identify carriers of P/LP variants in CPS genes, as only 40% of cases with a P/LP variant in a CPS gene were found have a family history indicative for CPS. Therefore, extended clinical criteria catalogues were developed that include additional parameters such as, the occurrence of second malignancies, specific malignancies with a high rate of underlying genetic cancer disposition, excessive toxicity, syndromic characteristics, and paediatric patients with rare or adult-type tumours. Based on the Jongmans criteria, genetic evaluation would have been recommended to 30 patients. All patients with a P/LP variant in a gene likely to be causative for their disease would have been identified by this questionnaire. This is in line with two previous studies reporting the identification of 100% (modified Jongmans criteria) and 80.9% (classic Jongmans criteria) of patients with P/LP variants in CPS genes. The study design does not allow to evaluate if all the patients would have been offered a genetic test based on the recommendation of genetic counselling, but this study confirms the high sensitivity of current clinical criteria to identify at risk patients. An unselected approach, as used here, still might prove beneficial as it is independent of a manifest disease in the parents and accounts for incomplete penetrance, gender-specific cancer risks and environmental exposure, which can reduce the informative value of family history. In addition, the concern of a relevant number of parents regarding a predisposition to tumour diseases in their family supports the general offer of genetic testing.

### MSH6 germline mutations in early-onset colorectal cancer patients without family history of the disease [^a031e34c]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Molecular characterisation of early-onset CRC is important to clarify whether this clinical feature is caused by dominant germline mutations with variable penetrance or arising de novo, by recessive inheritance, or are merely sporadic events. Two groups have previously described one MSH6 germline mutation each in two young CRC patients without family history of the disease. We describe six previously unreported MSH6 genetic alterations in 38 early-onset CRC patients with negative family history of HNPCC-related cancer. Three of these six alterations are novel MSH6 germline mutations (three out of 38 mutations; 7.9%), namely, a deletion and two missense mutations, one of the latter occurring contiguously to a silent mutation (Figure 1).

The MSH6 mutation p.G1186fsX1190 is in all likelihood disease causing, as it leads to a premature stop codon at position 1190 and the predicted truncated protein looses one of the two MSH2- and the Mg 2+ -binding domains. In addition, the patient's tumour presented MSI-H phenotype only in mononucleotide markers, a feature reported to occur preferentially in tumours associated with MSH6 germline mutations, and screening for MLH1 and MSH2 mutations was negative. On the other hand, neither the 54-year-old father (Figure 2) nor the 47-year-old healthy blood donor carrying this mutation presented clinical symptoms of CRC (they had never performed colonoscopy screening), suggesting variable penetrance of this mutation. The modifier factors originating early-onset CRC in this 27-year-old patient remain unknown, but some data suggest that multiple mutations in different genes may influence the penetrance of the disease. For instance, reported an 18-year-old CRC patient with three mutations (one missense APC mutation and a nonsense and a missense MSH6 mutation), whereas none of the family members presenting only one or two of the three mutations presented colorectal neoplasms. Other authors have suggested that genetic and environmental factors may modify the risk conferred by mutations in cancer predisposition genes, as considerable inter-individual variation in age at cancer diagnosis has been observed in kindreds sharing the same genetic predisposition mutation. Further studies are warranted to identify factors modulating the age of onset, penetrance, or tumour location in individuals with inherited MMR deficiency, as this knowledge may improve risk estimates and help identify individuals who are genetically susceptible to develop CRC at an early age.

The cost of genomic information has fallen steeply, but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context.

Methods

We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks.

Findings

Analysis of 2.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported.

Interpretation

Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.

### Risk estimates for complex disorders: comparing personal genome testing and family history [^c4d24a65]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Personal genome testing allows the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with an increased risk for common complex disorders. An area of concern in the use of personal genome testing is how risk estimates generated differ from traditional measures of risk (e.g., family history analysis). We sought to analyze the concordance of risk estimates generated by family history analysis and by personal genome testing.

Methods

Risk categorizations for 20 complex conditions included in Navigenics personal genome testing were compared with risk categorization estimates derived from family history assessment using the kappa (κ) statistic.

Results

The only conditions showing slight agreement between risk assessment methods were Alzheimer disease (κ = 0.131), breast cancer (κ = 0.154), and deep vein thrombosis (κ = 0.201) in females, and colon cancer (κ = 0.124) in males. Eighty-six individuals (11.4%) were found to have additional genetic risks not assessed by personal genome testing after family and medical history assessment, including 38 individuals with family histories suggestive of hereditary cancer syndromes.

Conclusion

Discordance between personal genome testing and family history risk estimates suggests that these methods may provide independent information that could be used in a complementary manner. Results also support that eliciting family history adds value to overall risk assessment for individuals undergoing personal genome testing.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^0962b15c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening counseling and partner testing — if a woman is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, her reproductive partner should be offered screening to provide accurate genetic counseling for the couple with regard to the risk of having an affected child. Additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and options for prenatal testing, and if a carrier couple (ie, carriers for the same condition) is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options (eg, donor gametes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis) can be discussed. Individuals with a family history of a genetic disorder may benefit from the identification of the specific familial mutation or mutations rather than carrier screening, and knowledge of the specific familial mutation may allow for more specific and rapid prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening diminish the potential benefit of prenatal carrier screening, and screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^667db310]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG — Reanalysis and return of PRS results: Returning results at regular time intervals is not a precedent in genomic medicine in which current practices around revisiting genetic risk information are prompted by either new results or new symptoms. In preventive practice, a setting in which PRSs are likely to be used, risk information is revisited regularly (typically at annual exams or other set time frames of screening).

### Association of family history with cardiovascular disease in hypertensive individuals in a multiethnic population [^66d6872e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is considered the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), with myocardial infarction and stroke accounting for most cases. 1 Because of its high prevalence, hypertension is responsible for the majority of the cases of CVD. 2 However, data from longitudinal cohort studies are subject to confounding and cannot clearly show to what extent high blood pressure itself accounts for the observed risk and to what extent it is merely a marker that identifies high‐risk patients. Data from randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive treatment are less subject to confounding, and therefore more reliable than those from longitudinal studies for estimation of the individual risk for CVD originating from hypertension alone. A Cochrane meta‐analysis of 18 placebo‐controlled trials for primary prevention showed that, in patients with untreated hypertension, the yearly incidence of either myocardial infarction or stroke is < 1%. 3 This translates into a lifetime risk of either myocardial infarction or stroke of < 20%, assuming risk increases linearly over the residual lifespan of subjects of similar age and country of origin as those in the trials. 4 In other words, over 80% of all untreated hypertensive individuals will experience no event in their lifetime. These data suggest that hypertension does not seem to be a strong risk factor for all individuals but it probably is for certain subpopulations. If we could identify the specific subpopulations in which hypertension itself results in an increased risk, we would be able to better target screening and adapt treatment decisions to the risk level.

Family history of CVD could be used as a tool to identify which hypertensive individuals are at particularly high risk. A positive family history of CVD is an independent predictor of both myocardial infarction 5, 6 and stroke. 7, 8, 9 Prognostic models for stroke that include both hypertension and family history have predictive value greater than models that include hypertension or family history alone. 8 Among individuals with hypertension, family history of CVD has been shown to be independently associated with mortality by ischemic heart disease 10 and family history of CVD mortality with incidence of overall CVD. 11 Therefore, a positive family history of CVD could reflect an underlying genetic predisposition related to CVD. 12

In the current study, we investigated this possible role of family history in hypertensive individuals in a multiethnic population of relatively young age, since the incidence of hypertension‐related CVD differs across ethnic groups 13, 14 even among persons with hypertension 15, 16 and since young individuals may be erroneously assigned a low risk of CVD. Therefore, better risk estimation in this specific group could lead to better identification of hypertensive individuals at high risk for CVD, especially in multiethnic populations.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^845e6ced]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades and certainty — definitions and practice suggestions: Grade A states, "The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade B states, "The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade C states, "The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances". Grade D states, "The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits", with the suggestion, "Discourage the use of this service". An I statement says, "The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined", and advises, "Read the Clinical Considerations section of the USPSTF Recommendation Statement. If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms". Levels of certainty regarding net benefit are described as High — "The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate — "The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low — "The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of the limited number or size of studies; important flaws in study design or methods; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice; lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes". The USPSTF defines certainty as the "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct", and net benefit as "benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population".

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^b32dfb79]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Genetic testing in chronic pancreatitis — indications, aims, and downstream actions are that if the etiology is unclear, if the patient has a family history of pancreatic diseases, if the disease persists after therapeutic intervention, or if the patient is young (e.g., less than 35 years of age), then genetic testing is indicated; the past 2 decades have identified several genes associated with the diagnosis of CP, but there are no RCTs, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses specifically evaluating whether patients with idiopathic CP should be offered genetic testing; the primary goal of genetic testing is to identify underlying pancreatitis-related disorders that are contributing to the pathogenesis process, to assist in decision making, and to help prevent the development of irreversible CP; examples include CFTR variants with a CFTR-related disorder or cystic fibrosis, which can present as RAP or CP; genetic testing results provide important early information about the etiology of pancreatitis-related disorders, drive confirmatory testing and stratify patients by disease prevalence affecting biomarker predictive values; determination of the genetic etiology also informs decisions about more radical therapy for persistent or severe disease, such as total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation.

### The role of genetic testing in pulmonary fibrosis: a perspective from the pulmonary fibrosis foundation genetic testing work group [^75b338ee]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for genetic testing in FPF — genetic testing is considered for patients with FPF when results would influence patient-specific disease management, inform individual risk stratification, provide context for extrapulmonary disease manifestations, or provide relevant information for the patient or their relatives. Panel-based gene sequencing should be considered for all patients with a diagnosis of and with a family history of pulmonary fibrosis, and pathogenic variants in TERT, TERC, PARN, and RTEL1 convey high risk for rapid progression and poor survival; in such cases, clinicians may consider deferring invasive surgical lung biopsy. Patients who harbor rare pathogenic variants may be at risk for nonpulmonary fibrosis manifestations that warrant surveillance, including lung cancer in those with SFTPA1/2 variants and liver disease and bone marrow dysfunction in those with telomere-related variants. For patients with FPF, telomere length (TL) testing alone is an imprecise screening tool for a telomere-related gene variant, but broadly speaking age-adjusted TL of more than the 50th percentile is less likely to coexist with a pathogenic telomere gene variant, whereas TL of less than the first percentile increases the likelihood; isolated TL testing can aid evaluation of patients with a personal or family history of multisystem manifestations suggestive of a short telomere syndrome. In this scenario, a short telomere syndrome is considered unlikely when age-adjusted TL is more than the 50th percentile, but is more likely when TL is less than the first percentile even when no mutation is identified.

### Genetic risk prediction in complex disease [^b11b6e7a]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

ROC statistics are not without their disadvantages, however. They are not dependent on the prevalence of the disease, with the result that even a high AUC predictor of a very rare disease is often of little practical use. For instance, consider a predictor of a disease with a prevalence of 1%: even with specificity and sensitivity of 0.93 (typical of a test with an AUC of around 0.98) only 12% of the individuals who test positive will go on to develop the disease. Alternate statistics such as the positive and negative predictive values account for prevalence. The positive predictive value (PPV) is the proportion of people who test positive for the disease who go on to develop it, and the negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of people who test negative who remain healthy. Note that, like sensitivity and specificity, the positive and negative predictive values are dependent on the risk score threshold T. These statistics can be used to tune the parameter T: for instance, while in the example above a test of a 1% disease with an AUC of 0.98 had a PPV of 12% and a sensitivity of 93%, by raising the threshold we could also produce a test with a sensitivity of only 40%, but a PPV of 75%. This test would miss a larger proportion of people with the disease, but would have much higher confidence that those it caught will go on to show symptoms.

### Common genetic variants modify disease risk and clinical presentation in monogenic diabetes [^4121485c]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Our findings support the hypothesis that monogenic disorders exist on a continuum, where both pathogenic mutations and polygenic background shape disease manifestation. Age-dependent conditions, such as MODY, are likely to have a larger polygenic contribution compared with neonatal-onset disorders. As evidence accumulates, this observation may extend to the majority of monogenic disorders, albeit to varying degrees. However, each condition will require individual evaluation to quantify the relative contributions. With the declining cost of genetic testing and the increasing identification of presymptomatic carriers through incidental findingsand newborn screening programmes, there is a growing need to refine disease risk prediction. Currently, risk assessment relies solely on the presence of pathogenic mutations. To provide more precise risk stratification, it may be necessary to incorporate non-mutation factors, such as polygenic risk scores or family history, as is already done in conditions such as breast cancer. As whole-genome sequencing moves toward becoming a first-line test, a single assessment could offer comprehensive genetic information, incorporating both monogenic and polygenic risk. However, clinical implementation will require large-scale, multi-ancestry MODY datasets and collaboration across dedicated cohorts to enable robust model development, validation and equitable application. Further research is needed to evaluate the added clinical value of this approach in improving diagnosis and risk prediction.

### Familial implications of autoimmune disease: recurrence risks of alopecia areata and associated conditions in first-degree relatives [^d09e300c]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA), a complex autoimmune hair loss condition, affects approximately 2.1% of the population. Individuals with AA have increased susceptibility to diseases such as atopy and autoimmune disorders, but little is known about first-degree relatives' risk to develop AA and associated conditions. Genetic counseling for multifactorial conditions, including autoimmune disease is complex, but potentially valuable. Anecdotally we know patients with AA ask medical providers about recurrence risk for family members as well as question whether they and their relatives are at risk for other conditions. Data on AA recurrence risks and comorbid conditions among relatives of affected individuals comprise valuable information that may guide clinical management by genetic counselors. This study investigated the recurrence risk of AA and compared the prevalence of associated conditions among first-degree relatives to the general population. The study also assessed the validity of self-reported conditions for a subset of participants. Relatives of individuals with AA (N = 155), recruited from the National Alopecia Areata Foundation Registry, completed telephone surveys about their personal medical history for 70 medical conditions associated with AA. Medical records for 60 participants were compared to self-reported responses. One-sided proportional tests, in which it is assumed the disease prevalence in first-degree relatives is higher than for those in the general population, yielded a 7.8% estimated risk of AA versus the general population prevalence of 2.1%. Furthermore, there are increased risks of 33 associated conditions, including atopy and other autoimmune conditions. Comparison of medical reports to self-reported conditions indicated only 12% was incongruent. The findings may help genetic counselors better serve patients and their families by informing them of lifetime risk estimates of developing AA and comorbid conditions, resulting in early diagnosis of autoimmune diseases in AA families. Findings also provide evidence supporting the validity of self-report data in AA families.

### Clinical utility of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^fd0691c8]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

PGT-P uncertainty and study needs — risk communication and further trials are emphasized. Even with additional studies, it is unlikely that such effects could be ruled out completely, and individuals undergoing PGT-P would need to accept some amount of unknowable risk, which should be communicated to them; more work is needed to clarify outcomes that matter to prospective parents versus reduced lifetime incidence used in preliminary simulations; although long-term clinical trials exploring the clinical validity of PGT-P for many late onset disorders may be impractical, many aspects can be evaluated in prospective clinical trials, and further outcome measures are needed before PGT-P is implemented and widely available for clinical use.

### Diagnostic interpretation of genetic studies in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases: a working group report of the primary immunodeficiency diseases committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^2eeeffb0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Other evidence for pathogenicity assessment in PIDDs includes explicit guidance: Summary statement 13: Although the presence of a probable genetic explanation might reduce the likelihood that other genetic changes are pathogenic, the presence of a dual molecular diagnosis must not be excluded. Additionally, Summary statement 14: A variant in a gene strongly associated with the immunodeficient phenotype in the patient should be viewed with increased suspicion for pathogenicity. Supporting context notes that the presence of an alternate explanation for the immunologic phenotype or disease is considered supporting evidence that the variant might be benign, but caution is advised because more than 5% of patients with PIDDs have been observed to carry dual molecular diagnoses that produce a blended phenotype. Moreover, the presence of a phenotype or family history highly specific for the gene affected by the variant is normally considered supporting evidence for pathogenicity, and in PIDDs this might increase this evidence from supporting to moderate; for example, a novel variant in CYBB in a male patient with absent neutrophil respiratory burst and history of recurrent staphylococcal abscesses should be judged with increased suspicion for pathogenicity.

### Comparison of pheochromocytoma-specific morbidity and mortality among adults with bilateral pheochromocytomas undergoing total adrenalectomy vs cortical-sparing adrenalectomy [^15993d67]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

It is important to note that the patients undergoing cortical-sparing adrenalectomy had slightly smaller pheochromocytomas in our study. Indeed, total adrenalectomy has been suggested for large pheochromocytomas.

As expected, most patients with bilateral pheochromocytoma had a predisposing genetic mutation, as demonstrated in 96% of patients in our cohort with available testing. Molecular genetics can dramatically improve preoperative characterization of patients as having heritable vs sporadic pheochromocytoma. The most frequent mutations in our cohort involve RET leading to MEN 2 and VHL leading to VHL disease. Although personal and family histories are important in diagnosing heritable pheochromocytoma, patients with an underlying germline mutation often present without hallmark clinical features suggestive of a particular hereditary syndrome. Availability of DNA sequencing provides a powerful diagnostic tool to identify such mutations in patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. This is poignantly illustrated by the fact that 36% of our cohort initially presenting with unilateral pheochromocytoma subsequently developed contralateral disease. In these patients, molecular genetic results could have changed initial management, leading to the decision to proceed with a cortical-sparing surgery in patients at high likelihood of future contralateral disease. Moreover, an individualized monitoring approach to include workup for nonpheochromocytoma manifestations of a specific syndrome could have been instituted at an earlier time.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e7f24845]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### Principles of screening [^cba7419b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially-oriented procedures for progressively analyzing risk.

Diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively answer the question of whether or not a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) are necessary for proper utilization of screening tests.

### The mathematical limits of genetic prediction for complex chronic disease [^b76b6cba]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attempts at predicting individual risk of disease based on common germline genetic variation have largely been disappointing. The present paper formalises why genetic prediction at the individual level is and will continue to have limited utility given the aetiological architecture of most common complex diseases.

Methods

Data were simulated on one million populations with 10000 individuals in each populations with varying prevalences of a genetic risk factor, an interacting environmental factor and the background rate of disease. The determinant risk ratio and risk difference magnitude for the association between a gene variant and disease is a function of the prevalence of the interacting factors that activate the gene, and the background rate of disease.

Results

The risk ratio and total excess cases due to the genetic factor increase as the prevalence of interacting factors increase, and decrease as the background rate of disease increases. Germline genetic variations have high predictive capacity for individual disease only under conditions of high heritability of particular genetic sequences, plausible only under rare variant hypotheses.

Conclusions

Under a model of common germline genetic variants that interact with other genes and/or environmental factors in order to cause disease, the predictive capacity of common genetic variants is determined by the prevalence of the factors that interact with the variant and the background rate. A focus on estimating genetic associations for the purpose of prediction without explicitly grounding such work in an understanding of modifiable (including environmentally influenced) factors will be limited in its ability to yield important insights about the risk of disease.

### How to inform at-risk relatives? Attitudes of 1379 Dutch patients, relatives, and members of the general population [^8bba599a]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the present study, we have assessed the preferences of Dutch probands and relatives, and members of the general population on how to inform at‐risk relatives of autosomal dominant diseases. Our findings show that many participants preferred that the proband informs at‐risk relatives. However, a majority believed HCPs should also be involved in this information process. There was an agreement between the patient and population sample on this matter. Previous research also indicated that patients and relatives often prefer the proband to inform relatives, because this seems the most logical approach (Forrest et al. 2003; Keenan et al. 2005; Leenen et al. 2016; Pentz et al. 2005).

Active involvement of HCPs was, however, desired by both our patient and population sample. Our findings indicate that HCPs should primarily engage in a supportive role, supporting probands in informing at‐risk relatives by providing information and providing help if probands are unable or unwilling to inform relatives. Some participants were in favor of direct contact by HCPs in all cases. Interestingly, a majority of participants from the general population preferred relatives to be informed personally, in case of both a family‐mediated and a direct contact approach. This suggests that personal contact between relatives and HCPs might be considered beneficial, including when using a direct contact approach.

Most participants preferred the principles of a cascade screening approach. This is also the most logical approach from a healthcare perspective, since relatives with the highest risk are approached at first (Miller et al. 2013). In addition, psychological harm for second‐degree relatives with a connecting first‐degree relative who does not have the genetic predisposition can be prevented (Miller et al. 2013; Van Langen, Hofman, Tan, & Wilde, 2004). However, previous studies suggest that the process of cascade screening often breaks down and further‐degree relatives are not reached (Burns et al. 2016; Shah et al. 2018). Interestingly, a majority of participants in our study believed that in case a relative decides to not get tested, connecting second‐degree relatives should be informed.

### Predictive accuracy of combined genetic and environmental risk scores [^25080b72]. Genetic Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Predicting the individual risk of disease is one of the major goals of epidemiology and, because most common diseases have a heritable component, there has long been interest in using genotype data to inform prediction of disease onset, prognosis, or treatment response. Indeed for Mendelian disorders genetic prediction has established clinical applications in counselling, prophylactic intervention, and embryonic screening. For the common, complex disorders however, progress has to date been slow (Abraham & Inouye, 2015; Chatterjee, Shi, & Garcia‐Closas, 2016; Jostins & Barrett, 2011). Despite the success of genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying numerous risk variants for many disorders, these variants typically explain a small proportion of the variation in risk; a number of studies have examined the predictive accuracy of GWAS "hits" and generally found limited utility for risk prediction (Eriksson et al. 2015; Talmud et al. 2015; Weissfeld et al. 2015), although there have been some successes (Maas et al. 2016; Patel et al. 2016). The reasons are that the associated markers individually have small effects on risk, and the markers discovered to date are a small fraction of the total complement of risk variants. The realization that most, perhaps all, complex traits are polygenic, that is, determined by thousands of genetic variants with small effects, has motivated a shift toward thinking about the genetic basis of disease as a single entity (Dudbridge, 2016). Under this paradigm, the whole genome should be regarded as a risk predictor, but attempts in this direction have so far also yielded modest results (Evans, Visscher, & Wray, 2009; Locke et al. 2015; Maier et al. 2015).
