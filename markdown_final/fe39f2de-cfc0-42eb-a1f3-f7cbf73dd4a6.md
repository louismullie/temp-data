## Question

Pediatric asthma management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric asthma management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing asthma from mimics. Then, I should assess current control and future risk using validated tools. Next, I will select initial controller therapy based on age and severity using a stepwise approach, including SMART/MART where appropriate. After that, I need to ensure inhaler technique, adherence, and trigger mitigation are addressed. I will then plan monitoring and step-up/step-down rules, manage exacerbations with structured follow-up, and finally consider severe/difficult-to-treat asthma pathways including biologics and phenotype-directed care, all while integrating education and shared decision-making at every step.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis carefully, because over- and underdiagnosis are common in children and the diagnosis should be revisited over time as new information emerges. In children 5 years and younger, I should use a probability-based approach based on symptom pattern, frequency, and severity rather than rigid wheeze phenotypes, and I must avoid diagnosing asthma solely on symptom improvement after a trial of preventer medication, especially in school-aged children, to prevent misclassification and overtreatment [^112Npigm] [^115MUAss] [^114PfQ9H].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and objective testing strategy by age. In children 6 years and older, spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility is appropriate, whereas in younger children routine lung function is not feasible, so I should rely on clinical patterns and, when available, consider FeNO as an adjunct in children 4 years and older to support Type 2 inflammation and guide therapy, while remembering that FeNO is not diagnostic by itself and must be interpreted in context [^117Aq171] [^112w4CDg] [^113HSkDw].

> I need to ensure I assess both current symptom control and future risk domains at baseline. Current control includes daytime/nighttime symptoms, activity limitation, and reliever use, and future risk includes exacerbations, lung growth/decline, and medication side effects, using validated tools like ACT or ACQ where age-appropriate and documenting lung function when feasible, because good symptom control does not eliminate exacerbation risk and both domains should drive treatment decisions [^114GWX52] [^113dhhAz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I match the step to age and severity. For children 6–11 years, GINA recommends a stepwise approach with preferred options including low-dose ICS whenever SABA is used in Step 1, low-dose ICS-LABA or ICS-formoterol MART in Steps 3–4, and specialist referral for Step 5, while for children 5 years and younger, low-dose ICS is the cornerstone controller and SABA-only treatment should be avoided outside of specific contexts, with device choice tailored to age and technique [^111DJ5mc] [^113pQ9XK] [^114sHVA1].

> Let me consider reliever strategy carefully. SABA monotherapy is no longer recommended for children older than 5 years due to increased mortality risk, and as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by at least 60% compared with SABA alone in mild asthma, so I should prefer ICS-formoterol as reliever when available, reserving SABA-only for children 5 years and younger in whom ICS-formoterol is not approved, and I should double-check local labeling because some recommendations may be off-label in certain regions [^111uCzH1] [^1118YidJ] [^111chcsG].

> I should confirm device selection and technique because effectiveness depends on delivery. For children under 3 years, pMDI with spacer and face mask is preferred, transitioning to mouthpiece as soon as feasible, and for school-aged children, pMDI with spacer or DPI where appropriate can be used, but I must train and reassess technique at every visit since poor technique is a major cause of apparent nonresponse [^114sHVA1] [^115AemWM].

> Next, I should review adherence and modifiable risk factors because these often explain poor control more than pharmacologic failure. I need to check for tobacco smoke exposure, obesity, allergen sensitization with relevant exposures, and psychosocial barriers, and I should tailor environmental control strategies to identified triggers, as individualized indoor allergen mitigation can reduce symptoms and exacerbations with efficacy comparable to some controller medications [^116LsTVQ] [^112Lxuh9].

> I will now examine the monitoring cadence and step rules. After initiating or changing controller therapy, I should review response in 2–3 months, step up if uncontrolled after verifying technique and adherence, and step down after 3 months of good control, with routine follow-up every 3–12 months and a visit within 1 week after any exacerbation, using standardized control tools and extending visit time for severe disease or complex cases [^111TrNgo] [^115AemWM] [^116DfbqW].

> But wait, what if control remains suboptimal despite appropriate therapy? I should double-check for alternative diagnoses, comorbid rhinitis/sinus disease, dysfunctional breathing, and adherence issues, and only then escalate to higher-dose ICS-LABA, add LTRA or tiotropium in Steps 3–4, and consider MART if not already used, recognizing that many children labeled "severe" have difficult-to-treat rather than truly treatment-resistant disease [^111NvTmz] [^111DJ5mc] [^112qZZSr].

> For severe or Step 5 asthma, I need to ensure referral for expert assessment, phenotyping, and consideration of biologics. Type 2-high phenotypes may respond to anti-IgE, anti–IL-4/13, or anti–IL-5/5R agents, but I should confirm high-dose ICS use, optimize technique and adherence, and document exacerbation burden before initiating these therapies, and I must remember that many real-world severe pediatric patients would have been excluded from pivotal trials, so careful selection and follow-up are essential [^113gNw6d] [^111NvTmz] [^114WpoGE].

> Let me think about exacerbation management and follow-up. For moderate-to-severe attacks, I should give SABA plus ipratropium, administer systemic corticosteroids in acute care for children 6–11 years unless the attack is very mild, and arrange follow-up within 1–2 days and again at 1–2 months to optimize maintenance therapy and address modifiable risks, using standardized pathways in critical asthma when available [^117YNbRp] [^1117x8e1] [^114xp38L].

> I should confirm that every child has a personalized asthma action plan and that education is repeated at each visit. Written action plans improve outcomes, and education should include inhaler technique, trigger avoidance, adherence strategies, and recognition of worsening symptoms, with content adapted for developmental stage and family literacy, and I should verify that schools have access to quick-relief medication and action plans to reduce delays in care [^114nxmNt] [^112aHh7j] [^111h7LRR].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am aligning with evolving evidence. GINA's emphasis on minimizing SABA-only therapy, the role of as-needed ICS-formoterol, and the Assess–Adjust–Review cycle are key shifts, and I should remain alert to new pediatric data and regulatory updates that may refine recommendations, especially for younger age groups where evidence remains more limited [^1118YidJ] [^113CD9Bg] [^111chcsG].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure no gaps: confirm diagnosis with age-appropriate methods, assess control and risk, select stepwise therapy with ICS as the foundation and ICS-formoterol preferred for reliever when indicated, optimize technique and adherence, mitigate triggers, monitor systematically with step-up/step-down rules, manage exacerbations with structured follow-up, and escalate to specialist care and biologics for severe disease, embedding education and shared decision-making throughout [^113CD9Bg] [^114PfQ9H].

---

Pediatric asthma management centers on **stepwise pharmacotherapy** aligned with symptom control and exacerbation risk, with **ICS as first-line** therapy and regular reassessment to step up or down therapy [^111DJ5mc] [^113CD9Bg]. Key elements include **ICS-formoterol as preferred reliever** in children ≥ 6 years, SMART/MART for moderate-to-severe disease, and avoidance of SABA-only regimens due to increased risk [^111DJ5mc] [^111uCzH1]. Education, inhaler technique, adherence, and trigger avoidance are essential; individualized written asthma action plans and structured follow-up improve outcomes [^114nxmNt] [^115AemWM]. Severe asthma warrants specialist referral for phenotyping and consideration of biologics; systemic corticosteroids are reserved for acute exacerbations, and growth monitoring is recommended with long-term ICS use [^113gNw6d] [^1117x8e1].

---

## Diagnosis and assessment

- **Clinical features**: Recurrent wheeze, cough, dyspnea, and chest tightness, often triggered by allergens, infections, exercise, or cold air [^114PfQ9H].

- **Diagnostic challenges**: Over- and underdiagnosis are common; diagnosis should be reviewed regularly and confirmed with objective tests when possible (spirometry, FeNO) [^114PfQ9H] [^112w4CDg].

- **Assessment of control**: Use standardized tools (e.g. Asthma Control Test, Childhood Asthma Control Test) to evaluate symptom control and exacerbation risk [^113dhhAz].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Stepwise approach

GINA and NAEPP recommend a **stepwise approach**, adjusting therapy based on control and exacerbation risk [^111DJ5mc] [^111m6LH4].

| **Step** | **Age group** | **Preferred controller therapy** | **Reliever therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | ≥ 6 years | Low-dose ICS whenever SABA is used | SABA or ICS-formoterol |
| 2 | ≥ 6 years | Daily low-dose ICS | SABA or ICS-formoterol |
| 3 | ≥ 6 years | Low-dose ICS-LABA or medium-dose ICS | SABA or ICS-formoterol |
| 4 | ≥ 6 years | Medium-dose ICS-LABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol MART | SABA or ICS-formoterol |
| 5 | ≥ 6 years | Refer for specialist assessment, biologics, or add-on therapies | SABA or ICS-formoterol |

---

For children ≤ 5 years, **low-dose ICS is first-line**, with leukotriene receptor antagonists as alternatives; SMART/MART is not recommended due to limited evidence [^113pQ9XK].

---

### Controller medications

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: First-line therapy for persistent asthma; reduce symptoms, exacerbations, and improve lung function [^111DJ5mc].

- **Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)**: Add-on therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma; never use without ICS [^111DJ5mc].

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)**: Alternative or add-on therapy, particularly in young children or those with allergic rhinitis [^111DJ5mc].

- **Biologics**: Omalizumab, mepolizumab, and others for severe, uncontrolled asthma with specific phenotypes [^113gNw6d].

---

### Reliever medications

Short-acting beta-agonists (**SABA**) have traditionally been used for quick relief but are now discouraged as sole therapy due to increased risk of exacerbations and mortality [^1118YidJ]. For children ≥ 6 years, **ICS-formoterol** is preferred as reliever therapy, particularly in SMART/MART regimens, because it reduces severe exacerbations and improves control [^111DJ5mc].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Education**: Essential for improving adherence, inhaler technique, and self-management skills [^114nxmNt].

- **Written asthma action plans**: Individualized plans improve adherence and reduce exacerbations [^notfound].

- **Environmental control**: Identify and reduce exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g. tobacco smoke, dust mites, pets) [^116LsTVQ].

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor control, adjust therapy, and address modifiable risk factors [^115AemWM].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up every **3–6 months** is recommended to assess control, adherence, and inhaler technique, with more frequent visits after exacerbations or therapy changes [^116DfbqW]. Growth should be monitored in children on long-term ICS, and therapy adjusted if growth suppression is observed [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Severe asthma

Severe asthma is defined as uncontrolled symptoms or persistent exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA; it requires specialist referral, phenotyping, and consideration of biologics [^113gNw6d]. Difficult-to-treat asthma reflects poor control due to **modifiable factors** (adherence, inhaler technique, comorbidities) and should be addressed before escalating therapy [^116BJZAL].

---

### Acute exacerbations

Acute exacerbations are managed with **SABA, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids**; severe cases may require oxygen, magnesium sulfate, or intravenous bronchodilators [^1117x8e1]. Follow-up within 1–2 weeks after exacerbations is essential to optimize therapy and prevent recurrence [^115AemWM].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Digital health tools, including eHealth monitoring and telemedicine, are being explored to improve adherence and control [^115aFHzD]. Personalized medicine aims to tailor therapy to **asthma phenotypes and biomarkers**, including the use of biologics [^116mZk5s].

---

Pediatric asthma management requires a **comprehensive, stepwise approach** that integrates pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, regular monitoring, and individualized care. ICS remain the cornerstone of therapy, with ICS-formoterol preferred as reliever in children ≥ 6 years. Education, adherence, and environmental control are critical to achieving optimal outcomes, and severe asthma necessitates specialist referral and advanced therapies.

Objective

Despite the availability of effective treatments, asthma control in children and adolescents remains inadequate and rates of health care use are high. This follow-up to a recent review (O'Byrne et al, Eur Respir J. 2017;50[3]) examines a number of challenges in current pediatric asthma management compared with that of an adult perspective and discusses possible alternative strategies that might improve pediatric asthma management and control.

Data Sources

The evidence base for this review is limited because, historically, much of the research has been performed in adults.

Study Selections

Not applicable.

Results

Pediatric asthma management is complicated by variability in asthma severity and control and difficulty in measuring pulmonary function and airway inflammation. Current challenges in pediatric asthma management include the recommended initial therapy treating only the symptoms rather than the underlying inflammation and switching to controller therapy only when asthma subsequently worsens.

Conclusion

Alternative strategies that might improve pediatric asthma management and control include replacement of short-acting β 2 -agonist relievers by an inhaled corticosteroid plus a fast-acting β 2 -agonist (short-acting β 2 -agonist or fast- and long-acting β 2 -agonist) combination at Global Initiative for Asthma step 1 or 2 to ensure that patients receive an inhaled corticosteroid whenever they feel the need for symptomatic relief. Such an approach could eliminate the problem of learned overuse or over-reliance on short-acting β 2 -agonist reliever medication and address the other challenges in current pediatric asthma management. Clinical studies in pediatric patients or large studies involving a proportion of pediatric patients are required to provide the supporting evidence needed to help advance such new approaches and improve asthma control from a pediatric perspective.

Conclusions

Paediatric asthma outcomes are currently poor and many deaths are preventable. The aim should be to avoid asthma attacks occurring with appropriate maintenance therapy, and they should be viewed as never events. In order to improve outcomes, accurate diagnosis and management are essential. Good asthma care extends beyond providing medication and should include education, as well as supported self-management advice. The use of PAAPs remains limited and a significant number of young people with asthma do not have one. Postattack asthma reviews are a key opportunity to review maintenance medication and current symptom control.

Goal of asthma management in young children — aims and care cycle are specified: as with other age groups, the goal is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the child, including to achieve and maintain good long-term control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels, and to minimize future risk; that is to reduce the risk of flare-ups, maintain lung function and lung development as close to normal as possible, and minimize medication side-effects. The long-term goals are achieved through a partnership between the parent/caregiver and the health professional team, with a cycle of Assess (diagnosis, symptom control, risk factors, inhaler technique, adherence, parent preference), Adjust treatment (medications, non-pharmacological strategies, and treatment of modifiable risk factors), and Review response including medication effectiveness and side-effects.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

The AAP identifies the key components of effective school-based asthma management and provides practical tips and resources to help schools and primary care providers improve care for students with asthma.
- The high prevalence of asthma and its impact on school attendance make effective asthma management a priority for schools. Asthma is a leading cause of school absence, leading to nearly 14 million missed school days per year.
- Research indicates that many students lack an asthma action plan and, particularly in low-income areas, do not have a quick-relief inhaler at school. This leads to delayed care and unnecessary 911 calls.
- Surveys indicate that school nurses are confident in managing asthma emergencies but are interested in additional training and support.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1168dN8q]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. Its prevalence has increased in many countries, especially among children. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) aims to improve the diagnosis, management, and prevention of asthma by providing an up-to-date evidence-based strategy and tools and practical resources for clinicians worldwide.

GINA was established through a 1993 collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. NHLBI to develop a strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA strategy report) has been updated annually since 2002 to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations as new evidence emerges and new therapies are approved. The GINA strategy report is under continual review by the Science Committee. GINA methodology involves evaluation of new evidence identified from a twice-yearly rolling review of original research and systematic reviews (not limited to specific population/intervention/comparison/outcomes questions), assessment of its impact on existing or new recommendations, and consideration of whether and how it should be integrated into the overall asthma management strategy. GINA is independent of industry.

This article summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 GINA strategy report, published in April 2021, and briefly summarizes the evidence and rationale for recent important changes.

### A worldwide charter for all children with asthma [^112iCn1U]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

5.8 Research priorities

Research is needed to persuade governments that there are better ways to diagnose and manage asthma in children. We need targeted research into better diagnosis, particularly in younger children, with a review of new and existing biomarkers to identify different endotypes. Exacerbation risk research is needed with the recognition that factors driving it will be different between and within high‐income countries and LMICs. We should start by a meeting of policymakers to determine data requirements that are needed to facilitate policy changes which improve important outcomes.

How do we move from a global philosophy where management of acute attacks is the priority to one where longitudinal care or preferably prevention of symptom development is the rule? We now have measures of asthma burden such as the Composite Asthma Severity Index and Asthma Severity Scoring System 104, 105, 106 and tools to predict who is at risk for seasonal exacerbations. 36, 37 These tools need studying and probably modifying in LMICs. Ultimately, we need to progress toward a primary prevention strategy for childhood asthma, which should be part of the research plan.

Asthma data are inadequately collected at a national level with no global international vision. In contrast, the success of the cystic fibrosis registries and their quality improvement programs is enviable. 107, 108 Setting up local, national, and global severe children's asthma registries will help, progressing then to other asthma categories. These registries should contain longitudinal information on lung trajectories, the frequency of asthma attacks, medication adherence patterns, patient behaviors, and environmental details.

Further research into the feasibility of an international standard for asthma care is needed with transparent benchmarks for diagnosis, management outcomes and medications prescribed, organized and funded at a national level and data shared with international registries, similar to that developed for adults with severe asthma. 109 It will improve asthma care 11 and inform policymakers. Financial support is required for the implementation of minimal standards together with real world‐research into its outcomes.

Technology advances will enable electronic medication monitoring, as well as the organization of medical records to identify those children with frequent hospital admissions. Such technology could be used to identify children receiving suboptimal care. While these potential advances may not be available in LMICs, they are feasible in high‐income countries containing deprived communities. The asthma community needs to encourage research into these techniques. If benefits are shown, such advances will enter into asthma guidelines with subsequent adaptation in both high income and LMICs. Table 4 summarises the key elements of research policy and public expectation needed to really make a difference.

Follow-up

Children who have experienced an asthma exacerbation are at risk of further exacerbations. Arrange follow-up within 1–2 days of an exacerbation and again 1–2 months later to identify modifiable risk factors and exacerbation triggers, optimize ongoing asthma management, and check inhaler technique and adherence.

Future research opportunities — The Expert Panel identified topics that would benefit from additional research. Priorities include differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations and the cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations. Additional comparative work includes daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma and additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm whether daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma. Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control are also identified.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114sHVA1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger — key points include that wheezing episodes in young children should be treated initially with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA), regardless of whether the diagnosis of asthma has been made, but for initial episodes of wheeze in children < 1 year in the setting of infectious bronchiolitis, SABAs are generally ineffective. A trial of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma, alternative diagnoses have been excluded and respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or wheezing episodes are frequent or severe. Response to treatment should be reviewed before deciding whether to continue it, and if the response is absent or incomplete, reconsider alternative diagnoses. The choice of inhaler device should be based on the child's age and capability; the preferred device is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer, with face mask for < 3 years and mouthpiece for most children aged 3–5 years, and children should be switched from a face mask to mouthpiece as soon as they are able to demonstrate good technique. Review the need for asthma treatment frequently, as asthma-like symptoms remit in many young children, and advise parents/caregivers that asthma symptoms will often return later in life.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112X1FMk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g. medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes.

GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS–formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ⩾60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA.

Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS–formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS–formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS–long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4.

Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111chcsG]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

New therapies and indications — GINA frames recommendations within a global regulatory context, noting that some recommendations may be off-label in some countries and that this is a particular issue for pediatrics, including for preschool children and for children aged 6–11 years. For new therapies, GINA's aim is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance about new therapies and their positioning in the overall asthma treatment strategy as soon as possible; however, for therapies with sufficient good-quality evidence in relevant asthma populations, recommendations may be held until after approval for asthma by at least one major regulatory agency (e.g. European Medicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration).

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in preschool and school-age children: focus on the 2007 NAEPP guidelines [^116KChY5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the changes in the revised National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma pertaining to children and highlights areas that may benefit from further study.

Recent Findings

The most recent NAEPP Guidelines contain several pediatric-specific features, including subdividing classification and treatment recommendations, into three age categories (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and ≥ 12 years). The introduction of the concept of two domains within asthma severity and control, namely impairment and risk, allows classification of patients who are either treatment-naive (asthma severity) or who are receiving controller therapy (asthma control). Suggestions for criteria for initiating daily controller therapy in preschool children with exacerbations or risk factors for asthma symptom persistence, including the asthma predictive index, are discussed. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are provided for the three age groups.

Summary

The recent NAEPP Asthma Guidelines improve on many areas of the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children and lead to the identification of areas that would benefit from further research.

9. A continuum of care for worsening asthma, from early self-management, through to primary-care and acute-care management

The GINA report now includes several new tools: an evidence table summarising pharmacological options for written asthma action plans, flow charts for assessment and management of exacerbations in primary care and acute care, and a summary of key issues to be addressed during re-assessment and ongoing management after any exacerbation. Every patient should have an individualised written asthma action plan. The report provides the rationale for key new recommendations including an early increase in inhaled corticosteroid dose in written asthma action plans (unlike previous guidelines that have recommended only bronchodilator treatment and oral corticosteroids); initiation of regular inhaled corticosteroid-based treatment after any exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids, or its resumption if the patient was previously non-adherent, and, for severe exacerbations, use of controlled-flow oxygen with a target saturation for adults of 93–95%, rather than high-flow oxygen. GINA now recommends the term 'flare-up' for communication with patients, as it is simpler and less ambiguous than 'exacerbation' or 'attack', and it reinforces the crucial message that asthma is associated with inflammation and is present even when symptoms are absent.

10. A new approach to diagnosing asthma in children 5 years and younger

Previous classifications of wheezing phenotypes (episodic wheeze/multiple-trigger wheeze; or transient wheeze/persistent wheeze/late-onset wheeze) have not been found to be stable, and are no longer recommended. Instead, GINA recommends that a probability-based approach should be taken to the diagnosis of asthma in preschool children, taking into account the pattern, frequency and severity of symptoms; the diagnosis should be reviewed as the child grows older. Assessment of asthma control in this age group, as in adults, should include both current symptom control and assessment of risk factors for future adverse outcomes such as exacerbations; a trial of controller therapy should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma, if respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or if wheezing episodes are frequent or severe. The aim is to reduce the risk of future severe exacerbations, even if symptoms are currently well controlled, and to minimise the impact of uncontrolled asthma on schooling and physical and social development.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^114PfQ9H]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Asthma is the the most common chronic respiratory condition of childhood worldwide, with around 14% of children and young people affected. Despite the high prevalence, paediatric asthma outcomes are inadequate, and there are several avoidable deaths each year. Characteristic asthma features include wheeze, shortness of breath and cough, which are typically triggered by a number of possible stimuli. There are several diagnostic challenges, and as a result, both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of paediatric asthma remain problematic. Effective asthma management involves a holistic approach addressing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, as well as education and self-management aspects. Working in partnership with children and families is key in promoting good outcomes. Education on how to take treatment effectively, trigger avoidance, modifiable risk factors and actions to take during acute attacks via personalised asthma action plans is essential. This review aimed to provide an overview of good clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of paediatric asthma. We discuss the current diagnostic challenges and predictors of life-threatening attacks. Additionally, we outline the similarities and differences in global paediatric asthma guidelines and highlight potential future developments in care. It is hoped that this review will be useful for healthcare providers working in a range of child health settings.

Clinical questions about remission on treatment (e.g., in children with severe asthma treated with biologic therapy) include whether inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy can be down-titrated.

### Applying a biopsychosocial model to inner city asthma: recent approaches to address pediatric asthma health disparities [^112Lxuh9]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric asthma in inner cities is often severe and children living in these urban locations with socioeconomic disadvantage experience greater asthma morbidity. There are many interconnected risk factors that individually, and in combination, enhance asthma morbidity. These include biologic factors innate to the child, such as genetics and allergen susceptibility, as well as factors related to the family and neighborhood context. The biopsychosocial model can be used to frame these risk factors and develop interventions specific to the inner city. Successful inner city asthma interventions exist and key characteristics include multi-tiered components that operate within the community to coordinate disease management resources between patients, families and health care systems.

### Severe asthma in childhood: diagnostic and management challenges [^114WpoGE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Problematic severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. It is rare (< 5% of children with asthma), but accounts for 30–50% of all pediatric asthma healthcare costs. This review looks into the currently used management strategies and the innovative treatments, considering both conventional medications and innovative biological therapies for targeting airway inflammation.

Recent Findings

Patients with problematic severe asthma should be seen by pediatric asthma specialists using a stepwise approach. The first step is to exclude alternative diagnoses; the second is to consider and exclude comorbidities, and assess adherence to medication; the third step involves identifying the pattern of inflammation; and response to treatment in the fourth. Innovative biological therapies are emerging and healthcare professionals should know how to handle them. Patient phenotyping is the main step towards a targeted therapeutic strategy.

Summary

A careful management is important for children with severe asthma, who form a small but challenging group of patients. More research efforts are needed to enable a personalized medicine and a biomarker-driven approach.

Key messages

The quality of childhood asthma diagnostic guidelines is highly variable.
The evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations is generally of very poor quality.
There is discrepant advice on recommended diagnostic tests and thresholds across guidelines.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^116LsTVQ]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — indoor environmental control for pediatric asthma — states that indoor environmental exposures, particularly allergens and pollutants, are major contributors to asthma morbidity in children, and that environmental control practices aimed at reducing these exposures are an integral component of asthma management. It notes that some individually tailored environmental control practices have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations and are similar in efficacy and cost to controller medications. As part of tailored strategies, an environmental history can be obtained to evaluate key indoor exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens, with questions on pets or pests and whether community climatic characteristics favor dust mites, and with attention to sources of indoor air pollution such as the presence of smokers and the use of gas stoves and appliances. Diagnostic options include serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E antibody tests or referral for allergy skin testing to identify clinically relevant indoor allergens. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant exposure and are based on knowledge of its sources and characteristics, and include source removal, source control, and mitigation measures such as high-efficiency particulate air purifiers and allergen-proof mattress and pillow encasements, alongside education that can be delivered by primary care pediatricians, allergists, pediatric pulmonologists, other health care workers, or community health workers trained in asthma environmental control and asthma education. This clinical report was reaffirmed February 2024.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1118YidJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ⩾60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger [^113HSkDw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, emergency department visits, and hospitalisation. During the past two decades, many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively. However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-specific. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation, the main pathologic hallmarks of the condition, can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only descriptive approach that includes the definition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and public health officials to disseminate information about the care of patients with asthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scientific investigations into asthma care. Since then, GINA has developed and regularly revised a Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention. Publications based on the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention have been translated into many different languages to promote international collaboration and dissemination of information. In this report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life, including difficulties with diagnosis, the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies. Approaches to these issues will vary among populations in the world based on socioeconomic conditions, genetic diversity, cultural beliefs, and differences in healthcare access and delivery. Patients in this age group are often managed by pediatricians and general practitioners routinely faced with a wide variety of issues related to childhood diseases.

### Advances in pediatric asthma 2006 [^114xPQZb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Because the outcomes experienced in adult asthma often result from pathophysiology that begins in early childhood, this year's summary focuses on recent advances in pediatric asthma. This past year, we have learned that early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids in childhood asthma reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Theme issues over the last year focused attention on severe asthma and black box warnings. Both of these themes significantly affect the management of childhood asthma. Responsiveness to asthma treatment is heterogeneous even among patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing control and adjusting treatment accordingly. We are now moving toward an individualized approach to asthma therapy and searching for biomarkers and genetics as a resource to guide treatment. To improve asthma control, we must continue to obtain information on early asthma, severe asthma, asthma exacerbations, and methods to improve asthma control. Evaluation and management of severe asthma in children include verification of the diagnosis, assessment for coexisting illnesses, and identification of effective treatment strategies directed to adherence, medication delivery, and combination therapy. Application of biomarkers and genetics could be useful tools in individualizing our approach to the management of childhood asthma.

Figures 5 and 6 summarize the GINA options for initial asthma medications in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years newly diagnosed with asthma. Once treatment has been initiated, ongoing medication decisions are based on the same personalized cycle, in which treatment is stepped up and down according to the patient's needs within a track, using the same reliever. Treatment can also be switched between tracks according to patient needs and preferences. Before any step-up (Fig. 2), it is essential to check adherence to treatment, inhaled technique, relevant comorbidities and risk factors, and environmental factors affecting asthma (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by variable, reversible airway obstruction and hyper-responsive airways. There is a high economic burden due to a child having poorly controlled asthma with one or more asthma exacerbations resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization in a year. Publications on diagnosis, treatment, and management of pediatric asthma are ongoing with over 2,549 papers published from January-November 2022. The intent of this paper is to summarize 8 key topics that have prompted discussions with local, regional, and national asthma experts due to a shift in clinical practice or lessons learned from the recent pandemic that may have future application.

### Asthma across childhood: improving adherence to asthma management from early childhood to adolescence [^111h7LRR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects nearly 6 million US children. Throughout childhood, children undergo a series of biological, developmental, and psychosocial changes. Thus, factors influencing a child's asthma management differ across 3 essential stages-early childhood (0–5 years), school-aged years (5–12 years), and adolescence (12–18 years)-and require varied intervention by parents, school personnel, clinicians, and the children themselves. Because asthma care in children is characterized by fluctuations in severity and coordination among many stakeholders, optimal asthma control is difficult to achieve in this young population. Challenges in childhood asthma management are reflected in the low rates of children's adherence to medication regimes. Although pharmacological and biological factors addressing age in physicians' treatment choices are well outlined, age-specific approaches to patient-provider communication and asthma-related interventions are also important in improving quality of life for patients with pediatric asthma.

### Severe asthma guidelines in children and adolescents: a practical document for physicians [^116XRj3V]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common disease in childhood with a minority of affected children suffering from severe asthma. Patients with severe asthma require high dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroids to be well-controlled or remain uncontrolled despite such treatment. Although only a small subset of children and adolescents falls in this category, the management of affected patients represents a major concern for pediatricians. Guidelines and recommendations have been designed to guide the management of this group of patients. Though the terms "recommendations" and "guidelines" are often used interchangeably, it should be noted that the first one should be used more narrowly to identify specific actions and the second one to broadly refer to the umbrella under which multiple recommendations for a specific condition are provided. Moreover, the availability of several and sometimes-conflicting documents on severe asthma management both in adult and pediatric age could generate confusion among health care professionals. The manuscript analyses seven papers addressing severe asthma, comparing any key aspects and differences. Finally, we tried to create a more practical document for physicians to simplify the interpretation of the several available documents on severe asthma management focusing the pediatric age.

### Asthma management in children [^111AU5kR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, complex heterogeneous disease often beginning in early life and is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. The phenotypic differences that exist in children with asthma may impact underlying comorbid conditions and pharmacologic treatment choices. Prenatal factors for increased risk of asthma could include maternal diet and the maternal microbiome. Evidence also suggests that postnatal microbial exposures and colonization contribute to the risk of allergic diseases and asthma. After confirming the diagnosis, asthma management in children centers on 3 broad areas: pharmacologic treatment, treatment of underlying comorbidities, and education of the patient and caregivers on the importance of adherence and device technique. Moreover, social determinants of health significantly impact on symptom burden and treatment response.

### Managing problematic severe asthma: beyond the guidelines [^116syh8N]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

This review discusses issues related to managing problematic severe asthma in children and young people. A small minority of children have genuinely severe asthma symptoms which are difficult to control. Children with genuinely severe asthma need investigations and treatments beyond those described within conventional guidelines. However, the majority of children with poor symptom control despite high-intensity treatment achieve improvement in their asthma control once attention has been paid to the basics of asthma management. Basic asthma management requires optimisation of inhaler technique and treatment adherence, avoidance of environmental triggers and self-management education. It is also important that clinicians recognise risk factors that predispose patients to asthma exacerbations and potentially life-threatening attacks. These correctable issues need to be tackled in partnership with children and young people and their families. This requires a coordinated approach between professionals across healthcare settings. Establishing appropriate infrastructure for coordinated asthma care benefits not only those with problematic severe asthma, but also the wider asthma population as similar correctable issues exist for children with asthma of all severities. Investigation and management of genuine severe asthma requires specialist multidisciplinary expertise and a systematic approach to characterising patients' asthma phenotypes and delivering individualised care. While inhaled corticosteroids continue to play a leading role in asthma therapy, new treatments on the horizon might further support phenotype-specific therapy.

### Chinese guidelines for childhood asthma 2016: major updates, recommendations and key regional data [^112NzW25]. The Journal of Asthma (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

With increased industrialization and urbanization in China, pediatric asthma is becoming more prevalent. Despite a growing body of evidence, there remains a significant unmet need for adequate management of childhood asthma. The Subspecialty Group of Respiratory Diseases of the Society of Pediatrics, the Chinese Medical Association, and the editorial board of the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics have recently updated the "Guidelines for diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children", first published in 2008.

Methods

This article reviews the major updates to the guidelines and covers the main recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of pediatric asthma in China. Key regional data on epidemiology, clinical features, disease burden, knowledge among children and parents, and risk factors including pollution are provided to contextualize the recommendations.

Results

The major updates to the guidelines include: (1) A more practical definition of asthma; (2) assessment of asthma control that takes into account both current symptom control and future risk; (3) classification based on disease severity that corresponds with treatment step; (4) differentiation between difficult-to-treat and poorly controlled asthma; (5) an open-ended approach to pharmacological management; and (6) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in mild- to moderate-persistent asthma.

Conclusions

The updated "Guidelines for the diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children (2016)" combine the latest national and international clinical evidence and experience to provide practical and reliable recommendations to Chinese clinicians.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^111uCzH1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacological management

The pharmacological management of asthma involves two key components: maintenance and reliever therapies. Maintenance therapies are the mainstay of asthma management, and the treatment aim is that no reliever therapies are required. Use of reliever therapy suggests asthma control is poor.

An overview of maintenance and reliever therapies is outlined in tables 3 and 4, respectively. A stepwise approach to asthma management is encouraged, and pharmacological management varies on age, symptom control and the national guideline used. An overview of management approach in a number of national guidelines is summarised in table 5.

Table 3
Maintenance therapies

Table 4
Reliever therapies

Table 5
Summary of paediatric asthma national guidelines: focusing on management

Table 6
Biologic agents used in the management of asthma

GINA guidelines recommend dual ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy to children over the age of 5.SABA monotherapy was previously the main management starting point; however, compared with combined treatment, SABA monotherapy has been shown to be associated with asthma mortality.SABA monotherapy is now only recommended by GINA for use in children aged 5 or less. As seen in table 5, GINA recommends symptom-driven ICS use, compared with daily ICS use, as initial therapy in children over 6 years of age. In comparison to daily ICS use, symptom-driven use has demonstrated a similar exacerbation risk and reduces the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) inhalers are combined inhalers offering both maintenance and reliever therapy in those with asthma. These inhalers contain a number of maintenance and reliever therapies in different combinations. The use of these inhalers have been shown to reduce the risk of asthma attacks and emergency department (ED) admissions, improve lung function and decrease the need for reliever therapy. There is limited evidence in the effectiveness of SMART inhalers in children, but children over 12 years may be prescribed a SMART inhaler, which acts as both a maintenance and reliever therapy, if symptoms are not well controlled.

There are a number of biologic agents (table 6) that may be used in the management of paediatric asthma. These are endotype-specific, targeted therapies that should be used only under the supervision of specialists. Their availability and cost vary between countries and different healthcare systems. Detailed appraisal of the evidence base for their use is provided in the individual management guidelines and has been recently reviewed.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111a7wgi]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma–COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pQ9XK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma initiated a stepwise model based on an ongoing assessment of asthma severity and control. 9 An increasing step number corresponds to augmenting levels of intervention, and a decreasing step number corresponds to tapering down levels of intervention. Asthma severity refers to the intensity of the disease process, which is intrinsic to an individual's disease; severity is determined upon initiation of treatment. In contrast, asthma control is the degree to which symptoms impact a patient's life (eg, activity limitations); control must be continually assessed in order to adjust therapy accordingly. The NAEPP guidelines further focus on two domains of severity and control: impairment and risk. Impairment refers to the extent to which the frequency and intensity of asthma symptoms result in functional limitations for the patient, and risk refers to the likelihood of future asthma exacerbations, decline in lung function/lung growth, or adverse effects from medication. Severity also takes into account the amount of medication necessary to achieve control. Achieving and maintaining control is a major goal of asthma therapy; poorly controlled asthma is associated with increased risk of exacerbations. 10 Reducing impairment (eg, by preventing chronic symptoms) as well as minimizing future risk (eg, by preventing exacerbations) are therefore critical to the long‐term management of asthma. 9 The 2018 GINA report, which is updated and revised more frequently, also recommends a stepwise approach for asthma therapy. 2

Because asthma is heterogeneous in presentation and variable in course over time, its clinical consequences can be unpredictable if not assessed by objective determinants, such as lung function or airway hyperresponsiveness. Limiting the evaluation to the periodic use of subjective determinants of asthma, such as past interval history or asthma control scores, does not accurately reflect the natural history of an individual into adulthood. Persistent asthma refers to a continuation of symptoms, whereas asthma progression can be considered a worsening of asthma symptoms, potentially accompanied by a decline in lung function. 11 Although some children experience persistent or even progressive asthma as they enter adulthood, others experience a remission of symptoms as they age. 12, 13, 14

### Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide the treatment of asthma: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Aq171]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Target Audience

This practice guideline is designed to provide guidance to clinicians who manage adults and children 4 years of age and older with asthma, including adult and pediatric pulmonologists, adult and pediatric allergists, internists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, and other healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with asthma. The use of this guideline is not designed for the evaluation and management of acute asthma but rather is designed for treatment decisions in ambulatory settings for the ongoing management of this common disease.

### New and future strategies to improve asthma control in children [^1157nrHs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Symptomatic asthma in childhood has lifelong effects on lung function and disease severity, emphasizing the need for improved pediatric asthma control. Control of pediatric risk and impairment domains can be achieved through increased medication adherence or new therapeutic strategies. Developing electronic monitoring device technology with reminders might be a key noninvasive resource to address poor adherence in children and adolescents in a clinical setting. In patients who have persistently poor control despite optimal medication compliance, newly emerging pharmaceuticals, including inhaled therapies and biologics, might be key to their treatment. However, barriers exist to their development in the pediatric population, and insights must be drawn from adult studies, which has its own unique limitations. Biomarkers to direct the use of such potentially expensive therapies to those patients most likely to benefit are imperative. In this review the current literature regarding strategies to improve pediatric asthma control is addressed with the goal of exploring the potential and pitfalls of strategies that might be available in the near future.

Childhood asthma affects many children placing them at significant risk for health care utilization and school absences. Several new developments relevant to the field of pediatric asthma have occurred over the last 5 years; yet, there is much more to learn. It is poorly understood how to prevent the disease, optimally address environmental challenges, or effectively manage poor adherence. Moreover, it is not clear how to customize therapy by asthma phenotype, age group, high risk groups, or severity of disease. Highlights of advances in pediatric asthma are reviewed and multiple essential areas for further exploration and research are discussed.

Asthma is the leading chronic disease among children in most industrialized countries. However, the evidence base on specific aspects of pediatric asthma, including therapeutic strategies, is limited and no recent international guidelines have focused exclusively on pediatric asthma. As a result, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology nominated expert teams to find a consensus to serve as a guideline for clinical practice in Europe as well as in North America. This consensus report recommends strategies that include pharmacological treatment, allergen and trigger avoidance and asthma education. The report is part of the PRACTALL initiative, which is endorsed by both academies.

20 recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment starting with the most aggressive therapy necessary to achieve control, followed by a "step down" to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to minimize daytime and nocturnal symptoms, the number of asthma episodes and the use of short-acting beta agonists, to improve PEF to 80 percent or more of personal best and to allow the child to maintain normal activities without producing adverse medication side effects. acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICATIONS These drugs, including short-acting inhaled or oral beta 2 agonists, short-course oral corticosteroids or ipratropium, are taken as needed for immediate relief of acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Short-acting beta.

LONG-TERM CONTROL MEDICATIONS Medications for long-term control should be taken daily to maintain control of asthma and prevent exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most potent and effective long-term anti-inflammatory medications. They reduce inflammation in airways, improve pulmonary function to a greater degree than any other medication, reduce bronchial hyperre-sponsiveness and may reduce some aspects of airway remodeling, thus modifying disease progression. Some corticosteroids are effective in once- or twice-daily dosing regimens and may be used in all patient groups and for all levels of disease severity. 26 They are not a substitute for anti-inflammatory medications and should not be used to treat patients with acute symptoms or exacerbations. The FDA approved a long-acting beta 2 agonist, salmeterol, for treatment of asthma in children 12 years and older.

It may provide 24-hour bronchodilation with twice-daily dosing and may reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are first-line, daily anti-inflammatory inhaled agents that inhibit early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction, with virtually no serious side effects and no known drug interactions. 26 These medications are available in MDI and nebulizer formulations; however, frequent administration is required, which may discourage compliance. 24 Furthermore, these agents are less effective than corticosteroids in many patients. Nedocromil's bitter taste may discourage compliance in some children.

Last year's review on adult and pediatric asthma highlighted reports related to asthma genetics, the importance of upper airway management, the costs of asthma, and the importance of early recognition and intervention. This year we will organize our discussion to review recent reports related to the origins and persistence of asthma in both adults and children. We highlight Journal publications from 2004, along with recent key publications from other medical journals, to provide a perspective on the rapidly developing areas of genetics, including pharmacogenetics, respiratory infection, biomarker measurements, and asthma pharmacotherapy. This new understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma combined with clinical applications of genetics and biomarkers should lead to new management strategies. Asthma management is likely to change in the coming years from a strategy directed to the best outcome in groups of patients to an individualized approach to assessment and management.

View information about pediatric asthma symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options. Plus, AAP clinical recommendations, resources for managing pediatric asthma patients and helpful information to share with patients and families. Asthma Overview. Asthma is the most common chronic condition of the lungs with times of increased symptoms or flares. Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that is the key driver for causing symptoms including cough, wheezing, chest tightness/discomfort, shortness of breath that can strongly interfere with quality of life and daily function. Asthma is a chronic condition and requires frequent check-ins with the patient/child's primary care provider to determine how much their breathing is affecting their daily function, school attendance, exercise/activities and sleep. Providers should be equipped to use standardized questionnaires to understand the individual's perception of their breathing and adjust medications appropriately.

Asthma can have multiple triggers including illness or infections, environmental exposures such as tobacco exposure, air pollution, allergens or physical activity. It is important for providers and families to best identify these triggers to minimize the impact of asthma on the person's quality of life. An asthma specialist should be consulted if the diagnosis is in questions or child is not completely responding to medications, if they are having frequent exacerbations, difficulty determining their triggers or if they have additional conditions often seen in conjunction with asthma including nasal symptoms or allergic skin conditions. However, an asthma specialist does not replace the role of primary care providers in the long-term care of that child.

On this page, you can find many of the common triggers, treatment options and best practices to help minimize the impact of asthma on you, your patient's or your child's asthma, so they can live comfortably and not be limited.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^116BFv7o]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Seventeen topics were suggested initially for updating, and six topics were found to have sufficient new information to warrant an update. Key questions were drafted by the Advisory Council and used by AHRQ Evidence-Based Practice Centers (EPCs) to conduct systematic reviews that were published between October 2017 and March 2018. – The Expert Panel was then assembled in July 2018 and charged with using these systematic reviews to develop recommendations on these six previously chosen topics.

The Expert Panel updated the literature for the systematic reviews through October 2018 and then developed its recommendations. These recommendations differ from other guidelines in several important ways:
The key questions were developed a priori and not after a review of the current literature.
The Expert Panel was composed of diverse individuals not only from the asthma specialty community (adult and pediatric pulmonary and allergy specialists) but also from the general medical community (pediatric, internal medicine, family medicine, and emergency medicine providers). Expert Panel members also included health policy and dissemination and implementation experts, and the panel received input from patients and families.
The Expert Panel members abided by strict standards for conflicts of interest (COIs) developed by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)and in the spirit of the more recently released recommendations from the American College of Physicians (ACP). Individuals with any conflict of interest related to the updated topics recused themselves from discussions of those topics.
This was the first time that the NAEPP used the GRADE methodology (discussed later) to provide transparency in the decision-making process.
Lastly, but not insignificantly, the Expert Panel sought comments from external groups and individuals, including from the NAEPP Coordinating Committee (whose members represent a diverse group of stakeholders), the public, and federal agencies. Although the panel that developed the Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3) also sought external input, this approach has rarely been used by other asthma guideline committees. The Expert Panel considered this input when it developed the final recommendations and this document.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^111tqyP3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pediatric asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness. 1, 2 The 2018 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report defines two major long‐term goals of asthma management: (i) to maintain good control of symptoms with no restrictions on activity level and (ii) to limit future exacerbation risk, adverse effects, and fixed airflow limitation. 2 Additional goals of therapy include minimizing the necessity for short‐acting β 2 ‐agonist (SABA) use and preventing progressive loss of lung function. This concept of managing future risk is gaining momentum, yet only a small number of studies have investigated the long‐term effects of asthma treatment from childhood into adulthood. Furthermore, evidence‐based guidelines appear to have had little impact on improving outcomes, suggesting that a new approach is warranted. 3 The paradigm of childhood asthma management is shifting toward more personalized therapies and earlier intervention. 4, 5 In this narrative review, we discuss the current understanding of childhood asthma treatment, what is known about the long‐term effects of these treatments, and highlight open questions that remain.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

Last year's "Advances in pediatric asthma" concluded with the following statement: "Perhaps new directions in personalized medicine and improved health care access and communication will help maintain steady progress in alleviating the burden of this disease in children, especially young children". This year's summary will focus on recent advances in pediatric asthma that show significant accomplishments in reducing asthma morbidity and mortality over the last 10 years and discuss some pathways to further reduce asthma burden, as indicated in Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology publications in 2011. Some of the recent reports continue to shed light on methods to improve asthma management through steps to reduce asthma exacerbations, identify features of the disease in early childhood, alter asthma progression, intervene with nutrition, and more effectively implement the asthma guidelines. As new information evolves, it is also time to consider a revision of the asthma guidelines based on key studies that affect our management of the disease since the last revision in 2007. Now is also the time to use information recorded in electronic medical records to develop innovative disease management plans that will track asthma over time and enable timely decisions on interventions to maintain control that can lead to disease remission and prevention.

### How schools can help address social determinants of health in asthma management [^111WLLjN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Schools are in a unique position to address social determinants of health (SDOHs) in pediatric asthma management because of their potential to provide resources and facilitate collaboration with health care providers and services for children at risk within their community. SDOHs include economic factors, educational attainment and health literacy, neighborhood factors and the built environment, social and community aspects including discrimination and racism, and health care access and quality. These factors have a significant impact on asthma health in children, and certain populations such as minoritzed populations and those living in high-poverty environments have been shown to be at greater risk for adverse effects of SDOHs on asthma outcomes. School-based asthma programs address several SDOHs including health literacy, the built environment, and health care quality and access and have been shown to improve asthma outcomes. Key components include connection between the school and the health care team, self-management education, and directly observed therapy. School nurses play a key role in directing and managing effective programs because they can evaluate and support a student's health while considering the effect of SDOHs at interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy levels.

Journal theme issues in 2007 included the revised National Asthma Education and Prevention Program asthma guidelines, the accomplishments of the National Institutes of Health asthma networks, and focused discussions on environmental allergens, neutrophils, eosinophils, T cells, and epithelial cells, all of which affect pediatric asthma. The new asthma guidelines emphasize several key terms including severity, control, impairment, risk, and responsiveness that are relevant for advancing the care of children with asthma. This review highlights journal articles that relate to these guideline topics.

The treatment approaches to asthma vary in different childhood age groups: young children (age ≤ 5 years), school age (6–11 years), and adolescence (age 12–18 years), because what works for one age group might not be the best approach for another. Most school age children with asthma achieve good symptom control when treated with low to moderate dose ICS with or without a longacting β agonist, but a minority (3–5% of children with asthma)have severe disease and poor symptom control despite maximal treatment, and these children need further escalation in support and intervention. Not all these children with symptoms have severe, treatment resistant asthma, which is rare.

The World Health Organization categorised severe asthma into three groups: untreated severe asthma resulting from a failure of diagnosis or lack of availability of treatment (which is not confined to low and middle income countries); severe asthma that is difficult to treat, whereby social and environmental factors or comorbidities hinder the response to treatment; and severe, treatment resistant asthma that requires high level treatment with ICS and other controllers to achieve control or that remains uncontrolled despite high level treatment (figure 1).

A multidisciplinary approach is paramount in children with severe asthma. Severe asthma necessitates a broader approach that recognises extrapulmonary influences such as adherence, family values, comorbidities such as exposure to tobacco smoke, ongoing exposure to aeroallergens to which the child is sensitised, obesity, breathing pattern disorders, and poor symptom perception. Ancillary testing to exclude alternative diagnoses might be indicated. This team approach is essential to ensure that the right children are prescribed expensive and invasive biological medicines.

### International consensus on (ICON) pediatric asthma [^1122xBB9]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory disease in childhood throughout the world. Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. There is a trend toward considering phenotype-specific treatment choices; however, this goal has not yet been achieved.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^111yCWSZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines. This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development. The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

After starting initial controller treatment, review the child's response after 2–3 months or earlier depending on clinical urgency, consult Box 4–12 for recommendations for ongoing treatment and other key management issues, and step down treatment once good control has been maintained for 3 months.
