## Question

Low utic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about low uric acid (hypouricemia), including definitions, mechanisms, associated conditions, clinical implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define hypouricemia and what constitutes "low" by sex and context. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that lower uric acid. Next, I will examine disease associations and the strength of evidence, including any U-shaped mortality data. After that, I need to consider special populations and acute contexts like COVID-19. Finally, I will outline a practical clinical approach to evaluation and management, and I should double-check where guidelines are silent or conflicting before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a single cutoff. Hypouricemia is generally defined as serum uric acid less than about 2.5–3.0 mg/dL in women and less than about 3.5–4.0 mg/dL in men, though some epidemiologic studies operationalize "low" as < 3.5 mg/dL in men and < 2.5 mg/dL in women, and these thresholds are commonly used in mortality analyses and COVID-19 severity studies, which I should keep in mind as I interpret risk [^082035b1] [^c8fa6693].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanisms that plausibly lower uric acid. The two main buckets are decreased production and increased excretion. Decreased production can reflect xanthine oxidase inhibition (allopurinol, febuxostat), dietary purine restriction, or inborn errors like xanthinuria, whereas increased excretion can reflect uricosuric drugs, genetic variants in URAT1 that impair reabsorption, or tubular defects that increase fractional uric acid excretion; importantly, about 90% of filtered urate is normally reabsorbed, so even modest shifts in transporter function can meaningfully lower serum urate [^9940b7c1] [^76db9c44].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality in disease associations. I need to check the strength of evidence. Observational data link low uric acid to higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a U-shaped pattern, with increased risk at both low and high extremes; for example, in a large Korean cohort, men with SUA < 3.5 mg/dL had an adjusted all-cause mortality HR of 1.58 and women with SUA < 2.5 mg/dL had an HR of 1.80 compared with reference categories, suggesting a J-shaped or U-shaped relationship rather than a purely linear risk gradient [^082035b1]. But wait, what if confounding by malnutrition or illness explains this? Indeed, malnourishment modifies the association, with higher mortality at low SUA concentrated among malnourished individuals, which tempers causal inference and reminds me to consider nutritional status when interpreting low uric acid in older adults [^e3d22805].

> I will now examine neurodegenerative disease associations, since low uric acid has been repeatedly linked to Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Multiple studies show lower plasma uric acid in PD cohorts, and uric acid's antioxidant properties plausibly confer neuroprotection; however, most data are observational and heterogeneous, so I should be cautious about claiming causality or recommending urate-raising strategies outside trials [^26c5339d] [^9f78dbe3] [^e30403cf]. Let me reconsider whether any randomized data exist; I don't see definitive interventional trials establishing that raising urate slows PD progression, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^e30403cf].

> Next, I should review acute disease contexts where low uric acid has been repeatedly observed. In COVID-19, hypouricemia is common and correlates with severity; pooled cohorts show hypouricemia in about 20% of hospitalized patients and up to 77% of those requiring mechanical ventilation, and the association persists after adjustment, suggesting a marker of proximal tubular dysfunction and systemic severity rather than a direct causal toxin effect of low uric acid itself [^c8fa6693] [^6eddd7a1]. Mechanistically, low uric acid may reflect impaired tubular reabsorption and could coincide with reduced antioxidant capacity, but I need to ensure I don't over-interpret this as an indication to supplement uric acid therapeutically in COVID-19, which is not supported by current evidence [^7dc0fa4b].

> But wait, what if low uric acid is simply a proxy for over-treatment of hyperuricemia or gout? I should double-check the safety of very low urate targets. The ACR 2020 guideline supports treat-to-target urate lowering for gout but explicitly notes uncertainty about the safety of prolonged hypouricemia at serum urate ≤ 3 mg/dL, underscoring that we lack long-term safety data at very low urate levels and should individualize targets and monitor closely when pursuing aggressive urate lowering [^8af18ccb]. This means that while low uric acid is not inherently harmful, we should avoid pushing urate unnecessarily low without a compelling indication and surveillance plan [^8af18ccb].

> Let me think about special populations where low uric acid might be a clue to underlying disease. In severe eating disorders, particularly restrictive anorexia nervosa, uric acid is often low-normal or low at admission and rises with refeeding, likely reflecting low dietary purine intake and catabolic states; checking uric acid on admission can contextualize nutritional risk and recovery trajectories, though it is not a standalone diagnostic test [^11a44008]. In Wilson disease, low uric acid may accompany renal tubular dysfunction and can be a supportive biochemical clue, but I should confirm that its predictive value is limited and not use it as a screening tool in isolation [^f403e276].

> I should confirm the clinical approach when I encounter low uric acid. First, verify the laboratory result and repeat if unexpected, because assay error or preanalytical issues can misclassify urate. Then, review medications, diet, and fluid status; look for xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosurics, high-carbohydrate low-purine diets, or overhydration. Next, assess for acquired or genetic causes of uric acid wasting, including tubular disorders, and consider uric acid excretion fraction or 24-hour urate if the etiology remains unclear. Finally, interpret low uric acid in clinical context: in acute illness it may signal severity, in chronic disease it may reflect nutrition or renal handling, and in neurodegenerative phenotypes it may be a risk marker rather than a modifiable causal factor [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline recommends treating low uric acid itself. I need to check KDIGO and ACR documents. KDIGO 2024 addresses hyperuricemia in CKD and gout but does not recommend treating low uric acid, and ACR 2020 highlights uncertainty about prolonged hypouricemia without recommending interventions to raise uric acid; thus, there is no evidence-based indication to pharmacologically elevate uric acid solely for being "too low", and management should focus on correcting underlying causes and monitoring clinically relevant outcomes rather than the uric acid level per se [^38ac58f7] [^8af18ccb].

> In summary, I should emphasize that low uric acid is best viewed as a biomarker with context-dependent implications rather than a disease unto itself. It can reflect decreased production, increased excretion, nutritional compromise, or systemic illness severity, and while observational data show a U-shaped association with mortality and links to neurodegenerative diseases, causality remains unproven and there is no established indication to treat low uric acid pharmacologically; therefore, my clinical action is to investigate the cause, address modifiable contributors, and use the finding to inform risk stratification rather than to prescribe urate-raising therapy [^082035b1] [^e30403cf] [^8af18ccb].

Low uric acid (hypouricemia) is defined as **serum uric acid < 3.0 mg/dL** in adults and is less common than hyperuricemia, with a prevalence around 0.3–2.5% depending on the population and definition used [^6eddd7a1]. It is often due to **increased renal excretion** (e.g. uricosuric drugs, Fanconi syndrome, SIADH), **decreased production** (e.g. xanthine oxidase inhibitors, dietary deficiency), or genetic variants affecting urate transporters [^9940b7c1]. Low uric acid is associated with increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases (notably Parkinson's), cardiovascular events, and mortality, likely reflecting loss of uric acid's antioxidant and endothelial-protective effects [^2d717f56] [^082035b1]. Evaluation should include a focused history, medication review, urinalysis, and assessment of renal function; management targets the underlying cause, with no routine indication to raise uric acid unless there is a specific deficiency or severe neurodegenerative risk, in which case cautious dietary or pharmacologic strategies may be considered [^notfound].

---

## Definition and prevalence

Hypouricemia is typically defined as **serum uric acid < 3.0 mg/dL (178 µmol/L)** in adults, though some studies use sex-specific cutoffs (< 3.5 mg/dL in men, < 2.5 mg/dL in women) [^082035b1]. Prevalence varies by population and definition, ranging from 0.3% in ambulatory populations to 1.2–2.5% in hospitalized patients [^6eddd7a1].

## Physiological role of uric acid

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism and has **important antioxidant properties**, scavenging free radicals and contributing significantly to plasma antioxidant capacity [^ed7a2744]. It also modulates immune responses and may have neuroprotective effects, which helps explain some clinical associations with low levels [^2d717f56].

---

## Causes of low uric acid

Low uric acid results from **increased renal excretion**, **decreased production**, or **genetic factors**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Increased renal excretion | - Uricosuric drugs (probenecid, losartan, high-dose aspirin) <br/> - Fanconi syndrome <br/> - SIADH <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - High fluid intake |
| Decreased production | - Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat) <br/> - Severe dietary purine restriction <br/> - Liver disease |
| Genetic factors | - SLC22A12 (URAT1) mutations causing hereditary renal hypouricemia <br/> - PRPS1 mutations affecting purine synthesis |

---

## Clinical implications and health risks

Low uric acid is associated with several **clinical conditions**:

- **Neurodegenerative diseases**: Lower uric acid is linked to higher risks of Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and Alzheimer's disease, likely due to reduced antioxidant defense [^2d717f56] [^e30403cf].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Low uric acid correlates with higher risks of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular events, possibly reflecting impaired vascular protection [^7eb594d4] [^ac947d90].
- **Mortality**: Large cohort studies show a U-shaped relationship between uric acid and mortality, with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality at low levels [^082035b1] [^6a73db6b].
- **COVID-19 severity**: Hypouricemia is associated with severe COVID-19 and progression to respiratory failure, likely reflecting oxidative stress and endothelial injury [^c8fa6693] [^6eddd7a1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When low uric acid is detected, a **structured evaluation is recommended**:

- **Confirm result**: Repeat testing to exclude lab error.
- **History**: Assess diet, fluid intake, medications, and symptoms (neurologic, renal, endocrine).
- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and glucose.
- **Specialized tests**: Fractional excretion of uric acid, genetic testing if hereditary hypouricemia suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**. There is no routine indication to raise uric acid unless there is a specific deficiency or high neurodegenerative risk, in which case cautious dietary or pharmacologic strategies may be considered:

- **Dietary modifications**: Moderate purine intake, avoid excessive fructose, maintain adequate nutrition.
- **Medication review**: Adjust or discontinue uricosuric drugs if feasible.
- **Treat underlying conditions**: Manage renal tubular disorders, endocrine disturbances, or liver disease.
- **Experimental approaches**: In select neurodegenerative cases, inosine supplementation to raise uric acid is under study but not standard care [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause and reversibility**. Persistent hypouricemia from genetic or chronic renal causes may carry long-term risks of neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease, whereas reversible causes generally have a favorable outlook with appropriate management [^2d717f56] [^082035b1].

---

Low uric acid is uncommon and often reflects increased excretion, decreased production, or genetic variants. It is associated with higher risks of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease, likely due to loss of uric acid's antioxidant and endothelial-protective effects. Evaluation should be **targeted**, and management centers on correcting the cause; raising uric acid is not routinely indicated outside specific clinical contexts.

Conclusions

Several factors are associated as cause and consequences of high UA concentration. Higher waist circumference and BMI are associated with higher insulin resistance and leptin production, and both reduce renal uric acid excretion, thus increasing its concentration. HDL-c concentration is negatively associated to insulin resistance, what can influence its negative correlation to uric acid. Obese individuals usually have Metabolic Syndrome diagnostic, which can also increase uric acid serum concentrations due to synthesis increase (triglycerides - TG concentration) and lower excretion (arterial hypertension - AH) (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Determinants of hyperuricemia. UA = Uric Acid, BMI = Body Mass Index, TG = triglycerides.

Additionally, obesity and muscle mass (MM) reduction are associated with low-intensity chronic inflammation, and uric acid levels can increase in order to protect the organism against the moderate oxidative stress resulting from this situation. Low muscle mass (sarcopenia) is negatively associated with uric acid, However, it has not yet been clarified what the cause or effect is. Probably, oxidative stress produced by excessive uric acid can influence muscle mass reduction. The role played by diet on hyperuricemia has not yet been fully clarified, but high intake of fructose-rich industrialized food and high alcohol intake (particularly beer) seem to influence uricemia. The main mechanism of excretion of urate concentrations occurs by means of renal excretion; hence, glomerular function markers (urea and creatinine) are positively associated with uric acid (Figure 1).

Furthermore, there is still no consensus if UA is a protective or a risk factor, however, it seems that the quantity and the duration of the concentration of the uric acid in the blood is essential for this answer. Acute elevation seems to be a protective factor, whereas chronic elevation a risk factor.

Chemical characterization and biological importance

Uric acid (2,6,8 trioxypurine-C5H4N4O3) is an organic compound that is endogenously produced by animals as a purine metabolite. It is formed by the liver and mainly excreted by the kidneys (65–75%) and intestines (25–35%). UA is the end product of purine metabolism in humans due to the loss of uricase activity, which led to humans having higher UA levels than other mammals.

Due to its double bonds, uric acid has excellent antioxidant capacity, and it can be responsible for 2/3 of total plasma antioxidant capacity.

Because it is a weak acid that have a high dissociation constant, uric acid circulates in plasma (pH 7.4) predominantly (98%) in the form of a monovalent sodium salt (urate). It shows low solubility in water (as well as in plasma), and it would theoretically reach plasma saturation in the concentration of 6.4 mg/dL, which may not occur because solubility increase is provided by its binding to proteins, namely albumin, which is its main transporter. Protein-bound uric acid shows plasma solubility that is 70% higher than in its free state. Uric acid pathogenesis is usually associated with gouty arthritis or nephrolithiasis.

High uricemia pathogenicity is associated with its low solubility in the extracellular environment leading to crystal formation, low affinity (and deposition) to certain tissues and antigenicity (after crystal phagocytosis). This mixture of quantitative and qualitative etiological hyperuricemia factors is confounding because normouricemic individuals may show symptoms while others with hyperuricemia may not. In the clinical context, hyperuricemia is seen as a prognostic indicator of renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and inflammation, thus being a (modest) risk factor for mortality.

Uricemia homeostasis

Physiologically, uric acid plasma concentrations increases with age; they are smaller in women of childbearing age and, in post menopause women, it increase to similar values to those found in males.

The balance between uric acid production and excretion in males shows a turnover of 600–700 mg/day for a pool with a maximum of 1,000 mg, as shown by isotopic studies. Uric acid entry into the pool is controlled by hepatic production, which receives endogenous (nucleoproteins) and exogenous (dietary) precursor proteins. Uric acid exit from the pool in males is mainly controlled by the kidneys and by urine-forming factors, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration and tubular exchange.

### High plasma uric acid concentration: causes and consequences [^d0388a9c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

High plasma uric acid (UA) is a prerequisite for gout and is also associated with the Metabolic Syndrome and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Hyperuricemia increase in 16% all causes of mortality and 39% of total cardiovascular disease.

The hyperuricemia is defined as ≥ 7 mg/dL for men and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL for women, and is found mainly in postmenopausal women, African American, patients with renal disease and alcohol intake. Furthermore, many factors can influence the concentrations of UA, eg. diet, obesity, and Metabolic Syndrome. However, we still don't know if UA is a protective factor for the moderate oxidative stress in these situations or if it's a risk factor.

The aim of this review was to discuss the function of the UA in our organism and the main causes and consequences of the higher concentration of UA.

Production control

Purine bases and their nucleotides are rapidly captured by the liver and converted into xanthines, metabolized by uric acid or recycled by salvage pathways or de novo synthesis, and the latter requires a higher energetic cost (ATP consumption). Uric acid formation by xanthine occurs via hypoxanthine by the action of xanthine oxidase. In most mammals, uric acid is converted into allantoin by uricase and later into urea, which are excreted. For this reason, uricemia in these animals corresponds to 10% of human values.

Diseases accompanied by great cell depletion, such as leukemia, leukocytosis and dystrophies can increase the provision of nucleic acids to the liver and result in a larger production of uric acid. Hence, diseases resulting from innate purine metabolic errors may also result in hyperuricemia.

Uricemia as a protective factor

It is not known whether UA would be a causal factor or an antioxidant protective response against oxidative stress. While chronic high UA concentrations are associated to increased risk for CAD, acute elevations seem to provide antioxidant protection. UA contributes to > 50% of the antioxidant capacity of the blood. Furthermore, the UA has a protective action in vitamins C and E with the stabilizing activities in these vitamins and the presence of ascorbic acid in plasma is required for the antioxidant effect of UA. Also, it has a direct effect on the inhibition of free radicals such as peroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, protecting the cell membrane and DNA.

Most authors do not consider UA as a detrimental factor to the body health, because of its antioxidant function. The antioxidant activity of UA also occurs in the brain, being a protector for several disease such as multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative disease. Higher concentration of UA is associated with lower risk of development of Parksons disease and a favorable effect at the disease progression mainly.

### High plasma uric acid concentration: causes and consequences [^5cff30c4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

High plasma uric acid (UA) is a precipitating factor for gout and renal calculi as well as a strong risk factor for Metabolic Syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The main causes for higher plasma UA are either lower excretion, higher synthesis or both. Higher waist circumference and the BMI are associated with higher insulin resistance and leptin production, and both reduce uric acid excretion. The synthesis of fatty acids (tryglicerides) in the liver is associated with the de novo synthesis of purine, accelerating UA production. The role played by diet on hyperuricemia has not yet been fully clarified, but high intake of fructose-rich industrialized food and high alcohol intake (particularly beer) seem to influence uricemia. It is not known whether UA would be a causal factor or an antioxidant protective response. Most authors do not consider the UA as a risk factor, but presenting antioxidant function. UA contributes to > 50% of the antioxidant capacity of the blood. There is still no consensus if UA is a protective or a risk factor, however, it seems that acute elevation is a protective factor, whereas chronic elevation a risk for disease.

### Serum uric acid, disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 [^7dc0fa4b]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms linking hypouricemia and progression to severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 remains speculative and may be diverse. First, studies have shown uric acid to be an important antioxidant and poor outcomes in patients with hypouricemia might be related to reduced defense against oxidative stress. Second, uric acid was found to act as an endogenous modulator of innate immunity, and it is tempting to speculate that low levels of serum uric acid may therefore exacerbate the cytokine storm observed during COVID-19. Third, recent evidence demonstrated that acute and severe hypouricemia induced in healthy individuals causes endothelial dysfunction, reduces blood pressure, decreases myeloperoxidase activity and increases lipid peroxidation. Lastly, as proximal tubule cells and pneumocytes both express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor mediating viral entry into host cells, we cannot rule out a parallel evolution at the tubular and lung level, resulting from putative direct cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 in both organs. The potential contribution of each of these factors to the relationship between low levels of serum uric acid and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 will require further investigation.

The strengths of this study include the availability of large and well-characterized discovery and validation cohorts; detailed kinetics of serum uric acid; robust outcome analysis; and availability of post-mortem kidney samples for expression studies. We also acknowledge limitations, including the single center design of the study; the lack of mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology linking hypouricemia and respiratory failure; and absence of systematic longitudinal follow-up for all biological parameters.

### Serum uric acid, disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 [^b15daadc]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation in 10–20% of hospitalized patients. Life-threatening COVID-19 is characterized by an acute respiratory distress syndrome, which typically aggravates during in a second phase of the disease driven by an excessive host response. Variability in disease presentation and progression stresses the need for easily available and reliable biomarkers to identify patients at risk of the most severe forms and to provide optimal, personalized care to the individual patient.

COVID-19 is also characterized by extra-pulmonary manifestations involving the gastrointestinal tract, the neurological and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys. We recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 causes a specific dysfunction of the kidney proximal tubule, as attested by the presence of low molecular weight proteinuria, neutral aminoaciduria and defective tubular handling of uric acid. In a cohort of 49 patients with specific urinalysis, inappropriate uricosuria was associated with disease severity and the need for mechanical ventilation. Whether the use of widely available serum uric acid levels can be used as a surrogate for the tubular defect and as a biomarker of disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 has not been assessed.

Here we used two large and independent cohorts of consecutive patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection to investigate and validate the prevalence, kinetics and clinical correlates of hypouricemia in COVID-19.

### Uric acid and cognitive decline: a double-edge sword? [^e30403cf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This narrative review aims to highlight recent findings on the relation between uric acid level and cognitive decline or dementia.

Recent Findings

The antioxidant properties of uric acid, which have supported the hypothesis that uric acid may be neuroprotective, have been questioned by preclinical data. Studies investigating the relation between serum uric acid (SUA) level and Alzheimer disease are mostly cross-sectional, and results are often inconclusive. Similarly, data for an association between uric acid level and cognitive performance are inconsistent. There is some evidence that low SUA level might be associated with Parkinson disease, but studies are limited by methodological heterogeneity and risk of bias. Patients with gout may have decreased risk for Alzheimer disease, but the impact of treatment is unclear. Recent data suggest an increased risk of vascular dementia with high SUA level via increased cerebrovascular burden in older patients. The relation between SUA level and neurologic disorders may be U-shaped.

Summary

We lack strong evidence for an association between low SUA level and cognitive decline over time. Conversely, high SUA level might increase the cerebrovascular burden and the risk of vascular dementia; physicians should continue to treat hyperuricemia when appropriate.

### Low plasma uric acid level in Parkinson's disease [^26c5339d]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Earlier studies suggest that low plasma uric acid level is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), and that uric acid associates with iron-binding proteins. We therefore decided to examine plasma uric acid levels and markers of peripheral iron metabolism in PD patients and healthy controls. For the study, 40 patients with PD and 29 controls underwent clinical screening, laboratory testing, and body mass index (BMI) measurement. The average consumption of different foodstuffs and dairy products was estimated. Plasma uric acid level was significantly lower in the patients than in the controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of plasma iron parameters, but plasma uric acid correlated strongly with serum ferritin both in the patient and the control group. The BMI was slightly lower in the patients compared with the controls despite equal daily calorie consumption. Plasma uric acid level is low in patients with PD, which may have implications for both the disease pathogenesis and treatment recommendations.

### Serum uric acid: a risk factor and a target for treatment? [^0e0e2bdc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Serum uric acid was first noted to be associated with increased BP by Frederick Mohamed in the 1870s. Although the link was rediscovered periodically over the years, it generally was dismissed as a surrogate marker for decreased renal function that led to increased uric acid and increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disease. Recently, however, several lines of evidence suggest that increased serum uric acid may be a significant modifiable risk factor. Increased serum uric acid is associated with increased risk for future hypertension in several large longitudinal clinical trials as well as an independent risk factor for poor CV prognosis. Animal model experiments demonstrate that increased serum uric acid causes increased BP that initially is reversible but becomes irreversible, salt sensitive, and uric acid independent over time. The mechanisms include the direct action of uric acid on smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells. Finally, in adolescents with new-onset essential hypertension, the prevalence of elevated serum uric acid is > 90%, and preliminary clinical trial evidence suggests that agents that lower serum uric acid may lower BP in this select population. Although the investigations are still preliminary, serum uric acid represents a possible new and intriguing target for the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension and CV disease.

### Improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes in gout: what should we target? [^211fa663]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that hyperuricaemia and gout are intricately linked with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. A number of studies suggest that hyperuricaemia and gout are independent risk factors for the development of these conditions and that these conditions account, in part, for the increased mortality rate of patients with gout. In this Review, we first discuss the links between hyperuricaemia, gout and these comorbidities, and present the mechanisms by which uric acid production and gout might favour the development of cardiovascular and renal diseases. We then emphasize the potential benefit of urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with hyperuricaemia. The mechanisms that link elevated serum uric acid levels and gout with these comorbidities seem to be multifactorial, implicating low-grade systemic inflammation and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, as well as the deleterious effects of hyperuricaemia itself. Patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia should be treated by nonpharmacological means to lower their SUA levels. In patients with gout, long-term pharmacological inhibition of XO is a treatment strategy that might also reduce cardiovascular and renal comorbidities, because of its dual effect of lowering SUA levels as well as reducing free-radical production during uric acid formation.

### Pathway for ascertaining the role of uric acid in neurodegenerative diseases [^2d717f56]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism. Elevated serum urate level, a condition known as hyperuricemia, is a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Low urate level, a condition known as hypouricemia, is a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases. The upper normal uric acid levels could range between 6 and 6.8 mg/dL in healthy adults with normal kidney function. Maintaining normal urate levels provides significant antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. High urate levels above saturation threshold (6.8 mg/dL) are considered a pro‐inflammatory condition, leading to increased oxidative stress, increased renin–angiotensin levels, activated aldosterone system, increased systemic vascular resistance, and reduced renal blood flow, and consequently hypertension and worsening kidney function. Low serum urate levels are a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases (Figure 1). Although the exact mechanism that uric acid exerts as a neuroprotective biochemical is not elucidated, it is believed that uric acid levels are scavengers of free radicals, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. Urate levels are responsible for 55% of free radicals' scavenging capacity in the human body. Thus, low uric acid levels could augment the risk of oxidative stress, increasing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which may permeate the effect of tau protein on neuro entanglement, leading to a decline in cognitive function and preclinical neurodegenerative diseases.

### Differences in risk factors for the onset of albuminuria and decrease in glomerular filtration rate in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease [^271c75d8]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What's new?

This was a cohort study showing differences in risk factors for the onset of albuminuria and decreased estimated GFR (< 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus without albuminuria or renal impairment.
Risk factors common to both conditions were diabetic retinopathy, high HbA 1c level and urinary albumin excretion.
Additional risk factors for albuminuria were male gender and elevated uric acid levels. Additional risk factors for decreased estimated GFR were older age, high systolic blood pressure, low estimated GFR and low HDL cholesterol levels.
This study supports the hypothesis that both common and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms are involved in the development of chronic kidney disease in diabetes.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease [^5d4318e1]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which uricemia is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, in light of the available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than gout flares leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial even in the absence of overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors.

Recent studies have provided evidence that uric acid may play a role in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Uric acid is a natural antioxidant that may reduce oxidative stress, a mechanism thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. Higher levels of serum urate (SU) may have a neuroprotective effect. High SU levels reduced the risk of developing PD and correlated with slower PD progression. Among PD patients SU levels were lower as compared with controls. The manipulation of SU levels holds promise in the treatment of PD. It is possible that a high purine diet in patients with PD may slow progression of the disease. Milk and meat consumption as well as exercise modify the risk of developing PD possibly through their influence on SU levels. In this article, we review the association between PD and SU levels and its implication on the management of PD.

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^126e1560]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### Serum uric acid, disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 [^c8fa6693]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Low serum levels of uric acid associate with disease severity and outcome in COVID-19

To assess the clinical relevance of low serum levels of uric acid in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we compared disease severity and outcome of patients with versus without hypouricemia.

In both discovery and validation cohorts, the presence of hypouricemia strongly correlated with disease severity and with established biological parameters of severity, including hsCRP, LDH and nadir lymphocyte count (Fig. 3, Table 2). Considering pooled data from discovery and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients with hypouricemia was 17/151 (11%) among those with mild or moderate; 32/275 (12%) with severe; and 53/92 (58%) with critical disease (Fig. 3 a; Table 2). Patients with critical COVID-19 also had lower serum uric acid levels during hospitalization (median [IQR] 2.0 [1.4–3.9] vs. 3.9 [3.0–5.2], 4.3 [3.3–5.2] and 3.9 [3.1–5.3] mg/dl in patients with severe, moderate and mild disease, respectively, linear trend, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 a). The presence of hypouricemia not only associated with severity of COVID-19, but also with progression of severity during the course of the disease, including 5 (13%) patients who progressed from moderate to severe; 7 (18%) from moderate to critical; and 9 (23%) from severe to critical disease, in the discovery cohort. In the group without hypouricemia, 18 (12%) with moderate progressed to severe, 2 (1.3%) with moderate progressed to critical; and 11 (7%) progressed from severe to critical (P value = 0.006) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

### Uric acid and evolution [^ed228061]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Uric acid (UA) is the end product of purine metabolism in humans due to the loss of uricase activity by various mutations of its gene during the Miocene epoch, which led to humans having higher UA levels than other mammals. Furthermore, 90% of UA filtered by the kidneys is reabsorbed, instead of being excreted. These facts suggest that evolution and physiology have not treated UA as a harmful waste product, but as something beneficial that has to be kept. This has led various researchers to think about the possible evolutionary advantages of the loss of uricase and the subsequent increase in UA levels. It has been argued that due to the powerful antioxidant activity of UA, the evolutionary benefit could be the increased life expectancy of hominids. For other authors, the loss of uricase and the increase in UA could be a mechanism to maintain blood pressure in times of very low salt ingestion. The oldest hypothesis associates the increase in UA with higher intelligence in humans. Finally, UA has protective effects against several neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting it could have interesting actions on neuronal development and function. These hypotheses are discussed from an evolutionary perspective and their clinical significance. UA has some obvious harmful effects, and some, not so well-known, beneficial effects as an antioxidant and neuroprotector.

### Uric acid and hypertension: a focused review and practical recommendations [^d2a75078]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Uric acid levels are higher in humans than in other mammals. Best known as an extracellular antioxidant, uric acid also increases salt sensitivity, fat storage, and lipogenesis. Xanthine oxidase-related oxidative stress may also induce endothelial dysfunction and renal vasoconstriction. Renal structure abnormalities contribute to salt-sensitive and uric acid-independent hypertension. Maternal hyperuricemia during pregnancy and hyperuricemia early in life are likewise independent risk factors for hypertension. Genetic polymorphism is potentially involved in the activity of xanthine oxidoreductase, but further studies are needed. Xanthine oxidase inhibition consistently decreases blood pressure in younger hypertensive patients, albeit modestly. Hyperuricemia affects one out of five adults as a result of the Western diet, insulin resistance, and renal dysfunction. This review advocates lifestyle changes to maintain uric acid levels within the normal range in young (pre)hypertensive individuals or normotensives with a family history of hypertension, metabolic disorders, or obesity; moreover, antihypertensive medications that increase uric acid levels should be avoided.

### The physiology of uric acid and the impact of end-stage kidney disease and dialysis [^43e2ac22]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Uric acid-mediated biological effects are milieu dependent. In a physiological milieu, serum uric acid serves as an antioxidant; when homeostasis is perturbed, divergent effects are observed depending on the clinical context. Several epidemiologic studies indicated the presence of a direct relationship between higher concentrations of serum uric acid and cardiovascular mortality; yet not all studies support this conclusion. Although high serum levels of uric acid are associated with higher mortality in patients with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and perhaps in those with end-stage kidney disease receiving peritoneal dialysis, the opposite relationship is seen in patients with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis. This review discusses the pathologic mechanisms associated with elevated serum uric acid levels by clinical context; examines the interplay between uric acid metabolism and modality of renal replacement therapy; and presents hypotheses to rationalize the disparate associations between incremental levels of serum uric acid and survival across the continuum of kidney disease and by type of renal replacement therapy.

### U-shaped association between serum uric acid level and risk of mortality: a cohort study [^082035b1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

In addition to the controversy regarding the association of hyperuricemia with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, few studies have examined the impact of a low uric acid level on mortality. We undertook the present study to evaluate the relationship between both low and high uric acid levels and the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large sample of Korean adults over a full range of uric acid levels.

Methods

A cohort study was performed in 375,163 South Korean men and women who underwent health check-ups from 2002 to 2012. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained from the national death records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for mortality outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

Results

During a total of 2,060,721.9 person-years of follow-up, 2,020 participants died, with 287 CVD deaths and 963 cancer deaths. Low and high uric acid levels were associated with increased all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. The multivariable-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality in the lowest uric acid categories (< 3.5 mg/dl for men and < 2.5 mg/dl for women) compared with the sex-specific reference category were 1.58 (95% CI 1.18–2.10) and 1.80 (95% CI 1.10–2.93), respectively. Corresponding HRs in the highest uric acid categories (≥ 9.5 mg/dl for men and ≥ 8.5 mg/dl for women) were 2.39 (95% CI 1.57–3.66) and 3.77 (95% CI 1.17–12.17), respectively.

Conclusion

In this large cohort study of men and women, both low and high uric acid levels were predictive of increased mortality, supporting a U-shaped association between serum uric acid levels and adverse health outcomes.

### Serum uric acid and cardiovascular disease: recent developments, and where do they leave us? [^a416d6e5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and cardiovascular disease has been controversial. Here we review recent literature assessing whether hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Studies from the past 6 years evaluating the association of SUA with cardiovascular disease were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library searches, bibliography cross-referencing, and review articles. Twenty-one cohort studies in healthy and high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease were identified and reviewed. In studies of high-risk patients, in which more overall events were recorded, 10 of 11 studies were supportive of an independent association. In 10 studies of healthy patients, 6 suggested an independent association of SUA with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Increasing SUA is likely an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals. However, the magnitude of excess risk attributable to high SUA is likely to be small in healthy individuals. Trials of SUA-lowering therapy in hyperuricemic patients evaluating the effect on cardiovascular outcomes are justified in high-risk patients.

### Uric acid as a target of therapy in CKD [^513fec8e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased and will continue to increase in the United States and worldwide. This is alarming considering that CKD is an irreversible condition and patients who progress to chronic kidney failure have reduced quality of life and high mortality rates. As such, it is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors to develop strategies to slow CKD progression. One such factor is hyperuricemia. Recent observational studies have associated hyperuricemia with kidney disease. In addition, hyperuricemia is largely prevalent in patients with CKD. Data from experimental studies have shown several potential mechanisms by which hyperuricemia may contribute to the development and progression of CKD. In this article, we offer a critical review of the experimental evidence linking hyperuricemia to CKD, highlight gaps in our knowledge on the topic as it stands today, and review the observational and interventional studies that have examined the potential nephroprotective effect of decreasing uric acid levels in patients with CKD. Although uric acid also may be linked to cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with CKD, this review focuses only on uric acid as a potential therapeutic target to prevent kidney disease onset and progression.

### Effects of low birth weight in 8-to 13-year-old children: implications in endothelial function and uric acid levels [^6005d175]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Low birth weight has been associated with an increased incidence of adult cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction and high levels of serum uric acid are associated with hypertension. In this study, we have determined whether uric acid is related to blood pressure and vascular function in children with low birth weight. We evaluated vascular function using high-resolution ultrasound, blood pressure, and uric acid levels in 78 children (35 girls, 43 boys, aged 8 to 13 years). Increasing levels of uric acid and systolic blood pressure were observed in children with low birth weight. Birth weight was inversely associated with both systolic blood pressure and uric acid; on the other hand, uric acid levels were directly correlated with systolic blood pressure in children of the entire cohort. Low birth weight was associated with reduced flow-mediated dilation (r = 0.427, P < 0.001). Because the children with low birth weight had elevated uric acid as well as higher systolic blood pressure levels, we evaluated the correlation between these variables. In the low birth weight group, multiple regression analysis revealed that uric acid (beta = -2.886; SE = 1.393; P = 0.040) had a graded inverse relationship with flow-mediated dilation, which was not affected in a model adjusting for race and gender. We conclude that children with a history of low birth weight show impaired endothelial function and increased blood pressure and uric acid levels. These findings may be early expressions of vascular compromise, contributing to susceptibility to disease in adult life.

### Uric acid nephrolithiasis: proton titration of an essential molecule? [^e2f700d9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The majority of uric acid nephrolithiasis in humans occurs in the absence of frank hyperuricosuria and is primarily a disease of excessively low urinary pH. Uric acid is substantially less soluble than urate salts so in low urine pH urate is protonated, thus favoring precipitation even under what is considered physiologic concentrations of total urinary uric acid/urate. This commentary examines the rationales behind the existence of uric acid in urine and body fluids in vertebrate evolution.

Recent Findings

The purpose of uric acid in arthropod, avian and reptilian species is to enable nitrogen excretion in solid state without loss of water. The re-emergence of uric acid in higher primates as an end product of metabolism is intriguing since urea functions perfectly well as a nitrogenous waste. Uric acid must purvey important physiologic functions in primate biology. Numerous roles of uric acid as an antioxidant, immune signaling molecule, and a defender of circulatory integrity have recently been proposed.

Summary

There is little doubt that uric acid serves multiple important functions in higher primates. It is also conceivable, however, that this important molecule when present in the wrong concentration or context can lead to undesirable phenotypes.

### The role of uric acid in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular disease [^41281a25]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is common in subjects with cardiovascular disease, but is not commonly considered a true risk factor. Recent studies suggest that uric acid is biologically active and can stimulate oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vasoconstriction. Epidemiological studies have found that uric acid can independently predict the development of hypertension, as well as stroke and heart failure. Experimentally raising uric acid in animals increases blood pressure, and pilot studies suggest that lowering uric acid in humans can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. Uric acid may also have emerging roles in the pathogenesis of kidney disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. More studies need to be performed on the pathophysiology and clinical consequences of hyperuricaemia in cardiovascular disease.

### Gout: diagnosis, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations [^3509268c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Gout is a common form of arthritis, in which many of the risk factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and clinical features have been recognized for years. Nevertheless, new information has become available regarding the normal physiologic role of uric acid as an antioxidant, and greater insight has been obtained regarding the inflammatory process in acute gout. New studies have improved our understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors responsible for hyperuricemia, and we know more about the significance of the association of hyperuricemia with other diseases. Clinically, rare complications and disease manifestations in new populations continue to be discussed, and diagnostic methods continue to be refined.

### Uric acid and hypertension: a review of evidence and future perspectives for the management of cardiovascular risk [^e005b867]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is the final product of purine metabolism, and its increased serum levels have been directly involved in the pathogenesis and natural history of hypertension. The relationship between elevated uric acid and hypertension has been proven in both animals and humans, and its relevance is already evident in childhood and adolescent population. The mechanism responsible for blood pressure increase in hyperuricemic subjects is implicating both oxidative stress and intracellular urate activity with a primary involvement of XOR (xanthine-oxidoreductase activity). An increase in the relative risk of hypertension has been confirmed by genetic data and by large meta-analyses of epidemiological data. The effects of urate-lowering treatment on blood pressure control in patients with elevated serum uric acid has been investigated in a small number of reliable studies with a large heterogeneity of patient populations and study designs. However, 2 large meta-analyses suggest a significant effect of urate-lowering treatment on blood pressure, thus confirming the significant relationship between high serum urate and blood pressure. The future research should be focused on a more appropriate identification of patients with cardiovascular hyperuricemia by considering the correct cardiovascular threshold of serum urate, the time-course of uricemia fluctuations, and the identification of reliable markers of urate overproduction that could significantly clarify the clinical and therapeutic implications of the interaction between serum uric acid and hypertension.

### Serum uric acid, disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 [^6eddd7a1]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using two independent cohorts, we showed that low serum levels of uric acid are common among patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and closely associate with disease severity and with the need of mechanical ventilation. Thorough assessment of the kinetics of serum uric acid levels showed an acute and reversible decrease that parallels the development of respiratory failure. The occurrence of hypouricemia was independent from drugs interfering with uric acid production, nephrotoxic medications, treatment received for COVID-19 or viral load, but was associated with defective tubular handling of uric acid and pathological features suggestive of an altered expression of urate transporter in the kidney proximal tubule.

The prevalence of hypouricemia is approximately 0.3% in the general ambulatory population and ranges between 1.2% and 2.5% among hospitalized patients. In our study, 20% of the patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection developed hypouricemia, a proportion that increased to 77% among patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The association between hypouricemia and progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was independent from age, gender, comorbidities and biological parameters of disease severity, suggesting its potential use as a biomarker to identify patients at risk of more severe COVID-19. The high prevalence of hypouricemia in COVID-19 patients is reminiscent of that observed during the 2003 outbreak of SARS, where ~ 25% of patients with SARS-CoV infection developed hypouricemia, with higher rates in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. These findings are also in line with recent data from retrospective cohorts of Chinese patients with COVID-19, in whom low serum levels of uric acid were associated with more severe symptoms and with an increased risk of death.

### Screening for hyperuricaemia and gout: a perspective and research agenda [^f8a68ef4]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

The goal of a screening programme is to reduce an adverse health outcome in a defined population. Screening can be undertaken at several stages throughout the disease course: before the onset of disease, early in the course of the disease, or in established disease (for complications). In the setting of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and gout, the aim of screening would be to identify those individuals with hyperuricaemia and therefore at risk of gout, with the aim of introducing interventions to prevent the onset of gout. Herein we consider the concepts of screening for hyperuricaemia and gout, potential screening methods, and target populations that might benefit from such an approach.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of insulin resistance [^7e8f54da]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction: what is metabolic acidosis and how does it develop?

Metabolic acidosis occurs when there is retention of acid in the body which leads to a drop in the acid buffering capacity of the body. However, acid retention can occur even when serum bicarbonate is normal. There are four mechanisms through which the body can develop metabolic acidosis: (1) increased ingestion of dietary acid, (2) increased production of fixed acid such as in diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis or prolonged fasting, (3) increased loss of base (ie, diarrhoea) and (4) reduced kidney excretion of acid. Additionally, specific medications can cause or contribute to metabolic acidosis.

There are two major types of acid in the body, carbonic acid and non-carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed when a bicarbonate molecule combines with a hydrogen ion. Eventually carbonic acid is turned into water and carbon dioxide. Thus, if we create bicarbonate in the body from alkalinity supplied by the diet then we can breathe out the acid without depleting our own bicarbonate levels. Non-carbonic acids are fixed acids and cannot be exhaled via the lungs. They include lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, uric acid and the ketoacids acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Some of these fixed acids can be excreted in the urine in their free form, however, the urine pH can only drop to around 4.4 and hence only negligible quantities of strong acids, like sulfuric acid, can be eliminated in its free titratable form. So, 99% of the time sulfuric acid must be turned into hydrogen ions and sulfate and then it can be eliminated by the body.

### Education and non-pharmacological approaches for gout [^c6260a82]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this review are as follows: to highlight the gaps in patient and physician knowledge of gout and how this might impede optimal disease management; to provide recommended core knowledge points that should be conveyed to people with gout; and to review non-pharmacological interventions that can be used in gout management. MeSH terms were used to identify eligible studies examining patients' and health-care professionals' knowledge about gout and its management. A narrative review of non-pharmacological management of gout is provided. Many health-care professionals have significant gaps in their knowledge about gout that have the potential to impede optimal management. Likewise, people with gout and the general population lack knowledge about causes, consequences and treatment of this condition. Full explanation about gout, including the potential benefits of urate-lowering treatment (ULT), motivates people with gout to want to start such treatment, and there is evidence, albeit limited, that educational interventions can improve uptake and adherence to ULT. Additionally, several non-pharmacological approaches, such as rest and topical ice application for acute attacks, avoidance of risk factors that can trigger acute attacks, and dietary interventions that may reduce gout attack frequency (e.g. cherry or cherry juice extract, skimmed milk powder or omega-3 fatty acid intake) or lower serum uric acid (e.g. vitamin C), can be used as adjuncts to ULT. There is a pressing need to educate health-care professionals, people with gout and society at large to remove the negative stereotypes associated with gout, which serve as barriers to optimal gout management, and to perceive gout as a significant medical condition. Moreover, there is a paucity of high-quality trial evidence on whether certain simple individual dietary and lifestyle factors can reduce the risk of recurrent gout attacks, and further studies are required in this field.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^fc6a2400]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### Serum uric acid levels and risk of metabolic syndrome: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies [^f7c0a3f0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

An excess circulating uric acid level, even within the normal range, is always comorbid with metabolic syndrome (MS), several of its components, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which was regarded as hepatic manifestation of MS; however, these associations remain controversial.

Objective

This study aimed to quantitatively assess the relationship between the serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the MS/NAFLD risk.

Design

We searched for related prospective cohort studies including SUA as an exposure and MS/NAFLD as a result in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE databases up to January 31, 2015 and July 28, 2015, respectively. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted. A random-effects model was used to evaluate dose-response relationships.

Main Outcomes

On the basis of 11 studies (54 970 participants and 8719 MS cases), a combined RR of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.45–2.03; P < .0001) was observed for the highest SUA level category compared with the lowest SUA level category. Furthermore, based on nine studies (51 249 participants and 8265 MS cases), dose-response analysis suggested that each 1 mg/dL SUA increment was roughly linearly associated with the MS risk (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.22–1.38; P < .0001). Beyond that, SUA level increased NAFLD risk (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31–1.63). Each 1 mg/dL SUA level increment led to 21% increase in the NAFLD risk.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that higher SUA levels led to an increased risk of MS regardless of the study characteristics, and were consistent with a linear dose-response relationship. In addition, SUA was also a causal factor for the NAFLD risk.

### Hyperuricemia, gout and the metabolic syndrome [^49eed4eb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The metabolic syndrome is defined by the clustering of a number of cardiovascular risk factors and entails an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality from both cardiovascular disease and all causes. In the present paper, we review the most recent evidence on the association between hyperuricemia, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.

Recent Findings

Serum urate is frequently elevated in patients with the metabolic syndrome and increases with the number of components of this condition. Hyperuricemia has been related to decreased renal uric acid excretion, which may be mediated by enhanced proximal tubular sodium reabsorption and hyperinsulinemia. Recent epidemiologic studies have shed some light on the prognosis of hyperuricemia. While hyperuricemia appears to show a benign significance in low cardiovascular risk individuals, it clearly increases cardiovascular mortality in patients at high cardiovascular disease risk.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware of the presence of metabolic syndrome in patients with hyperuricemia or gout in order to control its components (high blood pressure, obesity, etc.) and hence reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Long-term, randomized interventional clinical trials are needed to test the hypothesis that urate-lowering therapy can reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients.

American College of Rheumatology 2020 gout guideline — serum urate (SU) targets and thresholds — clarifies that the guideline does not specify SU thresholds beyond < 6 mg/dl for severe disease subsets, acknowledges evidence linking lower SU with improved outcomes but notes there are no trial data to support lower specific thresholds, and identifies a research need regarding the safety of prolonged hypouricemia at SU ≤ 3 mg/dl.

### Gout [^903698b8]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

### Association of uric acid levels before start of conditioning with mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-a prospective, non-interventional study of the EBMT transplant complication working party [^b74dafc4]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is a danger signal contributing to inflammation. Its relevance to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) derives from preclinical models where the depletion of uric acid led to improved survival and reduced graft- versus -host disease (GvHD). In a clinical pilot trial, peri-transplant uric acid depletion reduced acute GvHD incidence. This prospective international multicenter study aimed to investigate the association of uric acid serum levels before start of conditioning with alloSCT outcome. We included patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving a first matched sibling alloSCT from peripheral blood, regardless of conditioning. We compared outcomes between patients with high and low uric acid levels with univariate- and multivariate analysis using a cause-specific Cox model. Twenty centers from 10 countries reported data on 366 alloSCT recipients. There were no significant differences in terms of baseline comorbidity and disease stage between the high- and low uric acid group. Patients with uric acid levels above median measured before start of conditioning did not significantly differ from the remaining in terms of acute GvHD grades II-IV incidence (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.5, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.0–2.4, P = 0.08). However, they had significantly shorter overall survival (HR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7–4.7, P < 0.0001) and progression free survival (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1–2.4, P = 0.025). Non-relapse mortality was significantly increased in alloSCT recipients with high uric acid levels (HR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4–5.0, P = 0.003). Finally, the incidence of relapse after alloSCT was increased in patients with higher uric acid levels (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0–2.5, P = 0.04). We conclude that high uric acid levels before the start of conditioning correlate with increased mortality after alloSCT.

### Serum uric acid levels and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of evidence from observational studies, randomised controlled trials, and mendelian randomisation studies [^43c1a3a1]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To map the diverse health outcomes associated with serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Design Umbrella review. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and screening of citations and references. Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between SUA level and health outcomes, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials that investigated health outcomes related to SUA lowering treatment, and Mendelian randomisation studies that explored the causal associations of SUA level with health outcomes. Results 57 articles reporting 15 systematic reviews and144 meta-analyses of observational studies (76 unique outcomes), 8 articles reporting 31 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (20 unique outcomes), and 36 articles reporting 107 Mendelian randomisation studies (56 unique outcomes) met the eligibility criteria. Across all three study types, 136 unique health outcomes were reported. 16 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of observational studies had P < 10–6, 8 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials had P < 0.001, and 4 unique outcomes in Mendelian randomisation studies had P < 0.01. Large between study heterogeneity was common (80% and 45% in meta-analyses of observational studies and of randomised controlled trials, respectively). 42 (55%) meta-analyses of observational studies and 7 (35%) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showed evidence of small study effects or excess significance bias. No associations from meta-analyses of observational studies were classified as convincing; five associations were classified as highly suggestive (increased risk of heart failure, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose or diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease mortality with high SUA levels). Only one outcome from randomised controlled trials (decreased risk of nephrolithiasis recurrence with SUA lowering treatment) had P < 0.001, a 95% prediction interval excluding the null, and no large heterogeneity or bias. Only one outcome from Mendelian randomisation studies (increased risk of gout with high SUA levels) presented convincing evidence. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease showed concordant evidence in meta-analyses of observational studies, and in some (but not all) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials with respective intermediate or surrogate outcomes, but they were not statistically significant in Mendelian randomisation studies. Conclusion Despite a few hundred systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomisation studies exploring 136 unique health outcomes, convincing evidence of a clear role of SUA level only exists for gout and nephrolithiasis.

We carried out a cross-sectional study to compare serum uric acid levels between PSP patients, PD patients, and healthy controls. We also analyzed longitudinal uric acid levels in the PSP group.

Results

PSP patients showed reduced levels of serum uric acid as compared to healthy controls. This reduction was similar to that found in patients with PD. Uric acid levels of PSP patients did not change with time.

Conclusion

Serum uric acid levels are reduced in PSP as well as in PD compared to healthy controls. Our data suggest that high levels of uric acid could be a natural protective factor against PSP.

### Uric acid-lowering therapy and incident chronic kidney disease… [^74e1a6cf]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Baseline characteristics, including serum uric acid level, were similar among treated and untreated patients after propensity score weighting. In the overall cohort, uric acid–lowering therapy was associated with higher risk of both incident eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and incident albuminuria but was not associated with the risk of end-stage kidney disease. In subgroup analyses, the association of uric acid–lowering therapy with worse kidney outcomes was limited to patients with baseline serum uric acid levels of 8 mg/dL or less. A causal effect of uric acid on CKD could be proven by demonstrating an impact of therapeutic urate lowering on kidney outcomes.

Recent clinical trials of urate lowering in patients with existing CKD did not document a reduction in CKD progression, 29, 30 but the effects of urate lowering on the incidence of new-onset CKD are less clear. We examined the association of uric acid–lowering therapy with the incidence of various kidney outcomes in a large cohort of US veterans with no preexisting CKD. We hypothesized that lowering urate levels is independently associated with a lower incidence of new-onset kidney disease. Our findings of higher risk of incident CKD and albuminuria in patients with less severe elevations of serum uric concentration treated with urate lowering therapy may appear surprising, as we hypothesized that the lowering of uric acid levels would be beneficial owing to the detrimental effects of uric acid on various metabolic and cardiovascular processes.

This cohort study found that uric acid–lowering therapy was not associated with beneficial kidney outcomes, including the incidence of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, albuminuria, or ESKD. Uric acid–lowering therapy was associated with a higher risk of new-onset CKD, including both the development of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and new-onset albuminuria, in patients with baseline serum uric acid levels of 8 mg/dL or lower.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^9a24a259]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

The second pathway that helps to eliminate acid in the body is from an increased secretion of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules. Even with mild acidosis, the quantity and activity of the Na⁺/H⁺ ion exchanger in the kidneys is increased, leading to H⁺ elimination but concomitant sodium reabsorption. The overall effects on urinary sodium are still not conclusive, however, as data suggest that metabolic acidosis increases the loss of sodium out in the urine, potentially due to tubulointerstitial damage, and loss in the capacity of the kidneys to reabsorb sodium.

The third elimination pathway for acid out the body is combining citrate to hydrogen ions. When we accumulate acid, citrate excretion in the urine goes down because it is reabsorbed back into the body by the tubular cells of the kidney. Thus, in states of low-grade metabolic acidosis the urine will contain less citrate. Citrate (citrate³⁻) can accept three protons forming uncharged citric acid. This eventually gets broken down into water and carbon dioxide eliminating 3H⁺ ions. However, the reduction in citrate in the urine increases the risk of kidney stones. The reduction in urinary citrate leads to less citrate to bind to urinary calcium ions, which form more soluble calcium-citrate-complexes compared with oxalic acid. Thus, calcium-oxalate kidney stones can be caused by low-grade metabolic acidosis, which may be improved with increasing dietary bicarbonate or citrate.

The fourth and final buffering system is the release of minerals (and their organic anions, like phosphate and carbonate) from the bones and cellular compartments. Studies from in the 1960s confirmed that high dietary acid loads increase the breakdown of bone. In fact, mild acidosis increases osteoclast activity and decreases osteoblast activity leading to increased bone breakdown and decreased bone building, respectively. This can cause an increase in the release of calcium and phosphorus from bone, higher calcium level in the urine and an increased risk of calcium-oxalate kidney stones.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — dietary approaches for hyperuricemia/gout in CKD: High alcohol intake, high purine intake, and consumption of carbonated drinks are associated with higher levels of serum uric acid. In people with a history of gout, higher versus moderate alcohol intake (≥ 30 units/wk vs. < 20 units/wk) and higher median purine intake (≥ 850 mg vs. < 850 mg) are associated with higher serum uric acid and recurrence risk. Experimentally, 2 hours after ingestion of 1 g/kg of body weight of fructose, serum uric acid increases by 1–2 mg/dl (59.5–119 μmol/l), and carbonated drinks are observationally associated with higher serum uric acid concentrations and incident gout, whereas diet versions are not. Foods associated with a low incidence of gout include low-fat dairy and high-fiber and plant-based diets.

### Investigating the relationship between serum uric acid to high-density lipoprotein ratio and metabolic syndrome [^31668f30]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

Metabolic syndrome refers to the existence of a set of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. People with metabolic syndrome are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes than others. Some of these influencing factors include dyslipidaemia, central or visceral obesity and insulin resistance.

Recent epidemiological studies have shown that the risk factors of metabolic syndrome cannot justify all cardiovascular events. In recent studies, in addition to these factors, other factors such as inflammatory markers, microalbuminuria and hyperuricaemia have been suggested to justify these events. Some of these studies have suggested that insulin resistance is the underlying cause of metabolic syndrome. Increased insulin secretion may increase blood uric acid levels due to its role in reducing renal excretion of uric acid and sodium, thereby affecting cardiovascular events. Studies have also shown that high serum uric acid levels increase the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease compared to normal levels.

Uric acid is a product of purine catabolism that causes insulin resistance and increasing atherosclerosis by reducing the production of nitric oxide, the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial dysfunction. According to a study by Duman et al. serum uric acid levels in patients with poor control diabetes are significantly higher than in patients with well‐controlled diabetes and there is a strong significant correlation between serum uric acid levels and HbA1c. In addition, elevated uric acid levels may indicate a cellular level of damage and serve as a prognostic marker in patients with pre‐diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, serum uric acid level can be considered as a prognostic parameter in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Recent studies also show a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in people with hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia is a laboratory disorder that is more common in children, but because the diagnostic value of uric acid alone is low, paediatricians often do not examine its serum level. The results of some studies indicate a strong relationship between uric acid levels and metabolic syndrome in adults and children and have suggested various mechanisms to justify this relationship.

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^dc5b2130]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Physiological serum uric acid concentrations correlate with arterial stiffness in a sex-dependent manner [^4857c232]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular diseases are a still growing clinical and public health problem, with established risk factors but also additional influencing factors that are poorly understood, like uric acid. Unlike in many other mammals, in humans, uric acid is the final product of endogenous and dietary purine metabolism due to an evolutionary loss of uricase activity. As a weak acid, the majority of uric acid circulates in the blood as urate. When the solubility limit of around 360–420 µmol/l is exceeded, urate crystals may form and precipitate. It is estimated that ~ 700 mg urate per day have to be excreted by adults, mainly by the kidneys, to maintain the steady-state concentrations. Of note, 500 to 600 mg per day are produced endogenously predominantly in the liver and to a minor part in the small intestine. A crucial metabolic step during urate formation is mediated by xanthine oxidase at the end of the purine pathway. Diet can enhance the urate load by either direct uptake of nucleotides or enhanced ingestion of fructose that enhances adenosine monophosphate formation.

Physiological uric acid concentrations have been assessed in individuals without evidence of gout to range between 210 and 420 µmol/l in adult males and postmenopausal women and between 160 and 360 µmol/l in premenopausal women. However, the meaning of these cut-offs is under continuous debates, as there is evidence that uric acid might play a pathophysiological role in cardiovascular and renal disorders even in concentrations lying within the physiological range. It has been suggested that an upper threshold value of 360 µmol/l should be considered for all individuals.

In human kidney, urate is freely filtered in the glomeruli but reabsorbed to more than 90% in the proximal tubule, mainly by the apical transporter URAT1. In parallel, urate is also secreted into the proximal tubule, leading to a fractional excretion of ~ 10%. URAT1 is an important determinant of reabsorption and is the target of uricosuric drugs such as probenecid. Long-term treatment with diuretics at higher doses can reduce urate excretion, either by enhanced reabsorption in the proximal tubule or competition for secretory mechanisms in proximal tubule cells. Hyperuricemia results in more than 90% of the cases from an inappropriate renal excretion, defined as the shift towards higher steady-state serum uric acid concentrations when handling the daily incoming urate.

### Uric acid as a potential cue to screen for iron overload [^78821dbd]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It is suggested that targeted screening for hemochromatosis and iron overload may be worthwhile. The aim of this study was to examine uric acid as a potential indicator of the presence of iron overload.

Methods

We analyzed adults aged 20 and older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2002. We computed logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, liver or kidney condition, and alcohol use to see the relationship between combinations of uric acid and ferritin with the outcomes of elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria.

Results

In unadjusted analyses, 20.7% of individuals with high uric acid had high ferritin levels versus 8.8% of individuals with low uric acid levels (P < .001). Individuals with both elevated uric acid and elevated ferritin levels had significantly higher liver enzymes than individuals with either elevated uric acid or ferritin. With low uric acid and low ferritin as the reference category, individuals with high uric acid and high ferritin were significantly more likely to also have proteinuria (odds ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.82–3.91).

Conclusions

Elevated levels of uric acid is associated with elevated ferritin levels and may serve as a risk stratification variable for presence of iron overload and hemochromatosis.

### Association between elevated serum uric acid levels and high estimated glomerular filtration rate with reduced risk of low muscle strength in older people: a retrospective cohort study [^7dc01705]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this was the first cohort study that investigated the causal relationship between serum uric acid and the risk of low muscle strength at different eGFR levels above 60 years population. Our results suggested that high uric acid levels only provide a protective effect against low muscle strength when accompanied by high eGFR levels, especially in older females.

These results help to clarify conflicts among previous studies. Some cross-sectional studies reported a positive association between higher uric acid levels and better grip strength. However, these studies did not account for the influence of eGFR or adjust for eGFR as a confounding factor, potentially leading to misleading conclusions regarding the effect of uric acid on muscle strength. In contrast, our study at baseline excluded individuals who already had low muscle strength to minimize the impact of this population, ensuring a causal relationship between uric acid and muscle strength. Our study is in line with the findings of a Korean study that excluded populations with eGFR < 60 and demonstrated a positive association between SUA and grip strength in older people. Moreover, Nahas et al. also adjusted for eGFR and other confounders, showing that older men and women may benefit from higher SUA levels for better handgrip strength. Thus, our study, along with the abovementioned studies, suggests that a high eGFR level may act as a protective factor, allowing serum uric acid levels to positively impact muscular strength.

We have observed that different eGFR levels can lead to contrasting effects of SUA on the risk of LMS in both men and women. However, the underlying mechanism by which a high serum level of SUA is associated with a decreased risk of LMS in varying eGFR conditions remains uncertain. Many studies have proposed that SUA may exhibit antioxidant properties by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing oxidative stress. Nevertheless, this hypothesis may require further exploration, especially concerning lower eGFR levels. The accumulation of SUA due to declining kidney function may be influenced by alterations in the body's chemical environment, potentially affecting the antioxidant ability of uric acid. For instance, the accumulation of bicarbonate, often seen in renal insufficiency-related electrolyte disturbances, might compromise uric acid's capacity to counteract tyrosine nitrosylation, a crucial mechanism of oxidative damage.

### Serum uric acid levels and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of evidence from observational studies, randomised controlled trials, and mendelian randomisation studies [^33e995d8]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Evidence from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials was assessed in terms of the significance of the summary effect (P < 0.01, 0.01 ≤ P < 0.05, P ≥ 0.05), 95% prediction interval (excluding the null or not), and presence of large heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%), small study effects (P > 0.10), and excess significance (P > 0.10). We also noted the conclusions from any evidence classification (GRADEor equivalent system) applied by the original meta-analyses. Finally, we assessed the evidence from individual Mendelian randomisation studies for statistical significance of the effect estimate (P < 0.01) and of the statistical power (> 80%).

For overlapping outcomes that were investigated in meta-analyses of observational studies and/or meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and/or individual Mendelian randomisation studies, we examined if the direction and statistical significance of the associations were reported concordantly across the different study types. We noted the overlapping outcomes that were graded as class I or II in meta-analyses of observational studies and had a 95% prediction interval excluding the null in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. For these outcomes we also presented the evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies if available.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^1b5a3ff1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

### Association between 25 hydroxyvitamin D and serum uric acid level in the Chinese general population: a cross-sectional study [^2ba4b9c2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Backgroud

The relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has been variably characterized in existing literature, with inconsistent results regarding its nature and implications in the Chinese population. This study aims to clarify this association, considering the potential impact of vitamin D levels on SUA.

Methods

This cross-sectional study involved 7,086 individuals from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, screened throughout 2020. We collected data on 25(OH)D, SUA, and other metabolic markers. Logistic regression models adjusted for confounding factors were utilized to analyze the relationships.

Results

Our findings illustrate a statistically significant inverted U-shaped relationship between 25(OH)D and SUA. The identified threshold effect at 28.82 ng/ml is pivotal; with 25(OH)D levels below this point associated with an increased risk of hyperuricemia (odds ratio: 1.0146, p = 0.0148), and levels above it offering protective benefits (odds ratio: 0.9616, p = 0.0164).

Conclusions

Our findings confirm a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped correlation between 25(OH)D and SUA, emphasizing the importance of maintaining vitamin D levels within a specific range to effectively manage hyperuricemia. These results support the implementation of personalized vitamin D supplementation strategies to optimize metabolic health outcomes, highlighting the complex interplay between vitamin D status and uric acid levels.

### Novel insights into the pathogenesis of uric acid nephrolithiasis [^4826472c]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The factors involved in the pathogenesis of uric acid nephrolithiasis are well known. A low urinary pH is the most significant element in the generation of stones, with hyperuricosuria being a less common finding. The underlying mechanism(s) responsible for these disturbances remain poorly characterized. This review summarizes previous knowledge and highlights some recent developments in the pathophysiology of low urine pH and hyperuricosuria.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological and metabolic studies have indicated an association between uric acid nephrolithiasis and insulin resistance. Some potential mechanisms include impaired ammoniagenesis caused by resistance to insulin action in the renal proximal tubule, or substrate competition by free fatty acids. The evaluation of a large Sicilian kindred recently revealed a putative genetic locus linked to uric acid stone disease. The identification of novel complementary DNA has provided an interesting insight into the renal handling of uric acid, including one genetic cause of renal uric acid wasting.

Summary

The recognition of metabolic, molecular, and genetic factors that influence urinary pH, and uric acid metabolism and excretion, will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of uric acid stones, and open the way for new therapeutic strategies.

### Uric acid lowering therapies for preventing or delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease [^875a9358]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-randomised data have shown a link between hyperuricaemia and the progression or development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). If this is correct, urate lowering therapy might form an important part of chronic kidney disease care, reducing risks for cardiovascular outcomes and end-stage kidney disease.

Objectives

This review aims to study the benefits and harms of uric acid lowering therapy on the progression of CKD and other cardiovascular endpoints.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 20 July 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials testing primary urate lowering therapy in patients with or without CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used.

Main Results

Twelve studies (1187 participants) were included in the review. Risk of bias was unclear for the majority of domains in each study. Uric acid lowering therapy may make little or no difference in death at six months (2 studies, 498 participants: RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.48) or two years (2 studies, 220 participants): RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.06) (low certainty evidence). Uric acid lowering therapy may make little of no difference (low certainty evidence) in the incidence of ESKD at one or two years. Kidney function may be improved by uric acid lowering therapy at one year with a reduction in serum creatinine (2 studies, 83 participants: MD -73.35 µmol/L, 95% CI -107.28 to -39.41) and a rise in eGFR (1 study, 113 participants: MD 5.50 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 0.59 to 10.41). However it probably makes little or no difference to eGFR at two years (2 studies, 164 participants: MD 4.00 mL/min, 95% CI -3.28 to 11.28). Uric acid lowering therapy reduced uric acid levels at all time points (3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months) (high certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support an effect on blood pressure, proteinuria or other cardiovascular markers by uric acid lowering therapy. It should be noted that the apparent benefits of treatment were not apparent at all time points, introducing the potential for bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited data which suggests uric acid lowering therapy may prevent progression of chronic kidney disease but the conclusion is very uncertain. Benefits were not observed at all time points and study quality was generally low. Larger studies are required to study the effect of uric acid lowering therapy on CKD progression. Three ongoing studies will hopefully provide much needed high quality data.

### Serum uric acid and fatal myocardial infarction: detection of prognostic cut-off values: the URRAH (uric acid right for heart health) study [^fb6ee9e4]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

About serum uric acid as a risk factor

During the last few decades, a large number of epidemiological studies have reported an association between serum uric acid (SUA) and cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease (CAD), and literature shows an increasing interest for the direct deleterious impact of the synergistic effect of SUA on other cardiovascular risk factors. Uric acid is the final product of nucleic acid metabolism, and its production is controlled by a multitude of different factors, including dietary intake of various foods, renal excretion, and rate of uric acid cell turnover.

The problem of cut-off values

SUA is often taken into consideration by researchers and clinicians as a continuous variable, but they would strongly prefer to use cut-off values, that are more useful in clinical setting. Different SUA values have been proposed as 'normal' in many countries based on cross-sectional studies or even on the reports of public and private laboratories. Different levels above 6 mg/dl are usually considered as pathologic. However, observational cut-off does not have necessarily a prognostic value, and a growing body of evidences suggests that SUA might exert a detrimental influence on the cardiovascular system, brain and kidney and also negatively influence glucose metabolism for circulating levels below the saturation limit, indicating its effects is in part independent of precipitation of urate monosodium crystals. Indeed, some studies demonstrated that the relation between SUA and cardiovascular disease is evident not only in the presence of the so-called overt hyperuricemia or gout, but also with SUA levels usually considered in the normal-to-high range.

### The association of uric acid with mortality modifies at old age: data from the uric acid right for heart health (URRAH) study [^6a73db6b]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Our data from a sample of 8000 URRAH participants aged 65 or older provided evidence supporting the predictive value of SUA for all-cause and CV mortality in older individuals, but also confirmed that this association is complex and strongly age-related. In the younger subgroup of our study sample (65–74 years) both all-cause and CV mortality increased at higher SUA levels, with the same cut-off value of 4.8 mg/dl discriminating mortality status. This prognostic threshold was similar to the one reported in the overall URRAH database for all-cause mortality (4.7 mg/dl), but slightly lower than the one reported for CV mortality (5.6 mg/dl). In the older subgroup of our sample (participants aged 75 or older), SUA as a continuous variable was not associated with all-cause and CV mortality when adjusting for confounders including comorbidities and other CV risk factors. Yet, a J-shaped association was observed between SUA levels and mortality risk when participants were grouped according to SUA quartiles, in agreement with previous studies. We may thus observe that the prognostic role of SUA significantly modifies with age, similarly to what reported for other CV risk factors. Indeed, it is well known that the association of many CV risk factors with adverse events attenuates or even inverts at advanced age, thus resulting in the phenomenon of "risk factor reversal" (or "risk factor paradoxes"). In older adults, body mass index values in the high-normal to overweight ranges seem to carry a lower risk of adverse outcomes than being low-normal or underweight, a phenomenon which is referred to as "obesity paradox". Similarly, hypertension appears to be a less prominent risk factor in older age. Aging is associated with a progressive attenuation in the protective effects of lower blood pressure and some degrees of hypertension are suggested to have survival advantage or at least no survival disadvantage at advanced age, particularly in the presence of frailty and cognitive impairment. Finally, the role of cholesterol as a risk factor in the geriatric population is controversial. Numerous epidemiological studies support the presence of the "cholesterol paradox" in older adults, suggesting that increasing cholesterol levels provide survival advantage over lower levels, mainly due to lower mortality from cancer and infections. In accordance with this evidence, our study described an inverse association between total cholesterol and all-cause mortality, particularly in individuals aged 75 or older.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^2a46285c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical impact and outcome evidence — Of the clinical manifestations of hyperuricemia, gout is the most common. Evidence that hyperuricemia causes or contributes to progressive kidney disease or cardiovascular disease is weak. A large registry cohort demonstrated associations of gout with elevated mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.47) and graft loss (adjusted hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.49). There are no RCTs to show that lowering uric acid levels is associated with better graft survival, kidney function or patient survival; one small trial (n = 54) in transplant patients with kidney impairment found improved function with uric acid reduction that failed to reach statistical significance, and case series have not shown a consistent benefit of uric acid reduction on kidney function in CKD.

### Drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout [^5b2dd157]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is a common clinical condition that can be defined as a serum uric acid level > 6.8 mg/dl (404 µmol/l). Gout, a recognized complication of hyperuricaemia, is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults. Drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout present an emergent and increasingly prevalent problem in clinical practice. Diuretics are one of the most important causes of secondary hyperuricaemia. Drugs raise serum uric acid level by an increase of uric acid reabsorption and/or decrease in uric acid secretion. Several drugs may also increase uric acid production. In this review, drugs leading to hyperuricaemia are summarized with regard to their mechanism of action and clinical significance. Increased awareness of drugs that can induce hyperuricaemia and gout, and monitoring and prevention are key elements for reducing the morbidity related to drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout.

### High plasma uric acid concentration: causes and consequences [^59a1465d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Fruit and vegetables, in addition to flavonoids, can contain other nutrients that can affect the plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Lotito & Frei (2006) reported that the TAC increase observed after the intake of these flavonoid-rich food types is not specifically caused by flavonoids because such nutrients are probably highly metabolized after ingestion. Possibly, what would increase TAC would be the UA elevation resulting from fructose metabolism. The mechanism for such elevation would be the degradation of purine nucleotides or UA excretion reduction.

High vitamin-C intake shows an inverse relation with UA as such vitamin has a uricosuric effect due to competition of UA renal resorption through a change in the anion transportation system in the proximal tubule.

Beer intake is an independent factor from UA increase both due to its alcoholic content and high-quality purine. Beer intake has a stronger power to increase UA than liqueur, but moderate wine intake does not increase UA. Alcohol intake increases UA concentrations by reducing excretion and increasing urate production.

Dairy product intake has an inverse relation with UA. Probably, the mechanism for such association is due to milk-forming proteins (lactalbumin and casein), which have a uricosuric effect.

There is an inverse relation between coffee intake and UA concentrations, but such association seems to be due to other substances, as it does not seem to result from caffeine. Decreased UA concentrations would result from the improved insulin resistance observed with increased coffee intake, which occurs mainly due to chlorogenic acid, an antioxidant found in that drink.

Tsunoda et al. (2002) observed the effects of hypocaloric diets on uric acid in overweight individuals. This type of diet indirectly decreased UA serum concentrations because it improved insulin sensitivity in these individuals, and this occurred regardless of changes in body weight or blood pressure.

### An update on the genetics of hyperuricaemia and gout [^81f71844]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

A central aspect of the pathogenesis of gout is elevated urate concentrations, which lead to the formation of monosodium urate crystals. The clinical features of gout result from an individual's immune response to these deposited crystals. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed the importance of urate excretion in the control of serum urate levels and the risk of gout and have identified the kidneys, the gut and the liver as sites of urate regulation. The genetic contribution to the progression from hyperuricaemia to gout remains relatively poorly understood, although genes encoding proteins that are involved in the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome pathway play a part. Genome-wide and targeted sequencing is beginning to identify uncommon population-specific variants that are associated with urate levels and gout. Mendelian randomization studies using urate-associated genetic variants as unconfounded surrogates for lifelong urate exposure have not supported claims that urate is causal for metabolic conditions that are comorbidities of hyperuricaemia and gout. Genetic studies have also identified genetic variants that predict responsiveness to therapies (for example, urate-lowering drugs) for treatment of hyperuricaemia. Future research should focus on large GWAS (that include asymptomatic hyperuricaemic individuals) and on increasing the use of whole-genome sequencing data to identify uncommon genetic variants with increased penetrance that might provide opportunities for clinical translation.

Conclusion

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is a common phenomenon in the Western world. We have provided several ways for clinicians to test for metabolic acidosis and strategies to neutralise a high dietary acid load. A greater emphasis on low-grade metabolic acidosis should be provided during medical school so that clinicians are more aware of this condition and how to treat it.

### Uric acid: a marker of increased cardiovascular risk [^89b9c8db]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

The relationship between uric acid and cardiovascular disease has been known since the 19th century, after that many authors reported the classical association of gout, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease. With the exception of specific genetic defects in purine metabolism, increased uric acid is generally associated with important risk factors for atherosclerosis like hypertension, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and renal failure. Studies have clearly shown an association between increased uric acid concentrations with oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, subclinical atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Increased uric acid levels are independent markers of cardiovascular disease risk. Prospective studies are necessary to show that reduction of uric acid levels prevent cardiovascular events.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^11b1b961]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Implementation and safety — Uric acid–lowering therapy in CKD: There are several generic xanthine oxidase inhibitors that are well tolerated and widely available at low cost, and in most countries the cost and availability of uric acid–lowering therapies make the medications very accessible. The risk of serious adverse events (e.g. Stevens–Johnson syndrome) is related to the presence of specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) *B5801, which is more common in those of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and African descent; in specific regions, assessment of the HLA type is recommended before commencing the drug, and where testing is not available, close monitoring at initiation of the medication should be undertaken. At the current time, there is no indication to commence medication for high serum uric acid levels in the absence of symptoms, and uric acid–lowering therapy reduces uric acid levels and their associated symptomatic joint and skin complications, and are generally safe to use.

### Severe hypouricemia impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and reduces blood pressure in healthy young men: a randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover study [^7eb594d4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The XO isoform of the XOR enzyme is involved in purine metabolism and production of ROS. 17 XO, along with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and decoupled endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), is a major contributor to ROS production. 18 Endothelial dysfunction is the result of impaired NO bioavailability, resulting from the imbalance of antioxidant and oxidant factors (ROS).

More potent and better tolerated therapies may allow patients to experience lower levels of UA than previously. There is growing concern that low levels of UA may prove deleterious. The recent CARES (Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients with Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities) trial showed that more cardiovascular deaths occurred in patients treated with febuxostat compared with those treated with allopurinol. 19 A larger proportion of febuxostat‐treated patients reached a UA concentration < 300 μmol/L (< 5 mg/dL). This trial, however, had several methodological pitfalls. Our study aims to provide a timely, in‐depth insight of the cardiovascular consequences of acute hypouricemia. We believe that studying the effects of different levels of UA reduction is of importance because of lack of data about the threshold to initiate urate‐lowering therapies, 1 especially as UA has been suggested to increase the risk of hypertension in younger subjects. 4

### Association of uric acid levels before start of conditioning with mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-a prospective, non-interventional study of the EBMT transplant complication working party [^556d51f2]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study contradicts results from a previous retrospective single centre study, which did not show any significant association of uric acid levels prior to transplantation to mortality after alloSCT. Differences in study designs between the current larger, multicentre and prospective study versus the already published smaller, single centre and retrospective study may be the reason for the differing results.

A limitation of this clinical study is the lack of mechanistic insight on the role of uric acid in development of complications after alloSCT. The study design did not allow the investigation of whether the impaired outcome in the high urid acid cohort is due to an active role of uric acid in causing inflammation or whether it is because uric acid primarily is a surrogate biomarker reflecting a hyperinflammatory status and/or activity of the underlying malignancy. However, we found no significant differences regarding the disease status as well as disease risk index (DRI) (complete remission [CR] vs. non-CR) in between the two groups (high uric acid vs.low uric acid). In addition there were no significant differences in the performance status as well as the alloSCT-CI in between the two groups. This data is no proof, but rather points in the direction that high uric acid values were not merely a reflection of advanced disease or increased comorbidity in our study.

A further limitation of our results is that our patient population was restricted to alloSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors. We are therefore unable to draw definite conclusions from these results regarding the association of uric acid levels with outcome in matched unrelated donor alloSCT or in haploidentical alloSCT, which are increasingly used. Another limitation is the incomplete under-standing of the effects of uric acid on post alloSCT immunity. While previous studies showed that uric acid leads to a inflammatory status in leukocytes and our results demonstrate impaired survival in alloSCT recipients with uric acid levels above median, it may be premature to conclude that uric acid is a negative factor at any time around alloSCT. There are clinical situations where immune activation is necessary and desired – e.g. in anti-infectious and anti-tumor immunity. The impact of depleting uric acid on immune activity in these situations remains to be deter-mined. In addition, it is possible that uric acid is involved in immune reconstitution as it has been suggested recently that changes in uric acid serum levels can indicate incipient or remaining immunological activity after SCT or induction therapy in patients with hematologic malignancies.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Uric acid levels in adult patients with severe eating disorders [^11a44008]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate serum uric acid (UA) levels in patients with extreme forms of eating disorders, at admission and discharge, following weeks of nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration.

Method

This observational study enrolled 160 patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa restricting subtype (AN-R), AN binge-purge subtype (AN-BP), or avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Serum UA levels were drawn on admission and discharge.

Results

Most of the cohorts were admitted with serum UA levels on the lower end of normal. Mean serum uric level for women was 4.3 mg/dl (SD: 2.3). Patients diagnosed with AN-BP had significantly higher UA levels on admission compared to patients with AN-R and ARFID; p < .0001, η 2 = 0.13. High UA levels positively correlated with purging and admission serum blood urea nitrogen (r = .5, p = .009).

Discussion

Serum UA levels tended to be in the low-normal range in most patients with severe AN-R, but not in AN-BP. However, levels did increase with nutritional intake and weight gain. There may be clinical value in checking UA levels on admission for patients with eating disorders.

### Impact of anti-inflammatory therapies, xanthine oxidase inhibitors and other urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular diseases in gout [^23245ce8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to give an overview of recently published articles covering the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies, xanthine oxidase inhibitors and other urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular diseases in gout.

Recent Findings

In patients with gout, long-term xanthine oxidase inhibition might reduce some cardiovascular comorbidities because of the dual effect of lowering serum uric acid levels and reducing free-radical production during uric acid formation. Among the anti-inflammatory therapies, colchicine has been shown to reduce some major cardiovascular events.

Summary

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that hyperuricaemia and gout are independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms that link high serum uric acid levels and gout with cardiovascular diseases are multifactorial, implicating low-grade systemic inflammation and xanthine oxidase activity as well as the deleterious effect of hyperuricaemia itself.

### Gout and hyperuricemia in young people [^e4c0955d]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout and hyperuricemia have received considerable attention recently, there is limited information on the two conditions in young people. The molecular mechanisms of hyperuricemia have been investigated extensively in recent years, with this knowledge providing new insights and a better understanding of the precocious onset of gout and hyperuricemia.

Recent Findings

Serum uric acid levels are higher in the younger generation compared with the older generation. A proportion of gout and hyperuricemia in childhood is due to inborn errors in purine metabolism. Extensive investigation has demonstrated genetic polymorphisms in the urate transporter associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Whether or not polymorphisms affect the onset of gout and hyperuricemia in young people is unclear. Uric acid levels in childhood have also been shown to correlate with the development of the metabolic syndrome.

Summary

Elevations in serum uric acid levels in childhood are often associated with other diseases and allied conditions. Hyperuricemia in young individuals is often a marker of the metabolic syndrome. Gout is not common in childhood compared with adulthood, and careful consideration of inborn errors of metabolism should be considered in these cases.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^55e9f3b4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Third is the challenge of optimal control of serum urate. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and uricosurics are generic, affordable and the most commonly used drugs; febuxostat, a new ULT, is also available but is more expensive. ULT helps to lower serum urate levels, a central biochemical abnormality in gout. Current guidelines recommend achieving target serum urate of < 6 mg/dl, which is achieved by at most 33% of patients. This is a meaningful disease target since it is associated with improved clinical outcomes such as reduction in gout flares, regression of tophi and lower health care costs (Figure 8). Achievement of this serum urate target frequently requires titration of allopurinol dose, sometimes up to 900 mg/day, rather than a monotonic 300 mg/day dose. Physicians aiming to help gout patients avoid flares and improve function to reap the full benefits of treatment need to monitor serum urate after starting ULT and follow a treat-to-target approach. We believe that it is possible to achieve disease remission in many gout patients with this approach. This is a paradigm shift in gout treatment that is likely to improve patient outcomes. A patient-physician collaborative approach is essential for this to succeed.

We have summarized briefly a few opportunities for improving care and outcomes of gout, for which there are several additional opportunities for interventions not mentioned here. We are at the brink of new treatment options for gout, a better understanding of its impact on cardiovascular and renal disease, and better management with existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches. This is an exciting era in which we know ever more about this ancient disease.

### Prevalence of asymptomatic hyperuricemia and its association with prediabetes, dyslipidemia and subclinical inflammation markers among young healthy adults in Qatar [^9a96aa3b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperuricemia is a pathophysiological condition observed in association with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Hyperuricemia results from the overproduction of uric acid, the end product of purine catabolism. Accumulation of uric acid is due to increased production of uric acid in the body coupled with the paucity of the degradative enzyme, uricase. Humans lack the uricase enzyme, which converts uric acid to a more soluble and excretable product, allantoin. Uric acid is released from the cells in the soluble form; however, after exceeding 404 µmol/L (6.8 mg/dL) concentration in a solution, monosodium urate crystals (MSU) begin to precipitate, especially in the settings of other potentiating factors such as low temperatures and acidic environments. Uric acid has antioxidant properties when present in body fluids at normal physiological levels. However, uric acid has paradoxical effect and appears to be pro-inflammatory at higher concentrations. Uric acid is mostly excreted through the kidneys by tubular secretion and through the intestines (to a lesser extent); however, elevated uric acid is implicated in kidney stone formation.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia, hyperuricemia in individuals who have not experienced gout nor nephrolithiasis, is viewed as a non-pathological condition whilst its prevalence is estimated to range between 10 and 20% worldwide. Until recently, it was thought that uric acid in the soluble form is inert and does not initiate an inflammatory response. Traditionally, the long-established sole consequences of hyperuricemia have been increased susceptibility to gout and renal nephrolithiasis, and thus international evidence-based guidelines recommend hyperuricemia treatment to target gout and nephrolithiasis only. However, Braga et al. have shown that soluble uric acid can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Inflammasome activation in immune cells leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Recent studies demonstrated that soluble uric acid modulates autophagy and inflammasome activation during bacterial infections. Therefore, some have suggested that soluble uric acid is a danger associated molecule (DAMP). However, Mendelian randomization studies, which could detect pertinent evidence of a causal relationship, generally failed to find a causal relationship between serum uric acid levels and chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Effects of lowering glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate on plasma uric acid levels: the omniCarb randomized clinical trial [^4a729114]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of carbohydrates on plasma uric acid levels are a subject of controversy. We determined the individual and combined effects of carbohydrate quality (the glycemic index) and quantity (the proportion of total daily energy [percentage of carbohydrates]) on uric acid levels.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, crossover trial of 4 different diets in overweight or obese adults without cardiovascular disease (n = 163). Participants consumed each of 4 diets over a 5-week period, each of which was separated by a 2-week washout period. Body weight was kept constant. The 4 diets were high glycemic index (≥ 65) with high percentage of carbohydrates (58% kcal), low glycemic index (≤ 45) with low percentage of carbohydrates (40% kcal), low glycemic index with high percentage of carbohydrates, and high glycemic index with low percentage of carbohydrates. Plasma uric acid levels were measured at baseline and after completion of each 5-week period for comparison between the 4 diets.

Results

Of the 163 study participants, 52% were women and 50% were non-Hispanic African American subjects; their mean age was 52.6 years, and their mean ± SD uric acid level was 4.7 ± 1.2 mg/dl. Reducing the glycemic index lowered uric acid levels when the percentage of carbohydrates was low (-0.24 mg/dl; P < 0.001) or high (-0.17 mg/dl; P < 0.001). Reducing the percentage of carbohydrates marginally increased the uric acid level only when the glycemic index was high (P = 0.05). The combined effect of lowering the glycemic index and increasing the percentage of carbohydrates was -0.27 mg/dl (P < 0.001). This effect was observed even after adjustment for concurrent changes in kidney function, insulin sensitivity, and products of glycolysis.

Conclusion

Reducing the glycemic index lowers uric acid levels. Future studies should examine whether reducing the glycemic index can prevent gout onset or flares.

### Molecular basis of the urate transporter URAT1 inhibition by gout drugs [^9940b7c1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a disease that afflicts up to 6.8% of the population globallyand is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, particularly among men in developed countries. Characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis, gout is primarily driven by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals within joints. Hyperuricemia, a major risk factor for gout, is characterized by an accumulation of uric acid in the blood and is increasingly recognized as a potential contributor to a spectrum of comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, renal disorders, kidney failure, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome –. Currently, 21% of Americans are diagnosed with hyperuricemia, and global prevalence is estimated to be up to 36% in different populations. Despite these implications, the management of hyperuricemia and gout remains suboptimal, largely due to limitations in current pharmacological interventions. Unfortunately, the number of gout cases is rapidly surging, with the prevalence of gout increasing globally from 1990 to 2019 by ~21%, and by 90.6% for men in the United States. This not only bears considerable impact on individual quality of life, but also a quickly growing burden for public health. Much-needed improvements in treatments are therefore needed through a better understanding of the causes of gout and the pharmacological targets.

The human urate transporter 1 (URAT1) is encoded by the SLC22A12 gene, which belongs to the SLC22 family of organic cation/anion transporters. URAT1, primarily expressed on the luminal side of the renal proximal tubule, uptakes urate in exchange for exporting monocarboxylates, serving as a specific and major regulator of uric acid reabsorption from the urine (Fig. 1a). Approximately 90% of the urate filtered from the glomeruli is reabsorbed back to the bloodstream, while only 10% is excreted in the urine. Reabsorption of urate is largely mediated by URAT1, making it the critical target for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout –. Case in point, 90% of hypouricemia cases are linked to nonfunctional mutations in URAT1, where the vast majority of mutations are protective against gout and hyperuricemia. Inhibition of URAT1 is therefore an effective strategy to promote uric acid excretion to mitigate the risk of hyperuricemia-related complications, including gout.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^ae8b910e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a prevalent disorder whose frequency is increasing worldwide. In addition to causing excruciating arthritic pain, gout is associated with premature death, classically explained by a high frequency of comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular diseases. Comorbidities must be considered in gout because they could contribute to the vital prognosis of gouty patients and they complicate gout management. These comorbidities are also frequently associated with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, an even more prevalent condition than gout, with their causal relationship with hyperuricaemia raising important therapeutic issues.

### J-shaped curve for the association between serum uric acid levels and the prevalence of blood pressure abnormalities [^ac947d90]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Low and high serum uric acid levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, whether there is a similar association between serum uric acid levels and blood pressure abnormalities has not yet been elucidated. Data from 236,221 individuals (age, 56.0 ± 15.0 years; 107,146 men) who underwent routine health checkups were analyzed. Participants with a serum uric acid level ≤ 2.0mg/dL were separated, and the remaining participants were divided into quartiles according to their serum uric acid levels. Among each group, the proportions of participants with high blood pressure (≥ 130/80mmHg, and/or medication) and hypertension (≥ 140/90mmHg, and/or medication), were calculated. The adjusted odds ratio of each group compared to the group with the lowest proportion of blood pressure abnormalities was calculated. The participants were divided into five groups according to their serum uric acid levels, ≤ 2.0, 2.1–4.0, 4.1–5.0, 5.1–6.0, and ≥ 6.1mg/dL, and the prevalence of high blood pressure was 49.0, 44.6, 52.3, 58.6, and 65.3% and that of hypertension was 31.0, 27.4, 33.5, 38.7, and 43.8%, respectively. Compared to the second-lowest serum uric acid group (2.1–4.0mg/dL), groups with higher serum uric acid levels (4.1–5.0, 5.1–6.0, and ≥ 6.1mg/dL), as well as the group with the lowest serum uric acid level (≤ 2.0mg/dL), showed significantly higher odds ratios for high blood pressure and hypertension. High and low serum uric acid levels were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of high blood pressure and followed a J-shaped curve.

### Association of uric acid levels before start of conditioning with mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-a prospective, non-interventional study of the EBMT transplant complication working party [^18bc95a7]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prospective study identifies uric acid levels, taken before start of conditioning therapy, as a laboratory biomarker to predict mortality after alloSCT.

In animal experiments and in a clinical pilot study the depletion of uric acid with rasburicase led to a reduced frequency of severe GvHD. Therefore, our initial hypothesis was to primarily find an association between uric acid with acute GvHD and then secondarily with NRM. However, we found a strong positive association of uric acid levels with mortality after alloSCT whereas the association between uric acid levels and acute GvHD incidence was not statistically significant. One of the reasons could be the low incidence of GvHD in our cohort due to the patient characteristics of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplant with a high proportion of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) use. The use of in vivo T-cell depletion with ATG in HLA-identical sibling alloSCT in European centres increased recently. This trend is reflected by a higher frequency of ATG use in the present study (41–46%) than we had initially expected. Another likely reason is a hyperinflammatory status connected to high uric acid levels not restricted to acute GvHD with a negative impact on different relevant clinical situations after alloSCT, such as sepsisand adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This view is supported by our observation that death due to both infectious and non-infectious complications after alloSCT was increased in patients with high uric acid levels. Interestingly, an association of uric acid levels with decreased solid organ transplant survival has been described further underlining the significance of uric acid for transplantation biology. Our study extends these findings to the setting of alloSCT.

### Low sensitivity for the metabolic syndrome to detect uric acid elevations in females and non-hispanic-black male adolescents: an analysis of NHANES 1999–2006 [^0c1f0013]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Uric acid is tightly linked to the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and among adults higher uric acid levels are associated with future risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and renal disease.

Objective

Evaluate the sensitivity of MetS to identify adolescents with elevated uric acid levels on a race/ethnicity and gender-specific basis.

Methods

We evaluated 3296 male and female adolescents 12–19 y participating in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey 1999–06, comprised of 67.6% non-Hispanic whites, 15.1% non-Hispanic blacks, and 17.3% Hispanics. We used a definition of MetS modified for use in adolescents and evaluated the sensitivity of a diagnosis of MetS to identify individuals with uric acid elevations (approximately the 95th percentile of uric acid by gender among normal-weight adolescents).

Results

When used as a screening test to identify individuals with uric acid elevations MetS performed more poorly among females (18.0%) than among males (37.0%) (p < 0.001). Among males, MetS exhibited a lower sensitivity among non-Hispanic blacks (17.8%) compared to Hispanics (45.9%) (p < 0.01) and non-Hispanic whites (37.4%) (p < 0.05). There were no race/ethnicity differences in detecting elevated uric acid levels among females (non-Hispanic-white 15.5%, non-Hispanic-black 19.4%, Hispanic 26.5%, p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Current criteria to diagnose MetS exhibit racial/ethnic and gender differences in the ability to identify adolescents with elevated uric acid levels, performing poorly among non-Hispanic-black males and among females. Given emerging data regarding the ability of uric acid elevations for predicting future disease, these data may have implications regarding the use of MetS as a marker of risk among all gender and racial/ethnic groups.

Risks of (A) all‐cause and (B) cardiovascular disease mortality by malnourishment status among participants with low serum uric acid (< 4 mg/dL). Participants with a serum uric acid level of 4 to < 5 mg/dL served as the reference group.

Subgroup Analyses

The effect‐modifying role of malnourishment in low SUA‐associated higher mortality was examined in different subgroups of sex, age, eGFR, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The inverse associations between low SUA levels with all‐cause and CVD mortalities were consistent across all subgroups of the malnourished participants (Figure 4).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1d7dc0d0]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 3.14.1 — hyperuricemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD): We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid–lowering intervention (1C). The Work Group placed high value on avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of acute gout and preventing long-term complications of recurrent gout among people with CKD, and noted there are well-tolerated and low-cost oral medications that reduce uric acid concentration in people with CKD.

### Uricosuric drugs: the once and future therapy for hyperuricemia? [^76db9c44]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although uricosuric agents provide the most time-honoured approach to the control of hyperuricemia, their place in the armamentarium has been eclipsed by that of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. This review considers the potential for uricosuric agents from the perspective of recent progress in the understanding of urate transport systems.

Recent Findings

No new agents have yet become available, but promising new drugs are under development. Better understanding of the transporters URAT1 and ABCG2 in particular would appear to provide opportunities for more selective, better tolerated agents to increase the renal clearance of uric acid and thereby control hyperuricemia.

Summary

Conceptually, modest inhibition of renal tubular reabsorption should provide effective relief for the millions of individuals who are now hyperuricemic and who suffer from its principal consequence, gout.

Hyperuricemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid–lowering intervention (1C). Consider initiating uric acid–lowering therapy for people with CKD after their first episode of gout particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is > 9 mg/dl [535 μmol/l]. Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia. For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D).

### Update in uric acid, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases [^fdb5c44f]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A direct relationship between serum uric acid levels and hypertension, cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases has been reported in many basic and epidemiological studies. Among these, high blood pression is one of the most common features associated with hyperuricemia. In this regard, several small-scale interventional studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive or prehypertensive patients on uric acid-lowering drugs. These observation or intervention studies have led to affirm that there is a causal relationship between uric acid and hypertension. While the clinical association between uric acid and high blood pressure is notable, no clear conclusion has yet been reached as to whether lowering uric acid is beneficial to prevent cardiovascular and renal metabolic diseases. Recently, several prospective randomized controlled intervention trials using allopurinol and other uric acid-lowering drugs have been reported, and the results from these trials were almost negative, suggesting that the correlation between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease has no causality. However, it is important to note that in some of these recent studies there were high dropout rates and an important fraction of participants were not hyperuricemic. Therefore, we should carry caution in interpreting the results of these studies. This review article presents the results of recent clinical trials using uric acid-lowering drugs, focusing on hypertension and cardiovascular and renal metabolic diseases, and discusses the future of uric acid therapy.
