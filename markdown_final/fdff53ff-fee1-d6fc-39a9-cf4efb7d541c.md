## Question

High dose atorvaststin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about high-dose atorvastatin, including its definition, efficacy, safety, guideline-supported indications, special populations, and practical prescribing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "high-dose" is defined in contemporary guidelines. Then, I should verify the magnitude of LDL-C lowering and whether there is a dose-response ceiling. Next, I will review outcome data in secondary prevention, acute coronary syndromes, and special populations. After that, I need to examine safety signals, including liver enzymes, myopathy, and rare events. Finally, I will align indications with guidelines and outline monitoring, titration, and alternatives if high-dose therapy is not tolerated, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "high-dose" atorvastatin. Contemporary guidelines categorize high-intensity statin therapy as atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily, which is expected to lower LDL-C by at least 50% on average, whereas moderate-intensity corresponds to 10–20 mg daily with 30–49% LDL-C reduction, and low-intensity to less than 30% reduction, so high-dose atorvastatin in this context means 40–80 mg daily [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^d4ed0ce5] [^03f70667].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response and whether 80 mg adds meaningful LDL-C lowering beyond 40 mg. Cochrane analyses show a linear log-dose relationship for LDL-C reduction across 10–80 mg, with LDL-C decreasing by roughly 37–52% over that range, and doubling the dose yields about a 6% additional LDL-C reduction, which supports the concept that 80 mg achieves greater absolute lowering than 40 mg, albeit with diminishing returns per milligram increase [^4425dee1] [^01f6bb08] [^e93acd3f]. I should also note that rosuvastatin is more potent milligram-for-milligram, so 20–40 mg rosuvastatin achieves comparable or greater LDL-C reductions than atorvastatin 40–80 mg, which matters when choosing between high-intensity agents [^ee9cc814] [^d03a5345].

> Next, I should review outcome data in secondary prevention. The IDEAL trial in post-MI patients showed that atorvastatin 80 mg reduced nonfatal MI and major cardiovascular events versus simvastatin 20–40 mg, though the primary composite of major coronary events did not reach statistical significance, and there were more transaminase elevations with 80 mg, which tempers enthusiasm but still supports event reduction in high-risk patients [^afa873a5]. The TNT trial in stable CHD demonstrated a 22% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin 80 mg versus 10 mg, with achieved LDL-C of 77 mg/dL versus 101 mg/dL, reinforcing the benefit of more intensive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk patients [^1b5a9226]. Let me also consider PROVE IT-TIMI 22 in ACS, where atorvastatin 80 mg outperformed pravastatin 40 mg with a 16% reduction in the composite endpoint and lower achieved LDL-C, supporting early, intensive therapy after ACS [^d709a5b3].

> Hold on, I should verify benefits in older adults and special populations. In TNT, patients aged 65 and older experienced a 19% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events with high-dose atorvastatin versus low-dose, without excess persistent CK elevations, supporting intensification even in older secondary prevention patients when tolerated [^1b5a9226]. In diabetes, high-dose atorvastatin achieves greater non-HDL-C goal attainment and modifies atherogenic lipoproteins more than low-dose, aligning with broader evidence that aggressive LDL-C lowering reduces events in diabetes, including older adults [^2881545b] [^30709c22]. For ACS patients undergoing PCI, short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment reduces 30-day MACE and improves TIMI flow, suggesting early pleiotropic and plaque-stabilizing effects in the peri-procedural window [^b552d77d].

> I need to check safety carefully. High-dose atorvastatin is generally well tolerated, but liver enzyme elevations are more frequent: persistent ALT > 3× ULN occurred in about 0.6% with 80 mg versus 0.1% with 10 mg in pooled analyses, and serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis remain rare, with no excess signal for rhabdomyolysis versus lower doses in long-term trials, though vigilance is warranted, especially with interacting drugs or comorbidities [^016d6401] [^138bad97] [^e1ab14a5]. Muscle symptoms occur in roughly 1–3% in trials, but observational cohorts suggest higher rates in practice, so I should counsel patients and reassess if symptoms emerge, keeping in mind that many cases are mild and manageable with dose adjustment or switching agents [^016d6401] [^798805e9]. I should also remember that high-dose simvastatin carries a markedly higher myopathy risk, which is why simvastatin 80 mg is not recommended, whereas atorvastatin 80 mg remains acceptable when indicated and monitored [^1e9724fd] [^69a6f147].

> But wait, what about intracranial hemorrhage risk at very low LDL-C with high-dose statins. A VA/DoD synthesis notes uncertainty, with one meta-analysis suggesting a possible increase and a larger, more comprehensive analysis showing no significant increase in ICH with high-dose statins, so I should individualize risk, especially in patients with cerebrovascular disease or prior hemorrhagic stroke, and avoid overly aggressive targets in those with high bleeding risk [^3aa334bf]. I should double-check that this does not negate the clear secondary prevention benefit of high-intensity statins in ischemic stroke, where SPARCL showed reduced recurrent stroke with atorvastatin 80 mg, albeit with a small increase in hemorrhagic stroke in a subset, reinforcing the need to balance risk and etiology [^30709c22].

> Next, I should review guideline-supported indications. High-intensity atorvastatin is recommended for secondary prevention in clinical ASCVD, for primary prevention in adults with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, for adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes, and for those with elevated 10-year ASCVD risk using the pooled cohort equations, with the caveat that shared decision-making is essential in older adults and those with borderline or intermediate risk [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34]. For adults older than 75 years, guidelines support continuation of high-intensity statins for secondary prevention if tolerated, and allow moderate-intensity therapy for primary prevention when risk is elevated, emphasizing function, frailty, and patient preferences [^a02c1e1a] [^b9786881]. I should confirm that diabetes standards endorse high-intensity statins in diabetes unless contraindicated, which they do, including in older adults when appropriate [^6f59290d] [^30709c22].

> I will now examine practical prescribing and monitoring. Let me first confirm that atorvastatin 40–80 mg can be initiated based on risk category, with 40 mg reasonable when a gentler high-intensity start is preferred and 80 mg when rapid, maximal LDL-C lowering is prioritized, such as after ACS or in very high-risk patients, with reassessment of LDL-C at 4–12 weeks to gauge response and adherence [^1e9724fd] [^798805e9]. I should check liver enzymes at baseline and if symptoms arise, and consider checking a CK if muscle symptoms are reported, recognizing that routine CK monitoring is not required in asymptomatic patients, and I should review drug interactions, especially CYP3A4 inhibitors, before choosing 80 mg [^e1ab14a5] [^1e9724fd]. If high-dose therapy is not tolerated, I should switch to an alternative high-intensity agent such as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, or use moderate-intensity therapy with or without ezetimibe, which still yields meaningful risk reduction when high-intensity is not feasible [^1e9724fd] [^4f5a4df4].

> Hold on, I should verify a few nuances. Some Asian datasets suggest higher rates of adverse effects at 80 mg, prompting some trials to cap at 40 mg in certain populations, so I should individualize and consider starting at 40 mg with uptitration if needed and tolerated, balancing efficacy and safety in shared decision-making [^70b51a29]. Also, while pleiotropic effects like CRP lowering and ROCK inhibition are intriguing, the magnitude of clinical benefit tracks closely with LDL-C reduction, so I should not over-attribute non-lipid effects when counseling patients about expected outcomes [^ce39335a] [^f807e7e2].

> In summary, high-dose atorvastatin at 40–80 mg daily is a guideline-endorsed, evidence-based strategy for high and very high-risk patients, achieving greater LDL-C lowering and reducing cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, ACS, diabetes, and selected older adults, with a safety profile that is acceptable when patients are appropriately selected and monitored, and with alternatives available when intolerance or interactions arise [^1e9724fd] [^afa873a5] [^1b5a9226] [^30709c22] [^016d6401].

---

High-dose atorvastatin (40–80 mg/day) is indicated for **high-intensity LDL-C lowering** in patients with clinical ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with elevated ASCVD risk, and is first-line after ACS to reduce recurrent events [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^6f59290d]. It lowers LDL-C by about **50–60%** and reduces cardiovascular events, but increases the risk of liver enzyme elevations and muscle symptoms; routine monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended, and patients should be counseled on muscle symptoms and drug interactions [^4425dee1] [^afa873a5] [^e1ab14a5]. Use the lowest effective dose, consider drug interactions, and adjust therapy if intolerance occurs [^b750cd86].

---

## Clinical indications and guidelines

High-dose atorvastatin is **recommended** for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Clinical ASCVD**: Secondary prevention in patients with established ASCVD (e.g. coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease) [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34].

- **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: Primary prevention in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34].

- **Diabetes with elevated ASCVD risk**: Primary prevention in patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes and elevated ASCVD risk [^1e9724fd] [^6f59290d].

- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended immediately after ACS to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events [^1e9724fd] [^d709a5b3].

---

## Efficacy in lipid lowering and cardiovascular outcomes

High-dose atorvastatin produces **significant reductions** in LDL-C and cardiovascular events:

| **Study** | **LDL-C reduction** | **Cardiovascular outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| IDEAL (atorvastatin 80 mg vs simvastatin 20–40 mg) | LDL-C: 81 mg/dL vs 104 mg/dL | - 13% reduction in major coronary events <br/> - 16% reduction in nonfatal MI [^afa873a5] |
| TNT (atorvastatin 80 mg vs 10 mg) | LDL-C: 77 mg/dL vs 101 mg/dL | - 22% reduction in major cardiovascular events <br/> - 22% reduction in stroke [^notfound] |
| PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (atorvastatin 80 mg vs pravastatin 40 mg) | LDL-C: 62 mg/dL vs 95 mg/dL | - 16% reduction in death, MI, UA requiring rehospitalization, revascularization, or stroke [^d709a5b3] |

---

These studies demonstrate that high-dose atorvastatin achieves greater LDL-C lowering and **reduces cardiovascular events** compared with moderate-intensity regimens.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

High-dose atorvastatin is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should be aware of the following **adverse effects**:

- **Hepatic effects**: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) occur in approximately 0.5–2% of patients, typically within the first 3 months of therapy. Persistent elevations > 3× ULN occur in about 0.6% of patients on atorvastatin 80 mg [^016d6401] [^e1ab14a5].

- **Muscle-related effects**: Myalgia occurs in about 1–3% of patients, while rhabdomyolysis is rare (< 0.1%) but can be severe. Risk increases with concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors, renal impairment, or hypothyroidism [^016d6401] [^e1ab14a5].

- **Other effects**: Rare reports of cognitive impairment, hyperglycemia, and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy have been described [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management of adverse effects

Regular monitoring and patient counseling are **essential** to minimize adverse effects:

- **Liver enzymes**: Baseline and periodic ALT/AST monitoring is recommended, especially during dose escalation or when clinically indicated [^notfound].

- **Muscle symptoms**: Patients should be instructed to report unexplained muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine promptly. CK measurement is recommended if symptoms suggest myopathy [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Clinicians should review concomitant medications for potential interactions, particularly CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, macrolides, HIV protease inhibitors) that increase atorvastatin levels and myopathy risk [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other statins

High-dose atorvastatin is **more potent** than moderate-dose simvastatin or pravastatin, achieving greater LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, rosuvastatin 20–40 mg achieves comparable or greater LDL-C lowering with a similar safety profile, and the choice between high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should be individualized based on patient characteristics and tolerability [^ee9cc814] [^ce949a39].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly patients**: High-dose atorvastatin is effective and generally safe in older adults, but clinicians should monitor closely for adverse effects and consider dose adjustments if intolerance occurs [^1b5a9226] [^a02c1e1a].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Atorvastatin does not require dose adjustment in CKD, but clinicians should remain vigilant for muscle-related adverse effects [^55d36511].

- **Patients with liver disease**: Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in liver enzymes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy**, balancing efficacy and safety:

- **High-intensity statins**: Recommended for clinical ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and diabetes with elevated ASCVD risk, unless contraindicated or not tolerated [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of adherence, lipid levels, liver enzymes, and clinical symptoms is recommended [^notfound].

- **Alternative therapy**: If high-dose atorvastatin is not tolerated, consider moderate-intensity statins or alternative lipid-lowering therapies (e.g. ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) [^b750cd86] [^4f5a4df4].

---

High-dose atorvastatin (40–80 mg/day) is effective for **high-intensity LDL-C lowering** and reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but requires monitoring for liver enzyme elevations and muscle symptoms. Clinicians should individualize therapy, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust treatment as needed to balance efficacy and safety.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^4425dee1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

### High-dose atorvastatin is superior to moderate-dose simvastatin in preventing peripheral arterial disease [^ecc9c28a]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study whether high-dose versus usual-dose statin treatment reduces the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and what is the effect of high-dose statin treatment on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome in patients with PAD.

Methods and Results

In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial, 8888 post-myocardial infarction patients were randomised to high-dose or usual-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 80mg/day vs simvastatin 20-40mg/day). We investigated the effect of high-dose versus usual-dose statins on the pre-specified outcome PAD incidence, and additionally performed a posthoc analysis of the efficacy of high-dose statins in reducing CVD risk among patients with PAD. During a median follow-up of 4.8years, 94 patients (2.2%) receiving atorvastatin and 135 patients (3.2%) receiving simvastatin developed PAD (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91; p = 0.007). The risk of major coronary events was almost twofold higher in patients with PAD at baseline, but was no longer significant after adjusting for the adverse cardiovascular risk profile. In PAD patients, major coronary events occurred in fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (14.4%) than in the simvastatin group (20.1%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.11; p = 0.13). Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced overall cardiovascular (p = 0.046) and coronary events (p = 0.004), and coronary revascularisation (p = 0.007) in these patients.

Conclusions

High-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of PAD compared with usual-dose statin therapy with simvastatin. Patients with a history of PAD at baseline were at higher risk of future coronary events and this risk was reduced by high-dose atorvastatin treatment.

### Lipid lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^01f6bb08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood lipids and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to November 2011), ISI Web of Science (1899 to November 2011) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to November 2011). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of 3 to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. WDAE information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

Two hundred fifty-four trials evaluated the dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 33,505 participants. Log dose-response data revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides. Combining all the trials using the generic inverse variance fixed-effect model for doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in decreases of 36% to 53% for LDL-cholesterol. There was no significant dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. WDAE were not statistically different between atorvastatin and placebo for these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.45).

Authors' Conclusions

Blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effect of atorvastatin was dependent on dose. Log dose-response data was linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Manufacturer-recommended atorvastatin doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in 36% to 53% decreases of LDL-cholesterol. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 37% of the placebo-controlled trials.

### Safety of high-dose atorvastatin therapy [^138bad97]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the safety of statins, with emphasis on high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg), the agent with the most efficacy data for clinical outcomes. Although elevated levels of hepatic enzymes were of concern when statins were first introduced, a review of data from large clinical trials shows that elevations in hepatic enzymes are rare and do not lead to clinically significant liver disease. Despite the withdrawal of cerivastatin because of fatal rhabdomyolysis, the risk of this complication with other statins is extremely low. Mild and often transient myalgia is more commonly reported. The safety of high-dose atorvastatin has been evaluated in > 11,000 patients, and rates of clinically significant myopathy and elevated hepatic enzymes were extremely low. Simvastatin at doses up to 40 mg is also associated with low rates of elevated hepatic enzymes and myopathy. However, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin carries a risk of myopathy (muscle symptoms and creatine kinase levels > 10,000 U/L) of approximately 1 in 250. The clinical benefits of preventing vascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, and need for revascularization outweigh the low rates of adverse events associated with high-dose statin therapy in high- and intermediate-risk patients.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^afa873a5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; P = 0.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; P = 0.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; P < .001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73–1.15; P = 0.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85–1.13; P = 0.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P < .001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^ee9cc814]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### A dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomized controlled trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin [^a6184d3c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The available statins exhibit differences in the potency with which they alter serum lipid levels.

Objective

Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the relative potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the 2 most commonly prescribed statins) across all possible dose combinations in terms of changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for randomized, head-to-head trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients aged ≥ 18 years with elevated levels of serum TC and LDL-C. Reference lists of the identified articles, letters, and editorials also were reviewed. The manufacturers of atorvastatin and simvastatin products were contacted for relevant unpublished data. All studies were reviewed and rated for quality by 2 independent reviewers. The maximum quality score was 4 points; trials with a score of < 2 points were considered to be of poor quality and were excluded from analysis. Dose comparisons were abstracted in pairs from each trial. Meta-analyses were conducted on the fixed-dose pairs for each lipid parameter. Weighted mean differences in the change in TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C were estimated using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model.

Results

Seventeen published trials and 1 unpublished study were included in the meta-analyses. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in TC, LDL-C, and TG in the majority of dose comparisons with simvastatin. The potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin was comparable at dose ratios between 1:2 and 1:4. Higher doses of simvastatin were more effective in increasing HDL-C levels than atorvastatin, with no apparent dose-equivalence point. The HDL-C advantage of simvastatin was greatest when simvastatin 80 mg was compared with atorvastatin 80 mg (weighted mean difference, -4.35%; 95% CI, -5.64 to -3.08, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In these meta-analyses, atorvastatin was 2 to 4 times as potent as simvastatin in reducing TC, LDL-C, and TG, indicating that the dose equivalence of atorvastatin and simvastatin lay between 1:2 and 1:4. In contrast, simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in increasing HDL-C, but without any indication of a point of dose equivalence.

### Efficacy of high-intensity atorvastatin for Asian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^305c1660]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Statins have proven cardioprotective effects, but higher doses are accompanied by various concerns and may not lead to superior clinical outcomes in Chinese/Asian populations.

Objective

We designed a trial to test the efficacy of high-intensity statin therapy for the reduction of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) and 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs, including cardiovascular death, spontaneous MI, unplanned revascularization) in an Asian population.

Methods

A total of 798 Chinese patients with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomized to high-intensity atorvastatin (80 mg/d before percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and 40 mg/d thereafter for 1 year, n = 400) or moderate-intensity atorvastatin (20 mg/d for 1 year, n = 398). The primary end point was 1-year incidence of MACEs.

Result

In patients with stable angina, 1-year MACE rates were not significantly different between moderate- and high-intensity groups (7.6% vs 5.7%, P = 0.53). In contrast, in patients with ACS, the 1-year MACE rate was significantly higher in the moderate- than in the high-intensity atorvastatin group (16.8% vs 10.1%, P = 0.021; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.77, P = 0.021).

Conclusions

Whereas stable angina patients derive similar benefit from moderate- and high-intensity atorvastatin therapy over the duration of 1 year after PCI, high-intensity statin therapy is superior in ACS patients.

### Outcomes of using high-or low-dose atorvastatin in patients 65 years of age or older with stable coronary heart disease [^1b5a9226]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Increased life expectancy is associated with an increase in the burden of chronic cardiovascular disease.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose atorvastatin in patients 65 years of age or older.

Design

A prespecified secondary analysis of the Treating to New Targets study, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

Setting

256 sites in 14 countries participating in the Treating to New Targets study.

Participants

10,001 patients (3809 patients ≥ 65 years of age) with coronary heart disease (CHD) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 3.4 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL).

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin, 10 or 80 mg/d.

Measurements

The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event (death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke).

Results

In patients 65 years of age or older, absolute risk was reduced by 2.3% and relative risk by 19% for major cardiovascular events in favor of the high-dose atorvastatin group (hazard ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.98]; P = 0.032). Among the components of the composite outcome, the mortality rates from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal stroke (ischemic, embolic, hemorrhagic, or unknown origin) were all lower in older patients who received high-dose atorvastatin, although the difference was not statistically significant for each individual component. The improved clinical outcome in patients 65 years of age or older was not associated with persistent elevations in creatine kinase levels.

Limitation

Because the study was a secondary analysis, the findings should be interpreted within the context of the main study results.

Conclusions

The analysis suggests that additional clinical benefit can be achieved by treating older patients with CHD more aggressively to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to less than 2.6 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The findings support the use of intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk older persons with established cardiovascular disease.

### Efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials [^b552d77d]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unclear. This meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

Hypothesis

Short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment may be beneficial in reducing major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and improving myocardial blood flow in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically reviewed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to March 2013, in which short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment was compared with control for patients with ACS undergoing PCI. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of MACEs at 30 days. The meta-analysis was performed with the fixed effect model or random-effects model according to the heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.0 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Results

Nine RCTs incorporating 952 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment significantly reduced the incidence of MACEs at 30-day follow-up (risk ratio [RR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.25 to 0.61, P < 0.001) and improved the final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade (RR 1.08, 95% Cl: 1.02 to 1.14, P = 0.01) compared with controls. There were no significant differences in peak creatine kinase-myocardial band and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level post-PCI between the 2 groups, though there were favorable trends related to statin use. As to the safety end points, no significant difference was observed in elevated liver aminotransferase level between short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment and control groups (RR 1.36, 95% Cl: 0.67 to 2.74).

Conclusions

The use of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment is safe and significantly improves the final TIMI flow grade as well as reduces the 30-day MACEs in ACS patients post-PCI. This finding encourages the use of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment as an alternative for ACS patients undergoing PCI, but more high-quality randomized clinical trials are still needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety.

### Impact of high-dose atorvastatin in coronary heart disease patients age 65 to 78 years [^94d52f5b]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

High-dose statin therapy may be underutilized in aged patients due to doubts about efficacy and safety.

Hypothesis

To investigate outcomes and safety in patients aged 65–78 years compared with patients aged < 65 years in the ALLIANCE study.

Methods

A total of 2,442 stable coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with dyslipidemia were randomized to either aggressive treatment (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol titration goal of < 80 mg/dL or maximum 80 mg/d of atorvastatin) or usual care (continuation of baseline lipid-lowering therapy, with changes and laboratory analyses directed by treating physicians).

Results

A total of 1,001 patients aged 65–78 years were followed for a median period of 53.9 mo. Older, aggressively treated atorvastatin patients experienced a 27% relative risk reduction for the primary composite endpoint of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.73; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.57–0.94; p = 0.016). In addition, significant risk reductions were observed for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI; HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23–0.79; p = 0.006), cardiac revascularization (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48–0.93; p = 0.017), and the combined endpoint of cardiac death and nonfatal MI (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.32–0.72; p = 0.001). The rate of significant liver transaminase elevations in atorvastatin patients was low and not age related. There were no cases of rhabdomyolysis. The rate of study discontinuations due to serious adverse events was higher in patients aged 65–78 years than in those younger than 65 years, but was similar between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Our data support the efficacy and safety of aggressive lipid management with atorvastatin in older CHD patients.

### A review of high-dose statin therapy: targeting cholesterol and inflammation in atherosclerosis [^19515221]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Lipid lowering with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or 'statins' has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with established cardiovascular disease. Recently, there have been multiple studies investigating the role of high-dose statin therapy with more aggressive lipid lowering in this setting. Concomitantly, there is increasing evidence implicating a role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These high-dose statin trials and other studies have also provided a wealth of data suggesting that statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties that go beyond their lipid-lowering effects. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of recent, large-scale, randomized, placebo and active controlled trials of high-dose statin therapy in the setting of stable and unstable coronary artery disease and percutaneous coronary intervention. Further, we will discuss the evidence for effects of high-dose statin therapy on inflammation and C-reactive protein.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^d709a5b3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

SECONDARY PREVENTION: HOW LOW SHOULD WE GO?

In patients with overt CVD, the guidelines state an optional goal LDL of 70 mg%. This recommendation is based on several recently published trials that examined the effect of aggressive LDL lowering therapy (i.e. high dose statin therapy) in high risk populations of patients (Table 3). In the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients 10 days after an acute coronary syndrome (acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], or high-risk unstable angina) were randomized to standard 40 mg pravastatin treatment or high dose/aggressive 80 mg atorvastatin treatment. Patients were followed for 18 to 36 months and achieved an average LDL cholesterol level of 62 mg% in the atorvastatin group and 95 mg% in the pravastatin group. In the aggressive therapy group versus the control group, a significant 16% reduction in the primary end point (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring re-hospitalization, revascularization and stroke) was noted. 18% of the ∼1,600 patients in each treatment arm suffered from diabetes and showed similar risk reduction to that of the general cohort. A post hoc analysis of the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial data revealed a reduction not only in LDL cholesterol but also in CRP levels. This reduction in CRP was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events irrespective of the associated LDL reduction.

High-dose statin secondary prevention trials

ADA standards of clinical care recommendations versus evidence-based suggestion for revised recommendations

Another important trial was the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. In one arm of this study, a total of 1,501 patients with diabetes, stable coronary heart disease, and LDL levels < 130 mg% were randomized to receive low-dose (10 mg) or high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin and followed for 4.9 years. At the end of the study, LDL levels in the low-dose group were 98 versus 77 mg% in the high-dose group. This was associated with a significant 25% reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events (defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non–procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke) in the high-dose versus the low-dose group.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^bc77fbc2]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### Effect of high-dose atorvastatin on the cardiovascular risk associated with individual components of metabolic syndrome: a subanalysis of the treating to new targets (TNT) study [^992b06af]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the impact of intensive lipid-lowering with high-dose atorvastatin on the cardiovascular risk associated with individual metabolic syndrome components [high body mass index (BMI), elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension and elevated fasting glucose] in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

Patients with clinically evident, stable CHD and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol < 3.4mmol/l (130mg/dl) were randomized to double-blind therapy with atorvastatin 10mg/day (n = 5006) or 80mg/day (n = 4995) after an 8-week open-label run-in with atorvastatin 10mg. The median follow-up was 4.9years. The impact of individual metabolic syndrome risk factors was tested on the primary endpoint, which was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event.

Results

On-treatment LDL cholesterol was 2.6mmol/l (101mg/dl) with atorvastatin 10mg and 2.0mmol/l (77mg/dl) with atorvastatin 80mg. Among patients receiving atorvastatin 10mg, the presence of each individual metabolic syndrome component significantly increased the risk of major cardiovascular events compared with the absence of each (BMI, p = 0.014; triglycerides, p = 0.006; HDL cholesterol, p = 0.0006; hypertension, p < 0.0001; and fasting glucose p < 0.0001). In patients receiving atorvastatin 80mg, elevated triglycerides and fasting glucose were no longer significant predictors of major cardiovascular events. The predictive power of hypertension on the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced in patients treated with atorvastatin 80mg, although it remained a significant predictor.

Conclusions

Treatment with high-dose atorvastatin to a mean LDL cholesterol level of 2.0mmol/l (77mg/dl) considerably attenuated the predictive power associated with three metabolic syndrome components.

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: the achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^af4c1c9d]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target (< 2.6 mmol/L) LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) values would allow high-risk subjects to achieve target LDL-C concentration within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or a single uptitration.

Methods and Results

Twelve-week, prospective, open-label trial that enrolled 2117 high-risk subjects (statin-free [SF] or statin-treated [ST]). Subjects with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL) but ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/day) based on LDL-C and status of statin use at baseline, with a single uptitration at 6 weeks, if required. There was no washout for ST subjects. At study end, 80% of SF (82%, 82%, 83% and 72% with 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of ST (60%, 61% and 51% with 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) subjects reached LDL-C target. In the ST group, an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C was observed over the statin used at baseline. Atorvastatin was well tolerated.

Conclusion

This study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values (i.e. the required LDL-C reduction), allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to achieve target safely, within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or with a single titration.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^d001222e]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Effects of low doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^7861c8d6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Simvastatin 40 to 80 mg/d has been found to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels significantly more than atorvastatin at equipotent doses (ie, 20–80 mg/d). Data on the effects of lower doses of the 2 drugs on HDL-C levels are conflicting.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin 20 mg/d and atorvastatin 10 mg/d on HDL-C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

Patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol [TC] > 250 mg/dL) who were not taking any lipid-lowering agents and who were following a low-fat diet were randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments: simvastatin 20 mg/d or atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Serum TC, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL-C levels were measured using standard methods after 2 months of therapy. In a secondary analysis, lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol were measured after 1 year in patients who continued treatment.

Results

Of the 240 patients enrolled (108 men and 132 women; age range, 23–77 years, mean [SEM] 56.7 [0.69]), 235 completed the study. After 2 months of therapy, TC, LDL-C, and serum TG levels decreased significantly versus baseline in both groups (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between treatment groups. HDL-C levels increased by 9.0% (P < 0.001 vs baseline) in the simvastatin group and by 4.3% (P < 0.02) in the atorvastatin group. The difference between the 2 groups in the percentage increase in HDL-C was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In 113 patients who continued treatment, HDL-C levels at 1 year were still significantly higher than baseline levels in the simvastatin group (6.3%, P = 0.034), but not in the atorvastatin group (2.8%, P = 0.587).

Conclusions

The findings from this study suggest that the HDL-C-increasing effect of simvastatin 20 mg is significantly greater than that of atorvastatin 10 mg. Since increasing HDL-C levels is thought to lower the risk for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, these results warrant further investigation.

### Cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin compared with regular dose simvastatin [^566aa753]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of high-dose atorvastatin when compared with generic simvastatin for secondary prevention in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden based on the recently completed IDEAL trial.

Methods and Results

The IDEAL trial showed that high-dose treatment with atorvastatin was associated with fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MI) or coronary heart disease death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78–1.01) and major cardiovascular events by (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.98) or any coronary event (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.76–0.91) than simvastatin with no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events. Costs during the trial period was estimated based on the trial data and a Markov model was constructed where the risk of MIs and revascularization procedures and the long-term costs, quality of life, and mortality associated with these events was simulated. Costs were based on resource consumptions recorded in the trial multiplied with recent unit costs from each country. Both direct health care costs and indirect costs (costs from lost production due to work absence) were included. Intervention lasted for the duration of the trial (4.8 years) while health-effects and costs are predicted for the lifespan of the patient. The main outcome was quality adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. High-dose treatment was predicted to lead to a mean increase in survival of 0.049 years per patient and 0.033 QALYs gained. The cost to gain one QALY was predicted to 47,197euro (Denmark), 62,639euro (Finland), 35,210euro (Norway), and 43,667euro (Sweden), with cost-effectiveness ratio decreasing with higher risk.

Conclusion

In the prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with a previous MI, high-dose atorvastatin appears to be a cost-effective strategy when compared with generic simvastatin 20–40 mg in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. In Finland, it is cost-effective in high-risk patients. The key driver of the cost-effectiveness is the price-difference between 80 mg atorvastatin and generic simvastatin.

### Comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 lipid-lowering agents: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^d03a5345]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing the dose-response of a new drug to that of a previously studied drug can aid in understanding their relative potencies. Two dose-finding studies addressed the effect of a new drug, rosuvastatin, on its ability to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. One of these studies included 2 doses of atorvastatin, and substantial additional information is available in the literature about the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C level lowering.

Methods

The 2 dose-finding studies of rosuvastatin considered otherwise healthy patients who had hypercholesterolemia. Comparable studies of atorvastatin were identified via a MEDLINE search in December 1999. Multiple reviewer consensus identified 15 of 41 studies on atorvastatin published since 1996 that met these selection criteria: reporting of LDL-C level change from baseline at least 6 weeks after treatment initiation, doses administered, and treatment group sizes. Eligible populations had clinical evidence of hypercholesterolemia. We excluded studies with patients who had severe illness or a previous history of transplantation. Data extraction of the mean, sample sizes, and SDs (or CIs) by dose was carried out independently by multiple reviewers. We combined the results from the various studies with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and analyzed them with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

Results

Combining this study and literature results substantially increased the power to compare the dose-response relationships of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C level by an estimated 10 to 17 percentage points more than atorvastatin when both were given at the same dose. Approximately one quarter of the dose of rosuvastatin achieved about the same magnitude of LDL-C level reduction as atorvastatin at dosages as high as 80 mg. This finding does not imply a 4-fold difference in efficacy overall and specifically does not describe the results at higher dosage levels.

Conclusions

Bayesian meta-analysis of results from related studies allows the comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 drugs, better estimates of a particular dose-response relationship within an individual study, and the expression of relative benefits (of dose and drug) in terms of probabilities. Explicitly comparing a study's results with historical data using Bayesian meta-analysis allows clinicians to view the study in the larger context of medical research.

### Differential effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I are consistent across hypercholesterolemic patient subgroups [^0b72ca7a]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In addition to lowering plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), statins also raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Hypothesis

Recent studies have shown that treatment with simvastatin results in larger increases in HDL-C than those seen with atorvastatin. The results of three clinical studies are analyzed, comparing the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) in the total cohort and in several subgroups of hypercholesterolemic patients. The three studies were all multicenter, randomized clinical trials that included simvastatin (20–80 mg) and atorvastatin (10–80 mg) treatment arms. The subgroup analyses performed were gender; age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years); baseline HDL-C (male: < 40 or ≥ 40 mg/dl; female: < 45 or ≥ 45 mg/dl), baseline LDL-C (< 160 or ≥ 160 mg/dl), and baseline triglycerides (< 200 or ≥ 200 mg/dl).

Results

Both drugs produced similar increases in HDL-C levels at low doses; however, at higher drug doses (40 and 80 mg), HDL-C showed a significantly greater increase with simvastatin than with atorvastatin (p < 0.05 to < 0.001). Therefore, while HDL-C remained consistently elevated across all doses of simvastatin, there appeared to be a pattern of decreasing HDL-C with an increasing dose of atorvastatin. A similar negative dose response pattern was also observed with apo A-I in atorvastatin-treated patients, suggesting a reduction in the number of circulating HDL particles at higher doses. Both drugs reduced LDL-C and triglycerides in a dose-dependent fashion, with atorvastatin showing slightly greater effects. The differential effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on HDL-C and apo A-I were observed for both the whole study cohorts and all subgroups examined; thus, no consistent treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed.

Conclusion

The data presented show that, across different hypercholesterolemic patient subgroups, simvastatin increases HDL-C and apo A-I more than atorvastatin at higher doses, with evidence of a negative dose response effect on HDL-C and apo A-I with atorvastatin, but not simvastatin.

### Safety of aggressive lipid management [^49e749c9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Data from recent clinical trials of high- versus moderate-dose statin therapy support the recommendation to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) < 100 mg/dl in high-risk patients and reveal that many patients will require a high-dose statin to achieve this goal. Overall, low rates of serious musculoskeletal (< 0.6%) and hepatic (< 1.3%) toxicity have been observed with high-dose statin therapy. In the long-term trials, atorvastatin 80 mg had higher rates of persistent transaminase elevations but rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis similar to lower doses of statins. The rate of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis for simvastatin 80 mg, although still low, was about 4x higher than for atorvastatin 80 mg and lower doses of statin. A similar margin of safety would be expected in properly selected patients with characteristics similar to those who participated in the clinical trials. High-dose statin therapy or combination therapy will be required for the large majority of very high-risk patients to achieve the optional LDL goal of < 70 mg/dl. While the combination of ezetimibe, bile-acid sequestering agents, niacin, and fenofibrate with moderate dose statins appears to be reasonably safe, the long-term safety of combination with high-dose statins remains to be established. In order to optimize patient outcomes, clinicians should be aware of specific patient characteristics, such as advancing age, gender, body mass index, or glomerular filtration rate, which predict muscle and hepatic statin toxicity.

### Effect of high-dose statin therapy on drug-eluting stent strut coverage [^83eeee9d]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The influence of high-dose statin therapy on the serial stent healing process has not been fully investigated. Using optical coherence tomography, the effect of high-dose statin therapy on stent strut coverage was evaluated in drug-eluting stent-treated patients.

Approach and Results

Sixty patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups according to the statin dose (atorvastatin 40 mg as high-dose statin therapy [n = 29] versus pravastatin 20 mg as low-dose statin therapy [n = 31]). Serial optical coherence tomographic evaluation post procedure and at the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups was performed in 50 patients with 54 stents (23 atorvastatin-treated patients versus 27 pravastatin-treated patients). The percentage of uncovered struts was defined as the ratio of uncovered struts/total struts. The primary end point was the percentage of uncovered struts at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary end point was the percentage of uncovered struts at the 3-month follow-up and the comparative percentage change (Δ) of uncovered struts at the 3- and 12-month follow-ups between the different dose statin therapies. The percentage of uncovered struts was 7.4% (range, 4.3%-10.4%) in atorvastatin-treated patients versus 10.6% (range, 5.7%-22.6%) in pravastatin-treated patients at the 3-month follow-up (P = 0.13) and 1.3% (0.3%-3.8%) versus 2.5% (0.9%-9.7%), respectively, at the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.01). The percentage Δ of uncovered struts from 3 to 12 months of follow-up was -7.9 ± 8.5% in atorvastatin-treated patients versus -9.3 ± 12.5% in pravastatin-treated patients (P = 0.67).

Conclusions

This study suggested that high-dose statin therapy might provide a beneficial effect for the vascular healing process after drug-eluting stent implantation.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of high-dose atorvastatin treatment in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia [^47f2013f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the 2-year Atorvastatin versus Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression extension study, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who continued to take atorvastatin 80 mg for an additional 2 years had complete arrest of the progression of mean carotid intima-media thickness (0.89 mm at the start vs 0.90 mm at the end of the study, p = 0.58). In contrast, patients previously taking simvastatin 40 mg had significant regression of intima-media thickness (0.95 mm at the start vs 0.92 mm at the end of the study, p = 0.01). Therefore, both placebo- and statin-treated patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are best treated with high-dose atorvastatin, a therapeutic regimen that induces atherosclerosis regression and is safe and well tolerated over a 4-year period.

### 2013 cholesterol guidelines revisited: percent LDL cholesterol reduction or attained LDL cholesterol level or both for prognosis? [^f807e7e2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends moderate- to high-intensity statins for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but departs from the traditional treat-to-target approach. Whether percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction or attained LDL-C levels add incremental prognostic value to statin dose is not known.

Methods

Patients in the Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trials (patient-level data) randomized to a statin arm (atorvastatin 80 mg/10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg) were chosen. Patients were divided into groups based on attained LDL-C levels (≤ 70 vs > 70 mg/dL) and percent LDL-C reduction (≥ 50% vs < 50%). Primary outcome was major cardiovascular event defined as death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. Incremental prognostic value was assessed by using a forward conditional Cox proportional hazards model. Two models were tested: Model 1: Step 1 statin dose; Step 2 add attained LDL-C levels (continuous variable); Step 3 add percent LDL-C reduction (continuous variable). Model 2: Steps 2 and 3 were reversed.

Results

Among 13,937 patients included in this study, percent LDL-C reduction added incremental prognostic value over both statin dose and attained LDL-C levels (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 26.1 to 47.5; P < .0001). However, attained LDL-C level did not provide incremental prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 47.5 to 47.5; P < .0001 and .94, respectively). Among patients with attained LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL, those with percent LDL-C reduction of < 50% had a significantly higher risk of primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.97; P = 0.002) and stroke (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.46–2.93; P < .0001) and a numerically higher risk of death (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.98–1.90; P = 0.06) when compared with the group with percent LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%.

Conclusions

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, percent LDL-C reduction provides incremental prognostic value over statin dose and attained LDL-C levels. However, the attained LDL-C level does not provide additional prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^d4ed0ce5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Table 12 — intensity of statin therapy dosing: High-intensity daily dosage ↓ LDL-C ≥ 50% includes Atorvastatin, 40–80 mg and Rosuvastatin, 20–40 mg, while moderate-intensity daily dosage ↓ LDL-C 30% to < 50% includes Atorvastatin, 10–20 mg, Rosuvastatin, 5–10 mg, and Simvastatin, 20–40 mg; individual responses to statin therapy should be expected to vary in clinical practice, and moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy is preferred unless not tolerated.

### Overuse of statins in older adults… [^260c11fb]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

He had a coronary stent placed 15 years ago for asymptomatic coronary artery disease that was detected after an exercise stress test. He has visited a cardiologist since the stent placement and is taking 80 mg of atorvastatin per day to reduce his LDL cholesterol to below 80 mg per dL. His family physician is uncertain if Mr. G benefits from the high-dose statin because his primary two symptoms are fatigue and muscle weakness. Mr. G's cardiologist feels that the dose is appropriate, and that his symptoms are not related to the statin. Mr. G's family physician plans to keep him on a statin indefinitely, because statins are required for anyone older than 21 years with a diagnosis of CAD according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality indicator #438.

Clinical Commentary The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline states that it may be reasonable to initiate or continue moderate- to high-dose statin therapy for secondary prevention and initiate moderate-dose statin therapy for primary prevention in people older than 75 years if they have an LDL cholesterol level of 70 to 189 mg per dL. For primary prevention, this means that 18 million older adults could be eligible for a statin. 6 A total of 5, 804 patients 70 to 82 years of age with a history of CAD were randomized to 40 mg of pravastatin per day or placebo and were followed for three years. The primary endpoint occurred in 21 out of 1, 000 fewer pravastatin users compared with those using placebo; however, there was no reduction in overall mortality.

Resolution of Case Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines mandate the use of a statin for Mr. G because of his distant history of CAD, the evidence does not support a benefit from continuing a high-dose statin, which could increase his risk of adverse effects. In addition, although Mr. G has no muscle pain, he has muscle weakness and fatigue. After a shared decision-making discussion, Mr. G and his family decide that the uncertain, but likely small, potential benefit of atorvastatin use does not outweigh the potential harms given his clinical situation. He chooses to stop taking the drug.

### Preoperative high-dose atorvastatin for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^81ce715a]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The preventative effect of statins on postoperative atrial fibrillation has been hypothesized. However, all studies to date have examined patients who did not receive statins before their further allocation to treatment or no treatment. Because guidelines recommend the routine use of statins in patients with coronary artery disease, we set out to examine the effect of intensive statin pretreatment versus continuation of usual statin dose on atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.

Methods

Patients receiving routine statin treatment and undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or aortic valve replacement with no history of atrial fibrillation or antiarrhythmic medication were randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg for 7 days before surgery in a single-blind fashion. The primary end point was the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation during hospital stay.

Results

A total of 104 consecutive patients were included. Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 33 patients (32.4%). No significant differences were found in demographics, medical history, or intraoperative variables between treatment groups, with the exception of higher rate of β-blocker use in the atorvastatin 10 mg group (75% vs 53%, P = 0.002) and previous myocardial infarction (62% vs 42%, P = 0.049). The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was lower in the atorvastatin 80 mg group when compared with the atorvastatin 10 mg group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (29% vs 36%, P = 0.43).

Conclusions

High-dose atorvastatin for 7 days before cardiac surgery conferred a nonsignificant reduction in postoperative atrial fibrillation when compared with a low-dose regimen. A larger study would be necessary to confirm the beneficial effect of high-dose statins in this setting.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^55d36511]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — KDIGO dose recommendations and SHARP evidence in CKD: The KDIGO guideline did not compare or harmonize their recommendations to other lipid guidelines, and the strongest evidence base cited is SHARP, which enrolled individuals older than 40 years with a serum creatinine level ≥ 1.7 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 27 ± 13 (SD) mL/min/1.73 m². There is less trial evidence for individuals with CKD who do not meet SHARP entry criteria. A noted difference from ACC/AHA is that KDIGO recommends reducing the dose of statins in individuals with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (ie, avoiding high-intensity statins). In the absence of studies showing adverse effects with higher doses, the authors caution this may cause confusion for those with CKD and a history of acute coronary syndrome, for whom the recommendation is to treat with a high-intensity statin. They also note that labeling states dose adjustment for kidney disease is not required for atorvastatin and that rosuvastatin labeling does not recommend dose adjustment until creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### High-dose atorvastatin on the pharmacodynamic effects of double-dose clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions: the ACHIDO (atorvastatin and clopidogrel HIgh DOse in stable patients with residual high platelet activity) study [^60e0c9a2]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of high-dose atorvastatin on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of double-dose clopidogrel in statin-naive patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and high-on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) while on standard-dose clopidogrel before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Patients with HTPR are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events after PCI. High-dose statins improve prognosis in high-risk patients by lipid- and nonlipid-related mechanisms, including antithrombotic effects.

Methods

The ACHIDO (Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel HIgh DOse in stable patients with residual high platelet activity) study was a randomized PD study of high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin in addition to double-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel (atorvastatin group, n = 38) versus double-dose clopidogrel alone (control group, n = 38) in patients with HTPR. HTPR was defined as P2Y(12) reaction units (PRU) ≥ 235 by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. Platelet reactivity was evaluated immediately before PCI and at 10 and 30 days.

Results

Patients randomized to atorvastatin had lower PRU values (188 ± 48 vs. 223 ± 53 PRU, p < 0.01; primary endpoint) and HTPR rates (16% vs. 42%, p < 0.01) at 30 days than patients in the control group. Statin treatment (odds ratio [OR]: 3.8, p = 0.011), baseline PRU < 298 (OR: 10.7, p = 0.0001), noncarrier status of CYP2C19✱2 loss-of-function allele (OR: 2.9, p = 0.043), and age (OR: 0.94, p = 0.032) were variables significantly associated with optimal PD response (PRU < 235) at 30 days. No correlations were found between PRU and lipid fractions.

Conclusions

High-dose atorvastatin significantly improved the PD effects of double-dose clopidogrel in our stable CAD patients with HTPR undergoing PCI (Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel HIgh DOse in stable patients with residual high platelet activity [ACHIDO]; NCT01335048).

### Potent anti-ischaemic effects of statins in chronic stable angina: incremental benefit beyond lipid lowering? [^0bd59bd9]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Effects of atorvastatin

Previous studies in patients with acute coronary syndromes or after MI have shown similar rapid benefits in ischaemic events or mortality using high-dose atorvastatin. Patients were titrated rapidly to the maximum dose of 80 mg so that we were unable to determine whether a lower dose would have been effective in reducing myocardial ischaemia, as has been reported for clinical outcomes. We included a combination arm to explore the potential benefit for dual therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin and powered our study on the basis of a modest anti-ischaemic effect from atorvastatin. The unexpectedly large reduction in TMI observed with atorvastatin (52% of patients were rendered ischaemia-free), however, precluded the possibility of investigating potential additive or synergistic actions of the two drugs in combination.

Mechanisms of action

Although the benefit on TMI was seen with both amlodipine and atorvastatin, the underlying mechanisms are likely to differ. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was reduced only in the atorvastatin arms (as previously recorded in other populations), and no change was seen accompanying TMI reduction with amlodipine. This clearly does not imply a causal role for C-reactive protein in the pathogenesis of TMI or angina.

Statins are known to reduce vascular inflammation and oxidative stress and improve endothelial function. All of these processes may contribute to disturbances in coronary flow regulation during normal daily life and lead to TMI. Our study was not designed to examine the quantitative relation between the degree of LDL-C lowering or inflammatory markers and change in activity of TMI. We cannot therefore draw conclusions about the relative contribution of cholesterol lowering and 'pleiotropic' effects on the substantial improvement in ischemia seen with atorvastatin therapy.

### Treatment with ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin compared with higher-dose atorvastatin alone: is sufficient cholesterol-lowering enough to inhibit platelets? [^bf6d4cdc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to test the platelet inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects of a higher statin dosage compared with combined treatment with ezetimibe plus a low statin dose.

Background

Reducing the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins induces important pleiotropic effects such as platelet inhibition. An insufficient LDL-C reduction often is treated with ezetimibe, an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in combination with a low statin dose. It is not known whether this combination therapy has the same pleiotropic effects as a statin monotherapy.

Methods

Fifty-six patients with coronary artery disease were assigned randomly to receive either 40 mg/day of atorvastatin or 10 mg/day of ezetimibe plus 10 mg/day of atorvastatin for 4 weeks. The levels of LDL-C, platelet activation markers after stimulation, platelet aggregation, and plasma chemokine levels (i.e., regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]) were measured before and after changing lipid-lowering medication.

Results

Platelet activation markers (P-selectin) after stimulation (adenosine diphosphate) were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin (-5.2 ± 1.6 arbitrary units) but not by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin (2.1 ± 1.8 arbitrary units; p < 0.005) despite a similar reduction of LDL-C (atorvastatin -1.01 ± 0.18 mmol/l vs. ezetimibe plus atorvastatin -1.36 ± 0.22 mmol/l, p = NS). Thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation as well as plasma RANTES levels were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin but not by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin.

Conclusions

Platelet reactivity and a proinflammatory chemokine were reduced more by the higher atorvastatin dose than by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin. In patients with coronary artery disease, it might be important to combine ezetimibe with higher statin dosages to benefit from cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects.

### Efficacy of atorvastatin on renal function in patients with contrast-induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention [^d2b7c0c2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this work, it was found that high-dose atorvastatin demonstrated significant potential in preventing CIN. By comparing the renal function indicators and inflammatory biomarkers between the Exp and Ctrl groups, it was observed that high-dose atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of Scr, BUN, and CysC, while also significantly improving the eGFR. Additionally, it was found that high-dose atorvastatin effectively reduced inflammation and oxidative stress responses, thereby protecting renal function from the damage caused by contrast agents. Despite the significant results of this work, there are still some research limitations that warrant further exploration. Firstly, the study sample was derived from a single hospital, which may have regional and population-specific limitations. Future multicenter, large-sample studies can more comprehensively verify the findings. Secondly, although high-dose atorvastatin showed significant renal protection effects, the detailed mechanisms of action still require further in-depth exploration, including the analysis of its specific impact on inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Future research can further explore the optimal application strategies of atorvastatin at different doses and timings, as well as its long-term safety and effectiveness in clinical practice. In addition, combining other potential protective measures, such as fluid management, the use of low-osmolar contrast agents, and individualized treatment strategies, will help to further improve the effectiveness of CIN prevention. In summary, high-dose atorvastatin as a potential strategy for preventing CIN has important clinical significance and application prospects. However, more in-depth research is still needed to fully assess its advantages and applicability in clinical practice.

### Effects of maximal doses of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin on small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^3dbc34aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Maximal doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels; however, rosuvastatin has been shown to be significantly more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol and in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subclasses. Our purpose in this post hoc subanalysis of an open-label study was to compare the effects of daily oral doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg with atorvastatin 80 mg over a 6-week period on direct LDL cholesterol and small dense LDL (sdLDL) cholesterol in 271 hyperlipidemic men and women versus baseline values. Rosuvastatin was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than atorvastatin in decreasing sdLDL cholesterol (-53% vs -46%), direct LDL cholesterol (-52% vs -50%), total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (-46% vs -39%), and non-HDL cholesterol (-51% vs -48%), The magnitude of these differences was modest, and the 2 statins caused similar decreases in triglyceride levels (-24% and -26%). In conclusion, our data indicate that the 2 statins, given at their maximal doses, significantly and beneficially alter the entire spectrum of lipoprotein particles, but that rosuvastatin is significantly more effective than atorvastatin in lowering direct LDL cholesterol and sdLDL cholesterol.

### Statins in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome: an analysis of dose and class effects in typical practice [^224e9c13]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of statins of different treatment intensity used to treat elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in typical care settings.

Design

Retrospective cohort study using linked hospital and pharmacy claims data.

Setting

Statewide pharmacy benefits programmes in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Participants

18,311 Medicare patients discharged alive after ACS who received a prescription for a statin within 90 days of hospital discharge.

Main Outcome Measures

Using multivariable and propensity-matched Cox proportional hazards regression models, patients who were prescribed high-intensity and moderate-intensity statins were compared based on the drug-dose combination that they initially received. Individual drug-dose combinations were also compared. Our primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death or recurrent ACS.

Results

Patients who received moderate-intensity statins were as likely to experience a primary outcome as patients treated with high-intensity statins (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08). Propensity matching did not change the results. Individually, all moderate-intensity statins were as effective as high-intensity atorvastatin with the exception of lovastatin (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.36). Similarly, all high-intensity statins seem as effective as high-intensity atorvastatin but the CIs surrounding these estimates were wide.

Conclusions

This analysis of elderly patients with ACS treated in typical care settings does not demonstrate the superiority of high-intensity over moderate-intensity statin treatment or significant differences among individual statins.

High-, moderate-, and low-intensity statin therapy dosing and expected LDL-C reduction (Table 5; used in the RCTs reviewed by the expert panel) are summarized as follows: high-intensity therapy "Daily dose lowers LDL-C, on average, by approximately ≥ 50%", with examples "Atorvastatin (40†)–80 mg" and "Rosuvastatin 20 (40) mg"; moderate-intensity therapy "Daily dose lowers LDL-C, on average, by approximately 30% to < 50%", with examples "Atorvastatin 10 (20) mg", "Simvastatin 20–40 mg†", and "Pitavastatin 2–4 mg"; low-intensity therapy "Daily dose lowers LDL-C, on average, by < 30%", with examples "Simvastatin 10 mg", "Pravastatin 10–20 mg", and "Pitavastatin 1 mg".

### Influence of high-dose highly efficient statins on short-term mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for acute coronary syndromes [^fe8f1874]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are recommended for prevention of progression of cardiovascular disease after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although high-dose highly efficient statins are recommended, especially in high-risk patients, clinical data are scarce and further investigation in "real-world" settings is needed. One thousand five hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients, who underwent PCI for acute coronary syndrome, were included in a prospective registry from January 2003 to January 2011. In post hoc analysis, cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and circulating lipid parameters at the time of intervention were evaluated. As a primary end point, all-cause mortality after a follow-up period of 3 months was investigated. Results were compared between patients receiving high-dose highly effective statins (atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg) versus patients receiving low-dose statins or who were without lipid-lowering therapy at the time of discharge. Nine hundred twenty-six patients (60.6%) received high-dose atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and 602 patients (39.4%) received low-dose statin therapy or were not on statins at discharge. Eight patients (0.9%) receiving high-dose statin therapy and 21 patients (3.5%) taking low-dose statins or no statins at discharge died during the 3-month follow-up (hazard ratio 0.244, 95% confidence interval 0.108 to 0.551, p = 0.001). After propensity score adjustment the results remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio for high-dose statins 0.405, 95% confidence interval 0.176 to 0.931, p = 0.033). In conclusion, in this single-center series of 1,528 real-world patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome, a significant reduction in short-term all-cause mortality could be demonstrated in patients receiving high-dose highly efficient statins compared with patients receiving low-dose statins or no lipid-lowering therapy.

Subsequently, "a large-scale RCT… confirmed statin benefit from a moderate-intensity dose… in intermediate-risk patients" enrolling "men ≥ 55 years of age and women ≥ 65 years of age". In that trial's placebo group, "the 10-year risk of 'hard' ASCVD was 8.7%, and the risk of the expanded ASCVD endpoint… was 10%", and "After 5.6 years, those assigned to rosuvastatin 10 mg/d demonstrated significant ARR in both primary endpoints with an acceptable safety record".

### Effect of 80 mg / day simvastatin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in adults with versus without metabolic syndrome [^3fc9d826]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

It is not known whether high-dose statins can reduce the excess burden (and consequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes) of coronary artery disease in patients with metabolic syndrome compared with those without metabolic syndrome. The results of our study suggest that high-dose simvastatin may be required to reduce excess events in very high-risk cohorts with metabolic syndrome.

### Strong decrease of high sensitivity C-reactive protein with high-dose atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^78118dca]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Statins are known to reduce CRP concentrations, but whether high doses are more effective is not known.

Methods

In a prospective double-blind multicenter study in 186 DM2 patients without manifest coronary artery disease and with dyslipidemia, the effect of a 30-week treatment with 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin or placebo on the reduction of hs-CRP levels was measured.

Results

Median CRP levels increased with 6.6% in the placebo group and were reduced by 15 and 47%, respectively, with atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg (P < 0.001; significantly different from 10 mg atorvastatin and from placebo (P < 0.001). Variation in IL-6 and plasma lipids associated for 21 and 8%, respectively, with variation in CRP levels (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01). Of patients with a baseline CRP level above an arbitrary threshold of 3.0 mg/l, 56% in the 80 mg atorvastatin group reached a level of less than 3.0 mg/l, versus 23% randomized to 10 mg atorvastatin (P < 0.01) and 17% in the placebo group (P < 0.005).

Conclusions

In DM2 patients high dose atorvastatin induced a strong reduction in CRP levels. The decrease in CRP was mainly independent of effects on lipid lowering and changes in IL-6 levels. The pleiotropic effect of high-dose atorvastatin on inflammation could add to its cardioprotective effect in high-risk patients.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^7a9aa248]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ASCVD survival analysis

For all 3 drugs, our time-to-event survival analyses highlight the potential for dose-response traits to independently predict ASCVD events and/or death following statin initiation. In this way, our models validate known risk factors and extend the knowledge encompassing our understanding of ASCVD risk predictors to include potency and efficacy. An increase in E max was observed to be associated with increased risk of an ASCVD event or death. The observed effect of E max is likely driven in part by baseline LDL-C levels, which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with cardiovascular mortality. Our findings of increased risk with higher E max may reflect that those who had a higher E max had increased lipid reserve from which to lower LDL-C levels. This claim is further supported by the observation that increases in E 0, an estimate of LDL-C prior to statin therapy, were also associated with increased event risk in our analyses. Therefore, baseline LDL-C levels remain an important factor to consider consistent with established guidelines, with new information added by E max. Importantly, we also observed that ED 50 is independently associated with reduced risk of an ASCVD event. This key statin parameter is well understood to influence outcome at the population level, but it is rarely used clinically to guide drug selection and dosing at the individual level. Our data suggest that ED 50 should be considered as a factor in prescribing at the individual level.

Interestingly in our clinical practice-based data, ED 50 was inversely associated (HR < 1.00) with our primary outcome, defined as an ASCVD event or death from any cause. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis for each statin with ED 50 stratified into the top 50% vs bottom 50% revealed that P = 0.05 for atorvastatin (n = 518). Because individual patients who experience lower potency (higher ED 50) with statins typically require treatment with a higher dose to achieve the desired reduction in LDL-C, the lower ASCVD event rate seen in these patients may reflect beneficial off-target effects of the higher doses. More work is needed to characterize this potency effect in larger aggregate data sets across multiple institutions for different statins and to understand the underlying biology ("on-target" or "off-target" effect).

### High-dose versus low-dose pitavastatin in Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease (REAL-CAD): a randomized superiority trial [^b9f36e00]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

REAL-CAD is a pragmatic physician-initiated trial exploring the optimal dose of statins for patients with established stable CAD within the range of approved doses in Japan. Despite current guidelines recommendations, rates of use of high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40/80 mg, rosuvastatin 20/40 mg) in patients with established CAD have been reported to be low in Asia (0%–25%). – It is important to note that the statin dose in the high-dose group (pitavastatin 4 mg/d) in this study is equivalent to atorvastatin 20 mg/d in terms of LDL-C lowering, indicating that high-dose pitavastatin therapy in this study is what is generally considered moderate-intensity statin therapy in the international medical community. Most of the doses of high-intensity statin therapy defined in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline are not approved in Japan. Furthermore, maximum approved doses of statins are prescribed very infrequently in Japan, even for secondary prevention. The mean LDL-C before the run-in period was 93 mg/dL with 91% of patients taking statins, which decreased to 88 mg/dL after the run-in period on pitavastatin 1 mg. This minimal decrease in LDL-C during the run-in period suggests that the standard of care in Japan was low-intensity statin therapy, highlighting the results of the present study as practice changing. The present study clearly demonstrated that, even in a dose range lower than the dose levels defined as high-intensity statin therapy, the higher statin dose was associated with greater protection from cardiovascular events than the lower statin dose. Furthermore, the favorable effect of high-dose pitavastatin was observed regardless of the baseline LDL-C level dichotomized as ≥ 95 and < 95 mg/dL.

### Statins for the primary prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity: a comprehensive review [^763c562f]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Statin Choice and Dose

High-intensity statin regimens were utilized in all the recent RCTs. Atorvastatin 40 mg was used in all RCTs, except for the trial by Nabati et al. which employed rosuvastatin 20 mg. In a recent meta-analysis of RCTs, a leave-one sensitivity analysis with removal of the trial by Nabati et al. did not negatively impact the results for the efficacy endpoints. This suggests that both high intensity atorvastatin and rosuvastatin may be effective in preventing CTRCD. Other statins or lower-intensity statin regimens have not been evaluated in RCTs.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^065fdea4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Current evidence indicates that kidney‐protective effects of statins show a heterogeneous picture. Statins reduce, for instance, biomarkers for kidney damage, including albuminuria, 9, 10 but not uniformly so. 11 In addition, various controlled trials show that statins are beneficial by inducing a smaller estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction at the end of the study, 12, 13 and other studies indicate that eGFR may even improve. 14, 15, 16 The heterogeneous effects may depend on both the dose and type of statin used, as also demonstrated by the recent PLANET trials in both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD patients. 11 In PLANET, rosuvastatin negatively influenced kidney function, as expressed by decreased eGFR and increased proteinuria, whereas atorvastatin improved GFR without influencing proteinuria. 11

We set out to address whether the high‐potency statin, atorvastatin, has an effect on age‐related kidney function decline during an observation period extending beyond 12 months and whether this effect is dose dependent. Finally, we assessed whether the slopes of individual patients predicted cardiovascular outcome measures.

### Meta-analysis of comparative efficacy of increasing dose of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin versus simvastatin on lowering levels of atherogenic lipids (from VOYAGER) [^e93acd3f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statins, the impact of increasing dose has not been fully elucidated. An individual patient data pooled analysis was performed of 32,258 patients in studies comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The impact of increasing dose on lowering LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B was investigated. Doubling the dose of each statin was accompanied by a 4% to 7% greater degree of lowering of all atherogenic lipids. A stronger correlation was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) or apolipoprotein B (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) than triglycerides (r = 0.14, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline lipid level (p < 0.0001) and increasing statin dose (p < 0.0001) were strong predictors of achieving treatment goals in high-risk patients. Increasing age was a strong independent predictor of achieving goal for all atherogenic lipids (p < 0.0001). Achieving LDL cholesterol goals was also more likely in women (p < 0.0001), patients with diabetes (p < 0.0001), and patients without atherosclerotic disease (p = 0.0002). In contrast, normal triglyceride levels were more often observed in men (p < 0.0001) and patients without diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03). In conclusion, doubling statin dose was associated with greater lowering of LDL cholesterol by 4% to 6% and non-HDL cholesterol by 3% to 6%. Greater lipid goal achievement with increasing dose supports the use of high-dose statin therapy for more effective cardiovascular prevention.

### Effect of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin in 628 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia: a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial [^4f5a4df4]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the established efficacy of statins, many patients do not achieve recommended LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Contributing factors may be inadequate dosing, increased risk for adverse effects with high-dose monotherapy, and increased potential for intolerance and adverse effects with combinations of available agents.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind study, 628 patients with baseline LDL-C 145 to 250 mg/dL and triglycerides ≤ 350 mg/dL were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following for 12 weeks: ezetimibe (10 mg/d); atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); ezetimibe (10 mg) plus atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was percentage reduction in LDL-C for pooled ezetimibe plus atorvastatin versus pooled atorvastatin treatment groups. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin significantly improved LDL-C, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL-C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) compared with atorvastatin alone (P < 0.01). Coadministration of ezetimibe provided a significant additional 12% LDL-C reduction, 3% HDL-C increase, 8% triglyceride reduction, and 10% hs-CRP reduction versus atorvastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 50% to 60%, triglyceride reductions of 30% to 40%, and HDL-C increases of 5% to 9%, depending on atorvastatin dose. LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe plus 10 mg atorvastatin (50%) and 80 mg atorvastatin alone (51%) were similar.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to atorvastatin alone and to placebo. When coadministered with atorvastatin, ezetimibe provided significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and triglycerides and increases in HDL-C. Coadministration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin offers a well-tolerated and highly efficacious new treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with statins for coronary heart disease: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^be4cbf5d]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of statins for coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

Efficacy outcomes included changes in blood lipids, risk of CHD mortality and all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes were evaluated by the risk of adverse events (AE). Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to compare the direct and indirect effects between different statins.

Results

The systematic review showed that levels of blood lipids decreased during statin treatment. High dose of atorvastatin was the most obvious treatment for the reduction of blood lipids. Network meta-analysis showed that statins were significantly more effective than the control in reducing the risk of CHD mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.61–0.77) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80–0.87). In terms of reducing the risk of CHD morality, fluvastatin (77.3%), atorvastatin (72.3%) and lovastatin (68.4%) had higher cumulative probability than other statins, which were more effective treatments for the reduction of CHD morality. In terms of reducing all-cause mortality, atorvastatin (78.6%), fluvastatin (77.1%) and pitavastatin (74.1%) had higher cumulative probability than other statins, which were more effective treatment for reducing the all-cause mortality. Compared with placebo, statins increased the incidence risk of muscle disease (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.10) and kidney disease (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05–1.72).

Conclusions

Statins significantly reduced levels of blood lipids, with a high dose of atorvastatin being the most effective in blood-lipid level modification. Statins reduced the risk of CHD mortality and all-cause mortality, with atorvastatin and fluvastatin being the most effective in reducing the risk of CHD mortality and all-cause mortality. Statins increased the risk of muscle disease and kidney damage.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^730fd4ac]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

Statin therapy selection and intolerance — although high-intensity statin therapy is preferred, it may not be tolerated or may be contraindicated due to clinically significant drug–drug interactions; statin intolerance is defined as adverse effects that improve or resolve with dose modification or discontinuation and requires a trial of at least 2 statins with one at the lowest approved daily dose; clinicians should also consider the possibility of a "nocebo effect"; for patients unable to tolerate a high-intensity statin, a moderate-intensity statin should be used, and additional strategies (eg, low-intensity statin, alternative daily dosing) may also be used to identify a tolerable regimen, though it is unclear if these strategies reduce ASCVD events.

### Rationale and design of a randomised double-blind 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing the effect of a 3-month intensive statin and antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute mild ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA with intracranial or extracranial atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) [^3c63d7e6]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unclear if intensive antiplatelet and statin treatments begun within 24-72hours of cerebral ischaemic events from intracranial or extracranial atherosclerosis is effective or safe.

Methods

The Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for High-risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre and 2×2 factorial trial. 6100 individuals between the ages of 35 and 80 who have experienced a mild ischaemic stroke or high-risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within the previous 72 hours that is attributed to ≥ 50% atherosclerotic stenosis of a major intracranial or extracranial artery or multiple infarctions of atherosclerotic origin will be enrolled in the trial. Eligible subjects will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to one of four groups: (1) intensive antiplatelet therapy (combined clopidogrel and aspirin for days 1–21, then aspirin placebo and clopidogrel for days 22–90) plus immediate intensive statin therapy(atorvastatin at a dose of 80mg daily for the first 21 days, then 40mg daily for days 22–90); (2) intensive antiplatelet therapy plus delayed intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin placebo for days 1–3, followed by 40mg per day of atorvastatin for days 4–90); (3) standard antiplatelet therapy (combination of clopidogrel placebo with aspirin for 90 days) plus immediate intensive statin therapy and (4) standard antiplatelet therapy plus delayed intensive statin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is any new stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) within 90 days after randomisation. The primary safety endpoint is moderate to severe bleeding at 90 days.

Conclusion

The INSPIRES trial will assess the efficacy and safety of intensive antiplatelet therapy and immediate intensive statin therapy begun within 72 hours of onset in decreasing the recurrent stroke at 90 days in patients with acute mild ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA of intracranial or extracranial atherosclerosis origin.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with high-dose statins — evidence synthesis: The effect of high-dose statins on the risk for ICH is uncertain; a meta-analysis of seven RCTs reported increased ICH with high-dose statins versus control, while a more comprehensive meta-analysis did not show increased ICH risk (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.88–1.32) regardless of LDL-C reduction or level achieved.

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0177cf9f]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This network meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of different statin agents at different intensities in adults with diabetes, with a reduction in levels of non-HDL-C as the primary lipid target. The findings derived from a population of 20 193 participants from randomised clinical trials showed that rosuvastatin, given at moderate and high intensity doses, and simvastatin and atorvastatin at high intensity doses, were the best performing statins at lowering levels of non-HDL-C compared with placebo over an average treatment period of 12 weeks. The network model, adjusting for patient risk, showed that of the 4670 adults (40% of the total number of adults) at high risk of major cardiovascular event outcomes (secondary prevention), atorvastatin at high intensity doses was the most effective. Rosuvastatin, at moderate and high intensity doses, and atorvastatin and simvastatin at high intensity doses, were the most effective statin treatment option in the population of 7028 adults at low to medium risk of major cardiovascular events and possible primary prevention.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^fe887d34]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin dosing when eGFR is < 60 — In individuals with CKD and eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² who are not kidney transplant recipients, the KDIGO work group suggests using doses of statins recommended in the general population, but due to concerns of increased toxicity, dose reduction of statins was recommended by KDIGO for individuals with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; given the positive benefit of high-dose atorvastatin in the TNT Trial, one might consider using general population doses for GFR category G3a (45–59.9 mL/min/1.73 m²) or even a high-intensity statin in individuals with acute coronary syndrome and lower eGFR unless there are significant drug interactions.

Discussion

Deadlock of the "statins as monotherapy" strategy

Even using intensive statin monotherapy, many patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia fail to achieve all the desired lipid goals and remain at high residual risk of cardiovascular events. In addition, the prescription of statins in high doses may have important limitations in daily clinical practice: compared with low-dose therapy, intensive statin therapy has been associated with increased incidence of discontinuation, hepatotoxicity and myalgia. Moreover, the incidence of side effects with intensive statin therapy in clinical practice might be higher than the figures reported in clinical trials as a result of the careful selection of patients (such as the exclusion of patients with known previous intolerance to statins). Observational studies suggest that muscle-related symptoms can be frequent in patients on statins; for example, they have been registered in 18.2% of patients receiving simvastatin.

Direct testing of varying degrees of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering by using of active comparators (statin vs. statin) has been tested in 4 large outcomes trials[-]: PROVE IT — TIMI 22, A to Z, TNT and IDEAL. The fifth and largest of the trials comparing intensive vs. standard-dose statins therapy, the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), was expected to report its final conclusions in 2008, but mysteriously disappeared from the scientific horizons (suggestively due to negative results).

The 'scores' of these trials where 'positive' means 'in favor of intensive LDL-C-lowering strategy using statins as monotherapy' are as follows:

1. **PROVE IT — TIMI 22**: high-dose strong atorvastatin (80 mg/day) demonstrated a modest 16% relative reduction in the risk of death and major cardiovascular events vs. medium-dose gentle pravavastatin (80 mg/day), which was observed over the subsequent 2 years following an acute coronary syndrome. It is a "positive" result - in favor of the concept of intensive statin therapy, but it was based on very strange study design.

### A comparison of the effects of low-and high-dose atorvastatin on lipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory cytokines in type 2 diabetes: results from the protection against nephropathy in diabetes with atorvastatin (PANDA) randomized trial [^2881545b]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Statin therapy is recommended in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) although views on treatment intensity and therapeutic targets remain divided.

Objectives

Our objectives were to compare the effects of high-intensity and moderate-intensity atorvastatin treatment on lipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory markers and how frequently treatment goals are met in high-risk T2DM patients.

Methods

Patients with T2DM and albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 5 mg/mmol, total cholesterol < 7 mmol/L, proteinuria < 2 g/d, creatinine < 200 μmol/L) were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 59) or 80 mg (n = 60) daily. Baseline and 1-year follow-up data are reported.

Results

Patients were at high cardiovascular disease risk (observed combined mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular disease annual event rate 4.8%). The non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) goal of < 2.6 mmol/L was achieved in 72% of participants receiving high-dose atorvastatin, but only in 40% on low-dose atorvastatin (P < .005). The proportion achieving apolipoprotein B (apoB) < 0.8 g/L on high-dose and low-dose atorvastatin was 82% and 70%, respectively (NS). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-HDL-C, oxidized LDL, apoB, glyc-apoB, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 decreased significantly, more so in participants on high-dose atorvastatin. Adiponectin increased and serum amyloid A decreased without dose dependency. Neither dose produced significant changes in HDL-C, cholesterol efflux, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycated hemoglobin, serum paraoxonase-1, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein.

Conclusions

High-dose atorvastatin is more effective in achieving non-HDL-C therapeutic goals and in modifying LDL-related parameters. Recommended apoB treatment targets may require revision. Despite the increase in adiponectin and the decrease in serum amyloid A, HDL showed no change in functionality.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Table 3. High-, moderate-, and low-intensity statin therapy — statin therapy is divided into three categories, with high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity therapies typically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ≥ 50%, 30%–49%, and < 30%, respectively. Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### Comparison of benefits and risks of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin from a meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^ce949a39]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. However, adverse events appear to be related to dose rather than LDL cholesterol reduction. Although serious side effects are rare, any comparison of statins requires scrutiny of the relation between therapeutic effect and risk of side effects. This report sought to determine whether the additional LDL cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin over atorvastatin could be obtained without increased risk of short-term adverse events. Twenty-five studies (approximately 20,000 patients) were identified that provided 28 comparisons of 1:1 dose ratios, 20 comparisons of 1:2 dose ratios, and 6 comparisons of 1:4 dose ratios. Treatment difference in benefit (percentage of LDL cholesterol reduction) and risk (odds ratios for myalgia, increased alanine aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal, and percentage of change in glomerular filtration rate, as well as deaths, serious adverse events, and withdrawals caused by adverse events) were estimated using meta-analysis and presented in benefit-risk planes. Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than the same dose of atorvastatin (1:1 dose ratio) or a 2 times higher dose (1:2 dose ratio) of atorvastatin. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and a 4 times higher dose of atorvastatin (1:4 dose ratio). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at any dose ratio for adverse events. Percentages of change in GFR improved significantly with both treatments. In conclusion, at 1:1 and 1:2 dose ratios, significant additional decreases in LDL cholesterol were obtained using rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin at a similar risk of the adverse events presented.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^316f0a16]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < .001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < .05 and P < .001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg starting dosage without the need for titration, compared with 59% of patients treated with atorvastatin. Both treatments were well tolerated over 52 weeks.

Conclusion

Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, which may offer advantages in LDL-C goal attainment over existing lipid-lowering therapies.

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^e4bd87eb]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The surface under the cumulative ranking curve score provides an overall ranking of each treatment. In reducing levels of non-HDL-C, rosuvastatin at moderate intensity was ranked as the best statin treatment (surface under the cumulative ranking curve 77.5%), the second best treatment was rosuvastatin at high intensity (76.8%), the third best was simvastatin at high intensity (76.7%), followed by atorvastatin at high intensity (76.3%). The treatment with the lowest surface under the cumulative ranking curve score (excluding placebo) was fluvastatin at low intensity (8.5%) (appendix 10).

Figure 3 is a league table of the results of the network meta-analysis comparing the effects of the different statin intensities. Almost all statins were effective compared with fluvastatin and pravastatin at low intensity. Rosuvastatin at high intensity seemed to be the best performing statin in direct comparisons with other statin intensities, but the difference in effect sizes were not significant and showed a small benefit compared with other top performers (that is, rosuvastatin at moderate intensity, simvastatin at high intensity, and atorvastatin at high intensity). To ensure the certainty of evidence, we incorporated the CINeMA judgments into figure 2 and figure 3. The quality of the evidence according to CINeMA was mostly moderate or high overall (appendix 11), and we found no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (appendix 12). Results of the sensitivity analyses of the network meta-analysis by specific statin dose were similar to the main statin intensity model, with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin significantly reducing levels of non-HDL-C (except for rosuvastatin 25 mg) (appendix 13).

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^69a6f147]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy evidence notes and FDA caution — dose considerations for atorvastatin and simvastatin: All of these randomized controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events, and individual responses to statin therapy varied in RCTs and should be expected to vary in clinical practice. Evidence from 1 RCT only supports down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL study. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Plasma coenzyme Q10 predicts lipid-lowering response to high-dose atorvastatin [^107e70f4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a provitamin synthesized via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, and thus may serve as a potential marker of intrinsic HMG-CoA reductase activity. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease CoQ10, although it is unclear whether this is due to reductions in lipoproteins, which transport CoQ10.

Objectives

We evaluated whether baseline plasma CoQ10 concentrations predict the lipid-lowering response to high-dose atorvastatin, and to what extent CoQ10 changes following atorvastatin therapy depend on lipoprotein changes.

Methods

Individuals without dyslipidemia or known cardiovascular disease (n = 84) received atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 16 weeks. Blood samples collected at baseline and after 4, 8, and 16 weeks of treatment were assayed for CoQ10.

Results

Individuals with higher baseline CoQ10:LDL-C ratios displayed diminished absolute and percent LDL-C reductions at 8 and 16 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (P < 0.001 to 0.01). After 16 weeks of atorvastatin, plasma CoQ10 decreased 45% from 762 ± 301 ng/ml to 374 ± 150 ng/ml (P < 0.001). CoQ10 changes were correlated with LDL-C and apolipoprotein B changes (r = 0.27–0.38, P = 0.001–0.02), but remained significant when normalized to all lipoproteins. CoQ10 changes were not associated with adverse drug reactions.

Conclusion

Baseline CoQ10:LDL-C ratio was associated with the degree of LDL-C response to atorvastatin. Atorvastatin decreased CoQ10 concentrations in a manner that was not completely dependent on lipoprotein changes. The utility of CoQ10 as a predictor of atorvastatin response should be further explored in patients with dyslipidemia.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^4a2f528d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and are efficacious in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Dose-response to statins varies among patients and can be modeled using three distinct pharmacological properties: (1) E 0 (baseline LDL-C), (2) ED 50 (potency: median dose achieving 50% reduction in LDL-C); and (3) E max (efficacy: maximum LDL-C reduction). However, individualized dose-response and its association with ASCVD events remains unknown.

Objective

We analyze the relationship between ED 50 and E max with real-world cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Method

We leveraged de-identified electronic health record data to identify individuals exposed to multiple doses of the three most commonly prescribed statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin) within the context of their longitudinal healthcare. We derived ED 50 and E max to quantify the relationship with a composite outcome of ASCVD events and all-cause mortality.

Results

We estimated ED 50 and E max for 3,033 unique individuals (atorvastatin: 1,632, simvastatin: 1,089, and rosuvastatin: 312) using a nonlinear, mixed effects dose-response model. Time-to-event analyses revealed that ED 50 and E max are independently associated with the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios were 0.85 (p < 0.01), 0.83 (p < 0.01), and 0.87 (p = 0.10) for ED 50 and 1.13 (p < 0.001), 1.06 (p < 0.001), and 1.15 (p = 0.009) for E max in the atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, respectively.

Conclusion

The class-wide association of ED 50 and E max with clinical outcomes indicates that these measures influence the risk for ASCVD events in patients on statins.

### Statins have biphasic effects on angiogenesis [^d168411e]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to reduce the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids that modulate diverse cell functions. We investigated the effect of the statins cerivastatin and atorvastatin on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Methods and Results

Endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation were enhanced at low concentrations (0.005 to 0.01 micromol/L) but significantly inhibited at high statin concentrations (0.05 to 1 micromol/L). Antiangiogenic effects at high concentrations were associated with decreased endothelial release of vascular endothelial growth factor and increased endothelial apoptosis and were reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In murine models, inflammation-induced angiogenesis was enhanced with low-dose statin therapy (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) but significantly inhibited with high concentrations of cerivastatin or atorvastatin (2.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Despite the fact that high-dose statin treatment was effective at reducing lipid levels in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, it impaired rather than enhanced angiogenesis. Finally, high-dose cerivastatin decreased tumor growth and tumor vascularization in a murine Lewis lung cancer model.

Conclusions

HMG-CoA reductase inhibition has a biphasic dose-dependent effect on angiogenesis that is lipid independent and associated with alterations in endothelial apoptosis and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Statins have proangiogenic effects at low therapeutic concentrations but angiostatic effects at high concentrations that are reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. At clinically relevant doses, statins may modulate angiogenesis in humans via effects on geranylated proteins.

### Magnitude of HDL cholesterol variation after high-dose atorvastatin is genetically determined at the LDL receptor locus in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^11913bb9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The combination of LDL apheresis with high doses of a potent hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, such as atorvastatin, has been the best therapy available for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFH). However, some concerns have been made about the effect of atorvastatin on HDL cholesterol levels in these patients.

Methods and Results

HDL cholesterol levels were determined bimonthly over the course of 2 years of treatment with high-dose atorvastatin in genotypically defined HFH patients either receptor-defective (n = 6) or receptor-negative (n = 6) under long-term treatment with LDL apheresis. We additionally stratified the atorvastatin effect on HDL cholesterol according to the genotype as an indicator of residual in vivo LDL receptor activity. Our findings indicate that (1) an early and transitory reduction of plasma HDL cholesterol levels occurs during the first 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment; (2) the degree of the transient HDL reduction is higher in receptor-negative than in receptor-defective patients (-21 ± 11 versus -10 ± 4%; P = 0.01); and (3) after long-term treatment, HDL cholesterol concentration remains higher in receptor-defective than receptor-negative patients (P = 0.026).

Conclusions

The present study reveals that HDL cholesterol reduction after high-dose atorvastatin is an early and transient event in HFH patients which magnitude depends on the presence of a residual LDL-R activity.

### The high-dose rosuvastatin once weekly study (the HD-ROWS) [^59955f88]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alternative dosing is often used clinically to address common barriers with statin therapy, such as intolerance and cost. Previous findings have demonstrated significant and clinically similar reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to daily dosing, when comparing similar total weekly doses.

Objective

To determine whether rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly produced comparable lipid and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) changes to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, when measured at key points after last dose.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 8-week pilot study. Eligible subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, had documented dyslipidemia with LDL cholesterol > 100 mg/dL and triglycerides < 200 mg/dL. Participants were randomized to receive either rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly (n = 10) or atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 10), for 8 weeks. Lipid panels and hsCRP were measured at baseline and 1–4 and 5–8 days after the last dose.

Results

Participants in each arm experienced significant and comparable reductions from baseline in total cholesterol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and overall LDL cholesterol (-29%). Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP were nonsignificant and similar between groups. Each regimen was well tolerated, with no major adverse events reported.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly produced comparable lipid changes to atorvastatin 10 mg daily when measured at specific points after the last dose. Our findings support previous data demonstrating a significant reduction in LDL-C with once weekly statin dosing.

### Comparative safety of atorvastatin 80 mg versus 10 mg derived from analysis of 49 completed trials in 14, 236 patients [^016d6401]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Atorvastatin has been shown to reduce coronary events and revascularization procedures in patients with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. Recent studies with atorvastatin 80 mg support the overall safety of this dose during long-term treatment. However, physicians appear reluctant to use high doses of statins. A retrospective analysis of pooled data from 49 clinical trials of atorvastatin in 14,236 patients treated for an average period of 2 weeks to 52 months was conducted. The study compared the safety of atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 7,258), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 4,798), and placebo (n = 2,180) and included analyses on treatment-associated adverse events; nonserious and serious adverse events related to the musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal systems; the incidence of elevations of creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); and hepatic transaminases > 3 times ULN. Percentages of patients experiencing ≥ 1 adverse event were similar across all 3 groups. Withdrawals due to treatment-related adverse events were observed in 2.4%, 1.8%, and 1.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare and seldom led to treatment withdrawal with any dose. Treatment-associated myalgia was observed in 1.4%, 1.5%, and 0.7% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in any group. Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases > 3 times ULN were observed in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of treatment-associated adverse events for atorvastatin 80 mg was similar to that of atorvastatin 10 mg and placebo. In conclusion, the results of this analysis support the positive safety profile of atorvastatin at the highest dose.

### Atorvaliq [^dffdc044]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of atorvastatin 10 mg/day on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.

Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the atorvastatin group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37%, HR 0.63, 95% CI (0.48, 0.83) (p = 0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of atorvastatin was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels.

Atorvastatin significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48% (21 events in the atorvastatin group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.89) (p = 0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42% (38 events in the atorvastatin group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1% CI (0.39, 0.86) (p = 0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death.

There were 61 deaths in the atorvastatin group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p = 0.059).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^b9786881]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

United Kingdom National Institute of Care and Health Excellence (NICE) guidance — older adults: Because the Framingham model is not well validated in those > 75 years of age, clinical judgment regarding the use of drug therapy should be used. In secondary prevention, the guideline recommends the use of high intensity statin (i.e., atorvastatin 80 mg), with the option to consider a lower dosage in those with potential drug interactions, high risk of adverse effects, or patient preference. For primary prevention up to age 84 years, the provider should discuss lifestyle modification and optimize other modifiable ASCVD risk factors with repeat assessment; if lifestyle change is ineffective or inappropriate, a moderate intensity statin (i.e., atorvastatin 20 mg) is advised for those with a ≥ 10% 10-year ASCVD risk using QRISK2, in which ASCVD includes CHD (angina and MI), stroke, and transient ischemic attack, but not peripheral arterial disease; QRISK2 has been validated in populations ranging from 30–84 years of age.

### Atorvaliq [^5bd4264e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

### Atorvastatin for high-risk statin-naïve patients undergoing noncardiac surgery: the lowering the risk of operative complications using atorvastatin loading dose (LOAD) randomized trial [^3fccfd7c]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Preliminary evidence suggests that statins may prevent major perioperative vascular complications.

Methods

We randomized 648 statin-naïve patients who were scheduled for noncardiac surgery and were at risk for a major vascular complication. Patients were randomized to a loading dose of atorvastatin or placebo (80 mg anytime within 18hours before surgery), followed by a maintenance dose of 40 mg (or placebo), started at least 12hours after the surgery, and then 40 mg/d (or placebo) for 7days. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, and stroke at 30days.

Results

The primary outcome was observed in 54 (16.6%) of 326 patients in the atorvastatin group and 59 (18.7%) of 316 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.60–1.26, P = 0.46). No significant effect was observed on the 30-day secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality (4.3% vs 4.1%, respectively; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.53–2.47, P = 0.74), nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.4% vs 4.4%, respectively; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.35–1.68, P = 0.50), myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (13.2% vs 16.5%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53–1.19, P = 0.26), and stroke (0.9% vs 0%, P = 0.25).

Conclusion

In contrast to the prior observational and trial data, the LOAD trial has neutral results and did not demonstrate a reduction in major cardiovascular complications after a short-term perioperative course of statin in statin-naïve patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. We demonstrated, however, that a large multicenter blinded perioperative statin trial for high-risk statin-naïve patients is feasible and should be done to definitely establish the efficacy and safety of statin in this patient population.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^2dd08bfd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and are efficacious in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Dose-response to statins varies among patients and can be modeled using 3 distinct pharmacological properties: 1) E 0 (baseline LDL-C), 2) ED 50 (potency: median dose achieving 50% reduction in LDL-C); and 3) E max (efficacy: maximum LDL-C reduction). However, individualized dose-response and its association with ASCVD events remains unknown.

Objectives

The authors analyzed the relationship between ED 50 and E max with real-world cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Methods

We leveraged deidentified electronic health record data to identify individuals exposed to multiple doses of the 3 most commonly prescribed statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin) within the context of their longitudinal health care. We derived ED 50 and E max to quantify the relationship with a composite primary endpoint of ASCVD events (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery revascularization procedure) and all-cause mortality.

Results

We estimated ED 50 and E max for 3,033 unique individuals (atorvastatin: 1,632, simvastatin: 1,089, and rosuvastatin: 312) using a nonlinear, mixed effects dose-response model. Time-to-event analyses revealed that ED 50 and E max are independently associated with the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios were 0.85 (P < 0.01), 0.83 (P < 0.01), and 0.87 (P = 0.10) for ED 50 and 1.13 (P < 0.001), 1.06 (P < 0.001), and 1.15 (P = 0.009) for E max in the atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, respectively.

Conclusions

The class-wide association of ED 50 and E max with clinical outcomes indicates that these measures influence the risk for ASCVD events in patients on statins.

### Statins inhibit rho kinase activity in patients with atherosclerosis [^cc14f790]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In addition to inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) decrease the formation of isoprenoid intermediates required for the activation of key signaling pathways, including Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK). In experimental settings, statins inhibit ROCK and reverse vascular dysfunctions in atherosclerosis, independent of cholesterol reduction. It is not known whether statins inhibit ROCK activity in humans with atherosclerosis.

Methods

We investigated 35 patients with stable atherosclerosis in a randomized, double-blind study comparing treatment with high-dose (80mg/d) or low-dose (10mg/d) atorvastatin to placebo for 28 days. Blood samples for leukocyte ROCK activity, fasting lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were obtained on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 after randomization and change over time with the two statin treatments relative to placebo was examined.

Results

Atorvastatin 80mg/d reduced ROCK activity (p = 0.002 vs. placebo). This decline was rapid and significant within 2 weeks of treatment. The inhibition of ROCK by atorvastatin (80mg/d) remained significant even after controlling for changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (p = 0.01). Furthermore, there was no correlation between changes in ROCK activity and changes in LDL-C (r = 0.2, p = 0.25) or triglycerides (r = 0.1, p = 0.55). There was a modest correlation between ROCK inhibition and change in hs-CRP among patients randomized to atorvastatin 80mg/d (r = 0.6, p = 0.07).

Conclusions

These first-in-man findings demonstrate that high-dose atorvastatin rapidly inhibits the pro-atherogenic Rho/ROCK pathway, independent of cholesterol reduction. This inhibition may contribute to the clinical benefits of statins. Rho/ROCK may provide a useful therapeutic target in patients with atherosclerosis.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b123e085]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction… [^8489f424]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin, or usual-dose simvastatin. Main Outcome Measure Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. In a recent trial among patients with acute coronary syndromes, incremental benefit was demonstrated with more intensive lowering of LDL-C to well below 100 mg/dL. 2 In the Treating to New Targets study comparing high and low doses of atorvastatin in stable nonacute CHD, a significant improvement in prognosis with respect to cardiovascular disease was demonstrated. 3 In that study, however, the benefit of reduced cardiovascular mortality appeared to have been offset by a higher number of deaths due to noncardiovascular causes. The Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel recently introduced a new target of less than 70 mg/dL for patients at very high risk. 6 The main hypothesis of the current study, the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering study, was that intensive lowering of LDL-C with atorvastatin at the highest recommended dose would yield incremental benefit compared with the moderate, most widely used dose of simvastatin. At 24 weeks of follow-up, 900 patients in the simvastatin group had their dosage increased to 40 mg/d. At the end of the study, 1034 were prescribed simvastatin, 40 mg/d. In patients allocated to receive atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, 250 had their dosage reduced to 40 mg/d by 24 weeks; in 587 patients, the final dose was 40 mg. This also makes it difficult to make reliable comparisons of reported adverse experiences between the 2 treatment regimens. In the IDEAL study, there was a small and nonsignificant excess of 13 more noncardiovascular deaths in the simvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group.

In contrast, atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, was associated with a small and nonsignificant increase in noncardiovascular deaths compared with atorvastatin, 10 mg/d, in the TNT study.

### Neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin in an experimental model of nerve crush injury [^1059d6f8]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Statins have therapeutic benefits for the management of several disorders. A short-term course of a high-dose statin pretreatment has demonstrated neuroprotective effects against neurological diseases. However, the molecular basis underlying the neuroprotective action of statins remains unclear.

Objective

We investigated whether a short-term course of high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment has beneficial effects in protecting sciatic nerve from crush injury.

Methods

Atorvastatin (5 mg/kg) or saline was given orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days before injury. The rats were subjected to crush injury in the left sciatic nerve with a vessel clamp. Biochemical, functional, electrophysiological, and morphological alterations occurring during injury-induced degeneration/regeneration were examined.

Results

Atorvastatin improved injury-induced neurobehavioral/electrophysiological changes and axonal loss. Damage-associated alterations, including structural disruption, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, were attenuated by atorvastatin. After injury, regeneration-associated genes, including growth-associated protein-43, myelin basic protein, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and collagen, were upregulated by atorvastatin. The suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, AKT, signal transducer and activators of transcription-1, and necrosis factor-kappaB and the elevated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, Smad2/3, and activating protein-1 were associated with the neuroprotective action of atorvastatin.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that a short-term course of high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment can protect against sciatic nerve crush injury through modifying intracellular or extracellular environments, making it favorable for regeneration.

### Comparative effects of 10-mg versus 80-mg atorvastatin on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with stable coronary artery disease: results of the CAP (comparative atorvastatin pleiotropic effects) study [^ce39335a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The major beneficial effect of statins- reducing the risk for coronary events-has primarily been ascribed to reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but may in part be related to a direct antiinflammatory action (ie, decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] concentration).

Objectives

The objectives of this CAP (Comparative Atorvastatin Pleiotropic Effects) study were to compare the effects of low- versus high-dose atorvastatin on hs-CRP concentrations and to determine the relationship between changes in LDL-C and hs-CRP concentrations in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), low-grade inflammation, and normal lipoprotein concentrations.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study was conducted at 65 centers across Canada and Europe. Patients with documented CAD, low-grade inflammation (hs-CRP concentration, 1.5–15.0 mg/L), and a normal-range lipid profile (LDL-C concentration, 1.29–3.87 mmol/L [50–150 mg/dL]; triglyceride [TG] concentration, < 4.56 mmol/L [< 400 mg/dL]) were randomly assigned to receive 26-week double-blind treatment with atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg QD. Investigators were to aim for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) LDL-C target of < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline in hs-CRP, as measured at baseline and weeks 5, 13, and 26 using high-sensitivity, latex microparticle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Changes from baseline in LDL-C, as measured directly in serum at the same time points, were also calculated. The secondary efficacy variables included the percentage changes from baseline in lipid parameters (LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], TG, apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, and TC:HDL-C ratio) at 5, 13, and 26 weeks of treatment. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination, including vital sign measurement, and laboratory analyses.

Results

A total of 339 patients were enrolled (283 men, 56 women; mean age, 62.5 years; weight, 81.3 kg; 10-mg/d group, 170 patients; 80-mg/d group, 169). No significant differences in baseline demographic or clinical data were found between the 2 treatment arms. In the 10-mg group, hs-CRP was decreased by 25.0% at 5 weeks and remained stable thereafter (%Delta at week 26, -24.3%; P < 0.01). In the 80-mg group, hs-CRP was decreased by 36.4% at 5 weeks and continued to be decreased over the study period (%Delta, -57.1% at week 26; P < 0.001 vs baseline). At 5 weeks, LDL-C was decreased by 35.9% in the 10-mg group and by 52.7% in the 80-mg group (P < 0.001 between groups) and remained stable thereafter (%Delta at week 26, -34.8% and -51.3%, respectively; P < 0.001 between groups). The NCEP ATP III LDL-C target of < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) was reached in 77.1% of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 mg and 92.3% of those treated with 80 mg (P < 0.001). Dual targets of hs-CRP < 2 mg/L and LDL-C < 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) were reached in a significantly greater proportion of patients in the 80-mg group compared with the 10-mg group (55.6% vs 13.5%; P < 0.001). The decrease in hs-CRP was largely independent of baseline LDL-C and change in LDL-C. Two serious adverse events were reported by the investigator as treatment related: acute hepatitis in the 10-mg group and intrahepatic cholestasis in the 80-mg group, in 2 patients with multiple comorbidities. Two deaths occurred during the study, both in the atorvastatin 80-mg group (1, myocardial infarction; 1, sudden death), neither of which was deemed treatment related by the investigator.

Conclusions

In these patients with documented CAD, evidence of low-grade inflammation, and normal range lipid profiles, the effects of atorvastatin on changes in hs-CRP were dose dependent, with the high dose (80 mg) being associated with significantly greater reductions in hs-CRP concentrations. Both doses were associated with a significant and progressive decline in hs-CRP largely independent of changes in LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. Clinical Trials Identification Number: NCT00163202.

### Effects of increasing doses of atorvastatin on the atherogenic lipid subclasses commonly associated with hypertriglyceridemia [^0bfd1c54]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The increased cardiovascular risk associated with hypertriglyceridemia is thought to be due in part to high levels of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins and small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). In this post hoc analysis, effects of increasing doses of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg) on atherogenic lipid subclasses commonly associated with hypertriglyceridemia were evaluated in 191 men and women who were candidates for lipid-lowering therapy and had baseline TG levels > 200 mg/dl (2.3 mmol/L). After 8 weeks of treatment, in addition to significantly decreasing LDL cholesterol and TG levels, atorvastatin significantly increased LDL peak particle diameter (p < 0.01) and significantly decreased the concentration of small LDL subclasses IIIa and IIIb (p < 0.0001) from baseline at all doses. These effects were more pronounced with higher compared with lower doses of atorvastatin. Each dose of atorvastatin also significantly lowered levels of very LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (p < 0.0001), and small very LDL subclass 3 (p < 0.0001). Greater decreases were achieved by those patients receiving higher doses of atorvastatin (20, 40, and 80 mg). The increase in LDL size correlated with the decrease in TG levels, but not with the decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. However, the decrease in small dense LDL cholesterol concentrations correlated significantly with TG and LDL cholesterol decreases. In conclusion, atorvastatin significantly lowered levels of TG-rich remnant lipoproteins and favorably changed LDL particle size in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. These effects may explain the benefits of statin therapy in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia even when levels of LDL cholesterol are at goal.

### Effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy for coronary artery disease: a post-hoc analysis from the LODESTAR randomized clinical trial [^11ac5a7e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), intensive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy is recommended. However, statin use has been associated with increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). An increased risk of NODM was more frequently observed in patients with higher-intensity statin therapy than in those with lower-intensity statin therapy. While high-intensity statins are generally used as the initial choice for LDL-C lowering therapy in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, only rosuvastatin and atorvastatin can provide high-intensity statin therapy. However, it remains uncertain whether the risk of NODM differs between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Recently, a safety endpoint in the LODESTAR (Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) trial identified a higher incidence of NODM in patients receiving rosuvastatin than in those on atorvastatin. In the previous report, the NODM was only evaluated according to the population randomized (intention-to-treat population), rather than by what each patient actually received (as-treated population). In addition, questions may arise as to whether these findings are dependent on the lipid-lowering efficacy of the medication, as a significantly lower LDL-C level was observed in the rosuvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group.

Therefore, in this post-hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial, we evaluated whether there is a difference in the incidence of NODM between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in a head-to-head comparison with consideration of the type of statin that was actually given, particularly in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy. We also assessed the comparative effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin according to the achieved LDL-C levels.

### A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in reaching low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride targets: the Treat-to-target (3T) study [^dc70161d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease call for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction as the primary target of treatment and reduction of triglycerides (TG) as an additional target.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of atorvastatin and simvastatin to reduce LDL-C and TG concentrations and to meet 3 target lipid levels: LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L; TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L; and both LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L and TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L.

Methods

The Treat-to-Target (3T) Study was a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Using the double-blind, double-dummy technique, adult patients aged 35 to 75 years with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia, defined as LDL-C concentration ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (≥ 155 mg/dL), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin or 20 mg simvastatin. Fasting (12-hour) blood samples for the estimation of lipid levels and clinical laboratory values were collected after 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The dose was doubled after 12 weeks if the target National Cholesterol Education Program level of LDL-C (≤ 2.6 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) was not reached at 8 weeks.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis included 552 patients (418 men, 134 women) randomized to receive atorvastatin and 535 (404 men, 131 women) randomized to receive simvastatin. The number of patients enrolled in the study allowed the evaluation fo the drugs' effects on TG. Patient demogrpahic characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups, and there were no differences in baseline lipid values. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (8 weeks: -46% vs -40%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -49% vs -44%, P < 0.001) and in TG (8 weeks: -23% vs -14%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -24% vs -16%, P < 0.001). Compared with simvastatin-treated patients, a significantly greater number of atorvastatin-treated patients reached the LDL-C target after 8 weeks (45% vs 24%; P < 0.001). Fewer atorvastatin patients needed to have their dose doubled; nevertheless more atorvastatin patients reached the LDL-C target after 52 weeks (61% vs 41%; P < 0.001). Both statins were well tolerated. Muscular symptoms occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group and in 13 patients (2.4%) in the simvastatin group.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d for up to 1 year of treatment was significantly more effective than simvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d in reducing LDL-C and TG levels and at achieving recommended lipid targets in this selected patient population with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. Both statis were well tolerated.

### A new statin: a new standard [^f32a855f]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatments designed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the setting of either primary or secondary prevention. The rationale for aggressive lowering of LDL-C, supported by large observational studies, is the concept that no threshold exists below which reductions fail to provide additional benefit. The statins are widely considered first-line therapy for preventing CHD events because these agents yield the greatest reductions in LDL-C. However, many patients do not achieve target LDL-C levels with the currently available statins. Newer, more effective statins may permit the benefits of aggressive LDL-C reduction to be extended to larger numbers of patients. A novel, highly efficacious statin, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca group of companies), is currently undergoing clinical investigation. Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients have shdwn that rosuvastatin produces significant, dose-dependent decreases in LDL-C when compared with placebo. Reductions have ranged from 34% at a dose of 1 mg/day to 65% at 80 mg/day. This agent has been found to be well tolerated across the range of doses studied. Phase III studies indicate that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic patients, and more effective than atorvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Overall, these findings suggest that rosuvastatin is a promising new medication for the treatment of dyslipidemias.

### Rationale and design of a randomised double-blind 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing the effect of a 3-month intensive statin and antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute mild ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA with intracranial or extracranial atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) [^70b51a29]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lipid-lowering therapy patients who had a stroke

As well known, the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-lowering is similar at a dose of 40 mg and 80 mg per day, especially in the Asian population. While, we found that higher dose of atorvastatin may be related with a higher risk of bleeding and myopathy in Chinese patients. Similar results were reported in several small sample studies in Asians. The risk of major bleeding may be increased when intensive statin, especially at the higher doses, is used with DAPT in acute stage of ischaemic stroke. We would like to explore the safety of a potential interaction of intensive statin with DAPT, and used a dose of 40 mg daily for days 4–21 in the delayed intensive statin group.

In recent years, some trials have reported the effectiveness of ezetimibe and PSK9 inhibitors in conjunction with statin in decreasing LDL-C levels. In the future, there may be more trials exploring their effects in acute ischaemic stroke.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^ae5e4d4d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of the leading causes of death globally. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are a known risk factor for the development of ASCVD such as coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, and stroke. Statins lower circulating LDL-C levels through their inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Correspondingly, statins have been demonstrated to be effective for both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events. While there is wide variability in LDL-C response to each of the 7 clinically used statins in the United States, all of them have been found to reduce ASCVD events.

Despite the robust lipid-lowering efficacy on statins, many individuals on statin therapy still experience cardiovascular events (residual risk). Meta-analysis of ASCVD events in large statin trials demonstrably notes a risk reduction with statin use compared to placebo, but 3% of statin users still experienced an event compared to 3.7% of those in the control group, with median follow-up duration of 4.9 years. These results suggest there are other factors beyond LDL-C reduction that affect the impact of statins on ASCVD risk. Baseline LDL-C is one such factor. It is associated with total and cardiovascular mortality, with a progressive reduction when using more intensive lipid-lowering therapy with baseline LDL-C > 100 mg/dL. Genetic contributors also influence the relationship between statin use and ASCVD event rate. Prior studies of LDL-C response to statins have predominantly utilized a single measure of lab-based efficacy (ΔLDL-C) to quantify the association with event rate, but variable drug action may arise from pharmacodynamic (eg, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and/or pharmacokinetic (eg, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1) gene effects not necessarily captured by quantitative LDL-C change. Furthermore, while ΔLDL-C is a strong contributor to event rate, individual risk for ASCVD events may be more accurately predicted by rigorously defining 2 important pharmacological parameters: E max (maximal lipid-lowering efficacy in mg/dL) and ED 50 (the dose required to reach half-maximal efficacy). The latter of these 2 properties, "potency", has been underdeveloped as a risk prediction tool. Yet, statins developed more recently (eg, rosuvastatin) are known to be much more potent than statins that have been available for several decades (eg, simvastatin).

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^73010106]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Atorvaliq [^70b099fa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Atorvastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Absorption

Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to ATORVALIQ dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Administration of ATORVALIQ with high fat meal resulted in a 30% and 63% decrease in atorvastatin AUC and Cmax, respectively compared with what was observed in the fasted state. The decrease in exposure can be clinically significant, and therefore ATORVALIQ should be taken only on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal)\.

Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.

Distribution

Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is ≥ 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells.

PCSK9 inhibitors — research needs for combination therapy and treatment intensity: There is a need for continued investigation of the long-term safety of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors combined with statins with or without ezetimibe and the unknown safety of prolonged periods of very low LDL-C; topics include what is the optimal combination of lipid-lowering treatments or achieved LDL-C level for the largest reduction in CV events (e.g., adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximally-tolerated statin plus ezetimibe versus moderate-dose statins plus ezetimibe), what is the comparative effectiveness of high-dose statin plus ezetimibe, high-dose statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, and high-dose statin plus ezetimibe plus PCSK9 inhibitor (triple therapy) in higher risk patients, and what is the optimal duration of more aggressive treatment in higher risk patients including whether ACS patients on high-dose statins should continue indefinitely or be titrated downward after a period of time.
