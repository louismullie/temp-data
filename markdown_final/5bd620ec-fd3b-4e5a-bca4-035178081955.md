## Question

How does the urea breath test compare to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the urea breath test (UBT) compares to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for Helicobacter pylori diagnosis and follow-up, including mechanisms, accuracy, and when to use each modality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how each test works and what samples they use. Then, I should compare diagnostic accuracy in pretreatment and posttreatment settings, including special situations like upper GI bleeding. Next, I will align these data with guideline-driven indications for test-and-treat versus endoscopy-first strategies. Finally, I will check modifiers that affect accuracy (PPIs, antibiotics), and consider special populations and scenarios where EGD adds value beyond H. pylori detection.

> Let me first confirm the core characteristics of the UBT. Mechanistically, patients ingest 13C-urea (preferred) or 14C-urea; if H. pylori is present, bacterial urease generates labeled CO2 measurable in exhaled breath, typically within 10–30 minutes, often after a citric acid–based test meal to optimize contact time and accuracy; 13C is preferred in children and pregnancy because it is nonradioactive, and measurement can be done by IRMS or validated infrared/laser-based analyzers, which are acceptable alternatives to mass spectrometry when validated [^1175pAKJ] [^112gekT1] [^116Juv2i] [^11782447].

> I will now examine EGD-based diagnostics. EGD is invasive but enables direct visualization and gastric biopsies for multiple tests: rapid urease testing (RUT), histology with targeted stains, culture for susceptibility testing, and increasingly PCR from biopsy material; sensitivity improves with sampling both antrum and corpus given H. pylori's patchy distribution, and combined histology plus RUT is guideline-recommended when using an invasive approach [^114pRzfP] [^115QeLvf] [^115VwXCF].

> Next, I should review pretreatment diagnostic accuracy. Wait, let me verify the UBT data first. High-quality randomized data show 13C-UBT sensitivity and specificity near 100% with a 25 mg dose, and excellent performance with 15 mg (sensitivity 96.1%, specificity 100%), making UBT the most accurate noninvasive test pre-therapy; lower doses can compromise sensitivity, so dose selection matters [^112Cniuv]. By contrast, RUT sensitivity is highly biopsy-number dependent, rising from roughly two-thirds with a single biopsy to over 90% with multiple biopsies, while specificity remains high; histology is accurate but limited by sampling error unless multiple sites are sampled [^112Pm5yo] [^114pRzfP]. I should confirm guidance on biopsy location — yes, sampling from both antrum and corpus is recommended to mitigate patchiness and PPI effects [^115QeLvf] [^114PKkEA].

> Hold on, I should verify performance in upper GI bleeding where accuracy shifts. In UGIB, pooled analyses show UBT maintains high sensitivity (~93%), whereas biopsy-based methods have substantially reduced sensitivity (RUT ~67%, histology ~70%, culture ~45%) due to decreased bacterial load and sampling challenges; UBT often outperforms biopsy tests in this context, and capsulated low-dose 13C-UBT has also shown feasibility in bleeding patients [^113h5Rx8] [^115DDHyv].

> Next, I need to check posttreatment accuracy and timing. Guidelines consistently recommend a noninvasive test of cure — ideally UBT — at least 4 weeks after completing therapy, and to stop PPIs for about 2 weeks prior to testing to minimize false negatives; monoclonal stool antigen is an acceptable alternative if UBT is unavailable, but serology should not be used to confirm eradication because antibodies persist for months; in RCT follow-up, 15 mg 13C-UBT achieved 100% sensitivity and ~99% specificity for eradication confirmation [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU] [^1175pAKJ] [^112Cniuv].

> Let me consider strategic clinical pathways. For patients under about 60 years with uninvestigated dyspepsia and no alarm features, a noninvasive "test-and-treat" strategy using UBT is recommended by multiple guidelines given accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptability; treatment is offered if positive, and endoscopy is reserved for failures or evolving concerns [^113P4Bxw] [^113rFhj4] [^1175pAKJ]. But wait, I should confirm exceptions — pediatric societies often discourage test-and-treat in children without an accepted endoscopic indication, which is a separate context not addressed here [^113RLjG1].

> Now, I should delineate when EGD is preferred or mandatory. EGD is indicated with alarm features (bleeding, anemia, weight loss, persistent vomiting), in older patients (commonly ≥ 60 years by guideline thresholds), with a family history of gastric cancer, or when focal lesions, suspected ulcers, MALT lymphoma, or early gastric cancer require evaluation and staging; EGD also supports OLGA/OLGIM staging and targeted surveillance in premalignant conditions where histology matters beyond simple H. pylori detection [^114pRzfP] [^113P4Bxw] [^111PiWC7] [^116ov7Qz].

> I need to ensure I address antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility testing. Culture and molecular testing from gastric biopsies enable susceptibility-guided therapy and are increasingly emphasized as resistance rises; while culture is specific, it is technically demanding, benefits from sampling both antrum and corpus, and may fail if transport conditions are suboptimal; PCR on biopsy tissue can augment detection and resistance profiling and may be less affected by PPIs than other biopsy-based methods [^115VwXCF] [^114Ss8xW].

> But wait, what about factors that reduce test accuracy. PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth can suppress bacterial load and yield false-negative UBT and biopsy-based results; thus, PPIs should be withheld for about 14 days and antibiotics/bismuth for 4 weeks before testing when feasible; although a real-time 13C-UBT platform suggested minimal false negatives on PPI in a small series, guidelines still advise PPI cessation when possible given broader evidence [^114LFUCU] [^115QeLvf] [^115QeLvf].

> Let me consider special populations and anatomical alterations. In children and pregnancy, 13C-UBT is preferred over 14C due to the nonradioactive label and has shown high accuracy even in very young children; in post-gastrectomy stomachs and altered anatomy, test performance can differ, and biopsy-based strategies or adjusted UBT protocols may be needed based on meta-analytic performance and local validation [^11782447] [^114qvoLJ] [^115z8uKn].

> I should double-check the bottom line and practical sequencing. For most non-alarm dyspeptic adults, start with UBT, treat if positive, and confirm eradication 4+ weeks after therapy off PPIs; if there are alarm features, older age, or specific neoplastic or premalignant concerns, proceed with EGD and obtain antrum and corpus biopsies for RUT and histology, adding culture/PCR when susceptibility or detailed mucosal assessment is needed; in UGIB, rely on UBT for initial detection given higher sensitivity, recognizing biopsy tests may be falsely negative early on [^113P4Bxw] [^115gTief] [^114pRzfP] [^113h5Rx8].

The urea breath test (UBT) is a **non-invasive, highly accurate** [^112Cniuv] method for detecting active H. pylori infection, with sensitivity and specificity typically > 90% [^113h5Rx8]. It is **preferred for initial diagnosis and post-eradication confirmation** in patients without alarm features or when endoscopy is not indicated [^113P4Bxw] [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU]. EGD is **invasive and comprehensive**, allowing direct visualization with biopsy and histology [^114pRzfP] for H. pylori detection and assessment of mucosal pathology [^114LFUCU]; it is indicated for alarm symptoms, refractory dyspepsia, or suspected complications [^113uFeCT]. UBT can yield false negatives after recent PPI, antibiotic, or bismuth use [^114LFUCU] [^115QeLvf], whereas EGD carries procedural risks and higher costs [^113uFeCT]. The choice depends on clinical context, patient factors, and resource availability [^115mknV7].

## Diagnostic accuracy

UBT shows **sensitivity and specificity > 90%** for active H. pylori infection [^112Cniuv] [^113h5Rx8], while EGD relies on **histology** and rapid urease testing (RUT) from biopsies to provide high accuracy, with **histology as the gold standard** [^114pRzfP] [^114PKkEA].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients without alarm symptoms | UBT | Non-invasive, accurate, and patient-friendly [^113P4Bxw] |
| Post-eradication confirmation of H. pylori infection | UBT | Non-invasive and reliable for confirming eradication [^114LFUCU] [^115gTief] |
| Patients with alarm symptoms (e.g. weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding) | EGD | Allows direct visualization and biopsy of mucosal lesions [^113uFeCT] |
| Refractory dyspepsia or suspected complications (e.g. ulcers, malignancy) | EGD | Comprehensive evaluation and biopsy capability [^114uUgr1] |

## Advantages and limitations

### Urea breath test (UBT)

Advantages include non-invasiveness [^112Cniuv], high accuracy [^113h5Rx8], patient-friendliness with rapid results [^11782447], and suitability for initial diagnosis and post-eradication testing [^115gTief], whereas limitations include risk of **false negatives** with recent PPI, antibiotic, or bismuth use [^114LFUCU] [^1135HfZu], limited availability in some settings, and inability to provide mucosal visualization or biopsy.

---

### Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)

Advantages include direct mucosal visualization, biopsy capability [^114pRzfP], and comprehensive evaluation of gastrointestinal pathology [^114LFUCU]; limitations include **invasiveness**, higher cost, procedural risks (e.g. bleeding, perforation) [^113uFeCT], and patient discomfort.

---

## Patient comfort and safety

UBT is **non-invasive** [^112Cniuv] with minimal discomfort and no procedural risks, whereas EGD is **invasive**, may cause discomfort, and carries procedural risks (e.g. bleeding, perforation) [^113uFeCT].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

UBT is generally **more cost-effective** [^112gekT1] for initial diagnosis and post-eradication testing due to lower costs and non-invasiveness [^113rFhj4], whereas EGD typically incurs **higher costs** [^113uFeCT] because of its invasiveness, procedural risks, and the need for specialized equipment and personnel.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **recommend UBT** for initial diagnosis [^113P4Bxw] and post-eradication confirmation [^115gTief] in patients without alarm symptoms or suspected complications [^114LFUCU], and **EGD** for those with alarm symptoms, refractory dyspepsia, or suspected complications (e.g. ulcers, malignancy) [^114uUgr1].

---

## Summary table: UBT vs. EGD

| **Parameter** | **UBT** | **EGD** |
|-|-|-|
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive [^112Cniuv] | Invasive [^113uFeCT] |
| Accuracy | High (> 90%) [^113h5Rx8] | High (histology gold standard) [^114PKkEA] |

### Accuracy of breath tests using low doses of 13C-urea to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection: a randomised controlled trial [^112Cniuv]. Gut (2006). High credibility.

The 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection is a non-invasive method based on the organism's urease activity. Since its first description, the method has been extensively modified. However, only the dose of 13C-urea and the measurement equipment are directly related to the cost of the test.

- **Aims**: (1) To assess the diagnostic accuracy before eradication therapy of three UBTs using 25, 15, and 10 mg of 13C-urea, respectively; and (2) to determine diagnostic performance in the post-eradication setting, showing the highest values for sensitivity and specificity with the lowest dose of 13C-urea.

- **Methods**: Three hundred consecutive patients were randomized to be tested with one of the three UBTs. All patients underwent upper endoscopy with biopsies. A total of 222 more patients were enrolled to evaluate the second aim. Infected patients were offered treatment and asked to return 4–6 weeks after the end of therapy to perform endoscopic follow-up and to carry out 13C-UBT.

- **Results**: In the pretreatment setting, 13C-UBT 25 mg had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.8–100) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 93.7–100); 13C-UBT 15 mg had a sensitivity of 96.1% (95% CI 86.8–98.9) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 92.6–100); and 13C-UBT 10 mg had a sensitivity of 89.1% (95% CI 77–95.3) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 93.3–100). As the test with the best performance and the lowest dose of 13C-urea was 13C-UBT 15 mg, it was evaluated after treatment, reporting a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 79.6–100) and a specificity of 98.9%.

### Diagnostic approach to-related gastric oncogenesis [^11782447]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The principal noninvasive testing method in use for H. pylori testing is the urea breath test (UBT), a safe, readily available, accurate, and cost-effective method with the highest sensitivity (up to 94%). It is suitable for patients who have contraindications for conventional endoscopy and subsequent biopsy specimens.

Patients are given a test meal with enriched carbon (13 C or 14 C), supplemented with substances such as citric acid or dietary supplements to inhibit gastric emptying and extend the time in the stomach. The concentration of CO2 is measured in the exhaled air. The exhaled 13 CO2 is estimated by mass spectrometry, which yields quick results in-office, while CO2 must be processed by a nuclear medicine laboratory.

13 C is preferred for children and pregnant women because it is harmless, even though the radiation exposure of 14 C is comparable to a person's daily radiation exposure. False-positive results can occur due to the following:

- **Urease activity**, such as from Helicobacter heilmannii.
- **Contamination with oral flora**, or in achlorhydria due to the lack of inhibition of bacterial growth other than H. pylori species (e.g. Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus)

False-negative test results can occur due to a reduction in H. pylori gastric diversity, reported for antibiotics, bismuth compounds, and PPIs. Specifically, decreased sensitivity occurs in the setting of active gastrointestinal infections.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114LFUCU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Statement 7: Posteradication treatment testing must be performed. If gastroscopy is not required, a urea breath test is recommended for posteradication treatment testing. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative if locally validated.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: high.

In line with Maastricht VI guidelines, testing for H. pylori eradication should be performed at least 4–6 weeks following the completion of any therapy for H. pylori. This period of time is required to exclude the possibility of bacterial suppression leading to false negative results. The UBT is recommended for posteradication testing where available. The monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative (see statement 2). As antibodies to H. pylori persist for months following infection, serology is not recommended for eradication confirmation. If endoscopy is performed, biopsy sampling should be performed as described in statements 3–5.

Statement 8: Proton pump inhibitors significantly reduce the accuracy of the recommended H. pylori tests; therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before testing unless PCR testing is available.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: high.

PPIs should be avoided 2 weeks before diagnostic testing by the UBT, stool antigen test, histology, the RUT or culture as they decrease the bacterial load, thus increasing the risk of false negative results. However, the working group notes that as PPIs are now available over the counter, many patients do not avoid PPIs before H. pylori testing.

### A new semiquantitative method of quantifying Helicobacter pylori in antigen stools [^1159Fdix]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The stool antigen test for Helicobacter pylori, a noninvasive assay, is emerging as a strong competitor to the urea breath test (UBT). Nevertheless, although the UBT delta value is a semiquantitative indicator of H. pylori intragastric load, until now, the H. pylori stool antigen test has been utilized only as a qualitative investigation. We report here the results of a study performed with the aim of obtaining a semiquantitative measurement of bacterial quantity in stools.

We studied 15 patients with dyspepsia, confirmed through H. pylori positivity at histology, the rapid urease test, UBT, and the H. pylori stool antigen test. The result of this last test was expressed by a numerical value obtained by applying the principle of "standard points" to the absorbance units at spectrophotometric reading. This measurement was previously validated by testing probe sampling of H. pylori stool antigen with known pure and stool-mixed bacterial amounts.

A numerical result for H. pylori stool antigen was correlated to the UBT delta for each patient using Pearson's r test. A Student t-test was then performed to investigate possible differences in UBT and H. pylori stool antigen test values between anti-CagA-positive and -negative patients. We obtained a saturation curve with both known quantities of pure and stool-mixed bacteria. Pearson's r test showed a significant correlation between the UBT delta value and H. pylori stool antigen measurement (r = 0.77; p < 0.001). Notably, the urea breath test delta and H. pylori stool antigen test values were significantly higher in anti-CagA-positive patients. Our data suggest that a numerical assessment of the H. pylori stool antigen test can provide valuable semiquantitative information on bacterial load and its correlation with UBT results.

### Qualitative and quantitative clinical evaluation of the laser-assisted ratio analyser for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection by (13)C-urea breath tests [^116Juv2i]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Currently, the (13)C-urea breath test is the reference method for non-invasive diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and therapy control. Therefore, new technologies have been developed to measure the ratio of (13)CO(2)/(12)CO(2) in breath. The laser-assisted ratio analyser (LARA) device is based on optogalvanic effects of the stimulated CO(2) molecules.

- **Design**: In this study, the LARA system is prospectively compared to conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis of (13)C-urea breath tests.

- **Methods**: The (13)C-urea breath test was used to screen 103 patients for H. pylori infection. Breath samples were analysed by LARA and IRMS techniques.

- **Results**: Seven breath tests could not be analysed by the LARA system, one by IRMS. Out of the remaining 95 breath tests, 13 were positive for H. pylori infection (13.7%). In reference to IRMS analysis (with a cut-off of > 5 delta per thousand at 30 min), LARA produced one false positive and one false negative breath test result, giving a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 98.8%. The mean difference in delta over baseline values between IRMS and LARA measurements was 2.02 delta per thousand ± 5.48 delta per thousand.

LARA allows the reliable qualitative evaluation of (13)C-urea breath tests, but the quantitative results differ from IRMS findings.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^1114MVkz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining testing for H. pylori infection with a non-serological test in patients with autoimmune gastritis, followed by eradication treatment if positive and post-treatment testing to confirm eradication.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: Noninvasive methods compared to invasive methods and evaluation of two new tests [^116T2P38]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommending Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment without performing endoscopy in certain patients highlight the importance of noninvasive tests. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of two new tests: the antigen stool test and Helicoblot 2.1 (an immunoblot used on serum), as well as the 13C urea breath test and ELISA serology, in comparison to invasive tests for the pretreatment diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed prospectively in 104 untreated patients using eight different tests. Invasive tests included culture, urease test (CLOtest), histology, and PCR. Noninvasive tests included the 13C urea breath test, IgG serology (Pyloriset EIA-G), immunoblot (Helicoblot 2.1), and antigen stool detection (Premier Platinum HpSA). A predefined gold standard based on biopsy tests was used to define H. pylori status, as well as an empirical approach.

There was no statistically significant difference between the different tests. The sensitivity of the noninvasive tests ranged between 88.9% and 95.6% (stool test: 88.9%, 95% CI: 82.7–95.1, and Helicoblot 2.1: 95.6%, 95% CI: 91.5–99.6), and the specificity ranged between 92.6% and 98.1% (stool test: 94.4%, 95% CI: 84.6–98.8, and Helicoblot 2.1: 92.6%, 95% CI: 91.5–96.2) when a predefined gold standard was used.

Most tests had sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values > 90%. The noninvasive tests are accurate for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Helicoblot 2.1 performed as well as the best ELISA kit. The HpSA is a promising test.

### Helicobacter pylori real-time quantitative PCR to examine efficacy of endoscope processing [^115HE8Yj]. American Journal of Infection Control (2025). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the main cause of peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopy and histology are confirmatory testing methods for H. pylori diagnosis. The primary aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of endoscope high-level disinfection (HLD) at clearing H. pylori. The secondary aim is to evaluate the prevalence of H. pylori in patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

- **Methods**: This is a prospective study performed in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit, collecting samples from EGD before and after HLD. The fluid obtained via gastric lavage and after HLD was tested for H. pylori. Patients' records were reviewed for H. pylori history and clinical testing. The fluid obtained via EGD was tested for microbiologic culture, urease testing, and qPCR testing using UreA primers and probe.

- **Results**: The study included 202 EGD samples (101 patients). The most common indications for EGD were reflux, GI bleed, and abdominal pain. A total of 37% of samples were positive by urease testing, followed by culture (12.9%) and biopsy (4.9%). H. pylori was four times more likely to be identified via gastric lavage than by biopsy. qPCR was significantly more likely to be negative after HLD (27 vs. 3 patients).

- **Conclusion**: HLD of EGD was effective in reducing H. pylori but was not able to completely eliminate H. pylori DNA. qPCR is more sensitive than routine culture but cannot differentiate live from dead pathogens and is unable to accurately determine the potential for infection transmission. Gastric lavage may be more effective in detecting H. pylori compared to biopsy methods.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116jqUr8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning the choice of diagnostic test, the ACG 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining a rapid urease test during endoscopy. This is considered an accurate and inexpensive means of identifying H. pylori infection in patients who have not taken a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 1–2 weeks or an antibiotic or bismuth within 4 weeks of endoscopy.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^112sHfyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Statement 13: For those with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following unsuccessful eradication attempts, there is no evidence-based guideline on appropriate follow-up. The IHPWG consensus is that endoscopic surveillance with ESGE-recommended mapping biopsies for precancerous changes should be considered at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed treatment.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: low.

Mainly due to poor patient compliance and the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, H. pylori treatment failure has become more common, leading to challenges in H. pylori management. Over decades, H. pylori gastritis may progress through a cascade of precancerous stages from intestinal metaplasia, followed by dysplasia and finally carcinoma. Evidence-based recommendations on the management of persistent H. pylori infection following multiple eradication attempts are lacking. While biomarkers for precancerous changes are under investigation, none can currently be recommended for routine clinical use.

The IHPWG consensus recommends endoscopic surveillance with the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy's management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach mapping biopsies for precancerous changes at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed H. pylori eradication attempt to monitor for signs of mucosal progression. Additionally, the development of new symptoms at any stage during follow-up, especially any alarm symptoms, should trigger further assessment.

### Posttreatment 13C-urea breath test is predictive of antimicrobial resistance to H. pylori after failed therapy [^115At1XN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We tested whether a 13C-urea breath test can predict the antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

- **Methods**: Seventy patients who had failed triple eradication therapy and 108 untreated H. pylori-infected patients were given a 13C-urea breath test, endoscopy for culture of H. pylori, and assessment of clarithromycin resistance. The patients who had failed triple therapy then received 1 week of quadruple therapy to eradicate residual H. pylori.

- **Results**: The posttreatment value of the 13C-urea breath test, expressed as excessive delta13CO2 per mL (ECR), was higher in patients with residual H. pylori with clarithromycin resistance than in those without (23.8 vs. 10.6; Por15 [93.8% vs. 73.3%; P.05]).

- **Conclusion**: The posttreatment value of the 13C-urea breath test is predictive of clarithromycin resistance in residual H. pylori after failed triple therapy and predicts the efficacy of the rescue regimen. The value of the noninvasive test is promising for primary care physicians who need to select a rescue regimen without.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114Ss8xW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

A corpus and antrum biopsy sample should be taken for the rapid urease test. A biopsy from the antrum and the corpus should be taken for the RUT to account for the patchy distribution of H. pylori, which can occur due to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Emerging evidence from abroad and from Ireland suggests that testing the antrum and corpus biopsies, either separately or combined within the same test, significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy of the RUT. Additionally, the combined approach reduces the reaction time of the test, resulting in a more rapid diagnosis.

Accumulating evidence also supports the reuse of RUT biopsy samples for DNA isolation and the diagnosis of H. pylori infection by molecular methods such as PCR. This eliminates the need to take additional biopsies specifically for PCR and provides the opportunity to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by analyzing the H. pylori DNA for resistance-associated mutations (see statement 6). Another advantage of molecular methods for the detection of H. pylori is that they are less affected by PPI use than other H. pylori detection methods. Studies evaluating the feasibility and accuracy of reusing rapid urease test biopsies for PCR-based H. pylori detection and antimicrobial sensitivity testing are warranted in the Irish healthcare setting.

### Comparison of three stool antigen tests for Helicobacter pylori detection [^114ctLpy]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Active Helicobacter pylori infection can be diagnosed by invasive (biopsy-based) or non-invasive methods, such as stool antigen testing.

- **Aims**: To compare three stool antigen enzyme immunoassay kits — Premier Platinum Hp SA, FemtoLab Cnx, and Hp Ag — with biopsy-based methods for the detection of H. pylori in previously undiagnosed patients.

- **Methods**: One hundred and eleven adults with dyspepsia referred for endoscopy provided a stool sample for testing and had biopsies taken. Patients were considered H. pylori positive if two out of three invasive tests were positive or if culture alone was positive.

- **Results**: The sensitivities and specificities of the Premier Platinum Hp SA, FemtoLab Cnx, and Hp Ag stool antigen kits when compared with biopsy-based diagnosis were 63.6%, 88.0%, and 56.0%, and 92.6%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: FemtoLab Cnx may be considered as an alternative to urea breath testing in the initial diagnosis of patients with dyspepsia who do not require immediate endoscopy. Stool testing has the potential advantages of being simple to perform, relatively cheap, and samples can be submitted directly from primary care.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^115jkK6F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

The ACG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining testing for Helicobacter pylori infection using a nonserological test in patients with autoimmune gastritis. If the test is positive, eradication treatment should be followed by post-treatment testing to confirm eradication.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112YRPmf]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

The global consensus meeting on H. pylori gastritis has set a new landmark for gastritis, which has continued to be an ill-conceived clinical entity placed between a histological picture and upper abdominal symptoms. In spite of the fact that gastritis had been long recognized as an important clinical entity, generations of gastroenterologists have neglected the importance of treatment of this nosological entity. Rudolf Schindler described chronic gastritis as a serious disease and a precursor of gastric cancer, considering their relationship to be of outstanding importance in the fight against gastric cancer.

The discovery of H. pylori has revolutionized the pre-existing concepts of gastritis by assigning a specific etiology to this entity underlying peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. The majority of these serious conditions are manifestations developed on the background of chronic gastritis caused by a unique infectious agent, H. pylori. For PUD, guidelines unanimously recommend eradication as the primary treatment for those with positive H. pylori tests. However, there has been no consensus on how and when to manage individuals with H. pylori gastritis itself, which is crucial to the efficiency of gastric cancer prevention because most patients with chronic gastritis may remain asymptomatic until the appearance of severe complications. Furthermore, both gastritis and duodenitis were recognized as important causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, encouraging our attention to these conditions now that anti-thrombotic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Accuracy of Helicobacter pylori diagnostic tests in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113h5Rx8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of the different tests aimed to detect Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

- **Selection of studies**: Assessing the accuracy of H. pylori diagnostic methods in patients with UGIB.

- **Search strategy**: Electronic bibliographical searches were conducted.

- **Data extraction**: This process was independently done by two reviewers.

- **Data synthesis**: Meta-analyses of the different tests were performed by combining the sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of the individual studies.

- **Results**:

Studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR− (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the different methods were as follows:

- **Rapid urease test (16 studies/1,417 patients)**: 0.67 (0.64–0.70), 0.93 (0.90–0.96), 9.6 (5.1–18.1), and 0.31 (0.22–0.44).
- **Histology (10 studies/827 patients)**: 0.70 (0.66–0.74), 0.90 (0.85–0.94), 6.7 (2.5–18.4), and 0.23 (0.12–0.46).
- **Culture (3 studies/314 patients)**: 0.45 (0.39–0.51), 0.98 (0.92–1.00), 19.6 (4–96), and 0.31 (0.05–1.9).
- **Urea breath test (8 studies/520 patients)**: 0.93 (0.90–0.95), 0.92 (0.87–0.96), 9.5 (3.9–23.3), and 0.11 (0.07–0.16).
- **Stool antigen test (6 studies/377 patients)**: 0.87 (0.82–0.91), 0.70 (0.62–0.78), 2.3 (1.4–4), and 0.2 (0.13–0.3).
- **Serology (9 studies/803 patients)**: 0.88 (0.85–0.90), 0.69 (0.62–0.75), 2.5 (1.6–4.1), and 0.25 (0.19–0.33).

In conclusion, biopsy-based methods such as the rapid urease test, histology, and culture have a low sensitivity but a high specificity in patients with UGIB.

### A new, practical, low-dose 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: clinical validation and comparison with the standard method [^111AiBwp]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

The carbon-14 urea breath test (UBT) is a reliable and non-invasive technique for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of a new, practical, low-dose (14)C-UBT system for diagnosing HP and compared the results with those obtained using the standard method.

Seventy-five patients (56 female, 19 male) with dyspepsia underwent (14)C-UBT and endoscopy with antral biopsies for histological analysis. The rapid urease test (CLO test) was applied to 50 of these patients. After a 6-hour fasting period, a 37-kBq (14)C-urea capsule was swallowed for UBT. Breath samples were collected and counted using two different methods, the Heliprobe method and the standard method.

- **Heliprobe method**: Patients exhaled into a special dry cartridge system (Heliprobe BreathCard) at 10 minutes. The activities of the cartridges were counted using a designated small GM counter system (Heliprobe analyser). Results were expressed both as counts per minute (HCPM) and as grade (0, not infected; 1, equivocal; 2, infected) based on the counts.

- **Standard method**: Breath samples were collected by trapping in a liquid CO(2) absorber. Radioactivity was counted as disintegrations per minute (SDPM) using a liquid scintillation counter after the addition of a liquid scintillation cocktail.

Histological examination was used as the gold standard. Two patients were excluded from the study because of inadequate biopsy sampling. Forty-eight patients (65%) were found to be HP positive on histology. The Heliprobe method correctly classified 48 of…

### Serology is more sensitive than urea breath test or stool antigen for the initial diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori gastritis when compared with histopathology [^111qzqmz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). High credibility.

To assess the concordance and performance characteristics of Helicobacter pylori laboratory tests compared with histopathology, algorithms for the diagnosis of H. pylori were proposed to minimize diagnostic error. H. pylori diagnostics from a 12-year period within a health system (2,560 cases) were reviewed. Analyses adjusted diagnostic performance based on treatment and consensus histopathologic diagnoses among pathologists. Markers of access to care, including test cancellation frequency and turnaround time, were assessed. Costs and performance of candidate noninvasive testing algorithms were modeled as a function of disease prevalence.

Serum H. pylori IgG demonstrated a higher sensitivity (0.94) than the urea breath and stool antigen tests (0.64 and 0.61, respectively). Evidence of an advantage in access to care for serology included a lower cancellation rate. Interobserver variability was higher (κ = 0.34) among pathologists for cases with a discordant laboratory test than concordant cases (κ = 0.56). A model testing algorithm utilizing serology for first-time diagnoses minimizes diagnostic error.

Although H. pylori serology has modestly lower specificity than other noninvasive tests, its superior sensitivity and negative predictive value support its use as a noninvasive test to rule out H. pylori infection. Reflexive testing with positive serology followed by either stool antigen or urea breath test may optimize diagnostic accuracy in low-prevalence populations.

### The (13)C-urea breath test for non-invasive diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: which procedure and which measuring equipment [^112gekT1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The (13)C-urea breath test is one of the most important non-invasive methods for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection in both pre- and post-treatment phases. In order to render the test less expensive and more rapid, a series of modifications have recently been proposed concerning the dose of (13)C-urea and its formulation, as well as the type of measuring equipment used for detecting (13)CO(2) in breath samples. The use of small doses (40–50 mg) of isotope in gelatin capsules or mixed with citric acid in rapid-releasing tablets seems promising, as it shortens sampling time to 10–20 minutes.

Infrared spectroscopy and laser-assisted ratio analysis equipment are two new valid and less expensive alternatives to conventional isotope mass spectrometry for (13)C analysis in breath. The (13)C-urea breath test is one of the most accurate non-invasive tests for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection. This method has become increasingly popular in the last decade because it employs an innocuous, non-radioactive isotope that can be safely used in both children and adults. The test has been recently simplified by reducing the dose of (13)C-urea used, adopting shorter sampling times, and using new and cheaper measuring methods for (13)C analysis in the breath samples. These include nondispersive isotope-selective infrared spectroscopy (NDIRS) and laser-assisted ratio analysis (LARA), which greatly differ from each other in their technical characteristics and cost. Both NDIRS and LARA are valid alternatives to conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).

### High accuracy of noninvasive tests to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection in very young children [^114qvoLJ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to validate the (13)C-urea-breath-test (UBT) and stool antigen test (HpSA) in children aged 5 years or younger, against invasive histologic study and rapid-urease-testing or culture.

In the study design, all consecutive children aged 5 years or younger undergoing endoscopy in a single center during the last 7.5 years were subjected to UBT and HpSA.

The results indicated that out of a total of 184 children (median age 2.2 years, range 0.2–5.5), 30 were Helicobacter pylori-positive (16.3%). Sensitivity and specificity of UBT were 93.3% (95% CI 77.9%-99.2%) and 95.5% (90.9%-98.2%), with a cutoff of 5 per thousand. However, specificity increased to 98.1% (94.4%-99.6%) with a cutoff of 8 per thousand. Sensitivity and specificity of HpSA were 93.3% (77.9%-99.2%) and 98.7% (95.4%-99.8%).

The conclusion drawn was that the accuracy of noninvasive tests in this single-center study was satisfactory. Specifically, the specificity of UBT improved with a cutoff at 8%, and the sensitivity of HpSA was high when determined locally without transportation after long or inadequate storage that could impair results.

### Effect of proton pump inhibitors on the continuous real time (13)c-urea breath test [^1135HfZu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new, continuous real-time (13)C-urea breath test, BreathID, for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients who tested positive for H. pylori by BreathID were prospectively evaluated. Patients were randomized to receive either omeprazole 20 mg/day or pantoprazole 40 mg/day for 14 days. A repeat breath test was conducted on day 14 when patients received their last PPI pill. Patients were administered a test drink containing 75 mg (13)C-urea and 4.0 g citric acid. Real-time, continuously sampled expired (13)CO(2), obtained within 6–20 minutes, was compared with the measurement of expired (13)CO(2) by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).

Results: A full set of test data was available for 43 patients. After 14 days of treatment with PPIs, false-negative detection of H. pylori occurred in only 1/43 (2.3%) patients examined by the continuous real-time (13)C-urea breath test compared to 2/43 (4.6%) patients examined by IRMS. With the exception of one case, complete agreement was observed between BreathID and the IRMS breath tests both at baseline and after PPI treatment. PPI treatment was associated with three different types of responses on the UBT:

- **Decrease in (13)CO(2)/(12)CO(2) excretion**: One-third of the patients developed a significant decrease.
- **Increase in post-PPI breath test results**: Roughly one-third of the patients developed a significant increase.
- **No significant change**: Results did not change significantly in the remaining patients.

Linear regression analysis was performed on 43 H. pylori-positive patients.

### Helicobacter pylori antigen stool test and 13C-urea breath test in patients after eradication treatments [^113zfXcR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend either the urea breath test (UBT) or the Helicobacter pylori antigen stool test (HpSA) for monitoring H. pylori infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between the two tests in patients after treatment.

After eradication treatments, patients were tested with both UBT and HpSA. Cut-off values for UBT were defined as positive (≥ 5 per thousand), indeterminate (3.01–4.99 per thousand), and negative (< 3.01 per thousand). For HpSA, cut-off values were positive (≥ 0.160), indeterminate (0.159–0.140), and negative (< 0.140). Patients with either discordant or indeterminate tests underwent repeat endoscopy with multiple gastric biopsies for rapid urease test (RUT), culture, histology, and immunohistochemistry to detect H. pylori and assess the ratio between coccoid and bacillary forms.

A total of 458 patients were studied. Of these, 422 (92.2%) had concordant tests, three (0.6%) indeterminate tests (one on UBT and two on HpSA), and 33 (7.2%) discordant tests. A total of 28 patients (25 with discordant and three with indeterminate tests) underwent endoscopy. The HpSA was inaccurate in 24 cases (18 false negative, four false positive, and two indeterminate results), whereas the UBT was inaccurate in four cases (two false positive, one false negative, and one indeterminate result). Biopsy-based tests showed no bacillary or coccoid forms in all five endoscoped patients who were negative on UBT and positive on HpSA.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114PPCuM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in symptomatic adults**:

	- All patients with symptoms related to the upper gastrointestinal tract should be tested for Helicobacter pylori. The recommendation is strong, and the quality of evidence is high. H. pylori eradication cures peptic ulcers in most patients whose ulcers are not associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and reduces gastric cancer risk. Moreover, eradication leads to the regression of most localized gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. European guidelines also recommend H. pylori eradication for patients with unexplained iron-deficient anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and vitamin B12 deficiency.

	- European guidelines have recommended the test-and-treat strategy for managing H. pylori by performing noninvasive testing of individuals with uninvestigated dyspepsia, followed by treatment in cases where H. pylori is detected. This strategy is recommended in younger dyspeptic patients (under 50 years), those of any age with alarm symptoms or a family history of gastric cancer, and for all patients where the test-and-treat strategy fails. H. pylori can be detected in biopsy samples taken during endoscopy.

### Comparison of three stool antigen assays with the 13C-urea breath test for the primary diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and monitoring treatment outcome [^116MLFEb]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The urea breath test (UBT) is the gold-standard non-invasive test for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the usefulness of this method is limited due to the high cost of the test and the need for expensive analytical instrumentation. Therefore, stool antigen assays may offer an alternative non-invasive method for diagnosing the infection.

- **Objective**: To compare the accuracy of three stool antigen assays (HpSA, IDEIA HpStAR, and ImmunoCard STAT) against the UBT for the primary diagnosis of H. pylori infection and for monitoring treatment outcome.

- **Methods**: A total of 102 patients attending two gastroenterology day-case clinics for the investigation of dyspepsia were included. Each patient provided breath and stool samples for analysis. Patients who tested positive for H. pylori by the validated UBT were prescribed triple therapy and invited to return for repeat breath and stool sample analysis 6 weeks post-treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 102 patients tested, 48 were diagnosed with H. pylori infection by the UBT. The HpSA assay interpreted 38 of these as positive (79% sensitive). Of the 54 UBT-negative patients, the HpSA assay interpreted all 54 as negative (100% specific). The IDEIA HpStAR assay correctly identified 44 patients as positive (92% sensitive) and 50 as negative (92.5% specific). The ImmunoCard STAT assay interpreted 38 patients as positive (79% sensitive) and 52 as negative (96.3% specific).

- **Conclusion**: The findings indicate that the IDEIA HpStAR stool antigen kit is the most accurate assay.

### Sensitivity of a novel stool antigen test for detection of Helicobacter pylori in adult outpatients before and after eradication therapy [^113D7tke]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated whether a novel monoclonal stool antigen test for the detection of Helicobacter pylori performs with the same accuracy as the (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) for adult outpatients in a private office setting. The two tests showed identical levels of sensitivity when used to identify H. pylori-infected patients both before and after eradication therapy.

### The usefulness of capsulated 13C-urea breath test in diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115DDHyv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

H. pylori infection and peptic ulcerations, along with their complications such as bleeding, are causally related, but the available methods for confirming active H. pylori during bleeding lack accuracy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) in diagnosing H. pylori infection in bleeding patients.

- **Patients and methods**: Eighty-one patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 258 matched controls without bleeding were enrolled in the study. UBT was performed using low-dose capsulated 13C-urea and IgG antibodies to H. pylori were determined by ELISA.

- **Results**: UBT performed in bleeding patients was positive in 77.7% of cases. In this group, anti-Hp IgG was positive in 79% of cases, and gastroscopy revealed 40.7% of bleeding duodenal ulcers, 38% bleeding gastric ulcers, and 86% hemorrhagic gastritis. UBT was positive in 90.9%, 77.4%, and 52.97% of cases, respectively, and these results were not statistically different from those in non-bleeding controls with duodenal and gastric ulcers and gastritis. All patients with blood or "coffee grounds" in the stomach had both UBT and serology positive.

- **Conclusion**: The UBT is a simple and non-invasive method, which can be successfully applied in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding to detect active H. pylori infection prior to emergency endoscopy.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115VwXCF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Statement 5**: If Helicobacter pylori cultures are required, a corpus and an antrum biopsy should be taken.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

The culture of H. pylori from biopsy specimens enables diagnosis and provides the opportunity for AST. While culture is very specific, it is time-consuming and requires expertise in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Culture success rates range from as low as 55% to as high as 93%. Culture success is influenced by PPI use, the biopsy collection medium, sample transport conditions, and contamination of the samples with other microorganisms. Dedicated biopsies should be taken from both the antrum and the corpus to increase culture success.

This recommendation has been supported locally by a study carried out at Tallaght University Hospital, showing that H. pylori was successfully cultured in a significantly higher number of cases when combined antrum and corpus biopsy sampling was used compared with a single antrum biopsy [64.4% (n = 94/146) vs. 49.3% (36/73); P = 0.04]. In support of a combined biopsy protocol, differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of H. pylori isolated from the corpus compared with the antrum have been reported. Thus, sampling from both sites avoids resistant H. pylori being missed by the collection of only a single sample from one site of the stomach.

To prevent contact with air and desiccation, biopsy specimens for culture should be transported in leak-proof containers containing a dedicated transport medium (e.g. Portagerm pylori, bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France).

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^116jdxYQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Statement 7: The 13C-urea breath test (UBT) is the preferred noninvasive method for diagnosing H. pylori in the Greek population.

- **Recommendation grade**: B; **Evidence level**: 2b; **Agreement level**: 100%

Non-invasive methods include the stool antigen test (SAT), serology, and UBT. SAT detects H. pylori antigens in stool samples with a sensitivity and specificity of up to 95%; however, sample storage and transport may impair the test's sensitivity. Furthermore, considering the unwillingness of patients in Greece to collect stool samples for testing, SAT is not the preferred method for adults.

Serologic tests detect anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies with variable sensitivity and specificity among different manufacturers. Positive IgG serology indicates a past infection, but not necessarily an ongoing one. The "cutoff" values of the serologic tests should be carefully determined in the local population before their widespread use.

UBT requires ingesting a solution with urea labeled with either radioactive 14C or non-radioactive 13C. This is followed by detecting isotope-labeled carbon dioxide in a sample of exhaled breath. A positive result indicates the presence of H. pylori bacteria. The test is well-tolerated, easy to perform, and has high diagnostic accuracy, with reported sensitivities and specificities greater than 90% in a recent meta-analysis.

The 13C UBT has higher diagnostic accuracy compared to serology and SATs; therefore, it is the recommended method for the non-endoscopic diagnosis of H. pylori infection in the Greek population.

### Evolving concepts in Helicobacter pylori management [^115mknV7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection worldwide and the most significant risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. H. pylori and gastric cancer continue to disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority and immigrant groups in the United States. The approach to H. pylori case-finding thus far has relied on opportunistic testing based on symptoms or high-risk indicators, such as racial or ethnic background and family history. However, this approach misses a substantial proportion of individuals infected with H. pylori who remain at risk for gastric cancer because most infections remain clinically silent.

Moreover, individuals with chronic H. pylori infection are at risk for gastric preneoplastic lesions, which are also asymptomatic and only reliably diagnosed using endoscopy and biopsy. Thus, to make a significant impact in gastric cancer prevention, a systematic approach is needed to better identify individuals at highest risk of both H. pylori infection and its complications, including gastric preneoplasia and cancer. The approach to H. pylori eradication must also be optimized given sharply decreasing rates of successful eradication with commonly used therapies and increasing antimicrobial resistance.

With growing acceptance that H. pylori should be managed as an infectious disease and the increasing availability of susceptibility testing, we now have the momentum to abandon empirical therapies demonstrated to have inadequate eradication rates. Molecular-based susceptibility profiling facilitates more targeted and effective treatment strategies.

### Histological examination of ulcer margin for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers [^1156GirJ]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Biopsy of the ulcer margin is routinely performed to exclude malignancy in patients with gastric ulcers; however, its utility in diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection has not yet been fully studied. A cohort of 50 patients with gastric ulcers was prospectively examined. Three tests, including histology, rapid urease test, and urea breath test, were performed in all patients to diagnose H. pylori infection. Six biopsied specimens from the margin of the gastric ulcer and one specimen each from the antrum and body of the non-ulcer part were obtained for histology using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain. The criterion for defining H. pylori infection was a positive result in at least two of the three tests. H. pylori infection was diagnosed in 27 (54%) of the patients.

The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the histological examination of the ulcer margin were 92.6%, 95.7%, 96.2%, 91.7%, and 94%, respectively. The addition of one specimen from the antrum or body, or a combination of the two specimens, did not increase the diagnostic yields of the histological examination of the ulcer margin alone. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for the rapid urease test were 96.3%, 100%, 100%, 95.8%, and 98% respectively, and the corresponding values for the urea breath test were 88.9%, 87%, 88.9%, 87%, and 88% respectively.

We performed Giemsa stain for the three patients with false-negative and false-positive results of the histological examination of the ulcer margin using H&E stain, and all were accurately diagnosed with this method.

### Evaluation of a new biopsy urease test: Pronto Dry, for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112XyUg7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

The gastric biopsy urease test is the most frequently used method for diagnosing *Helicobacter pylori* infection in routine gastrointestinal endoscopy practice. In Malaysia, until recently, only one commercial biopsy urease test was available: the CLO test (Ballard Medical Products, Draper, Utah, USA). Large endoscopy units often use their own 'homemade' unbuffered ultra-rapid urease test for the diagnosis of *H. pylori* infection.

- **Objective**: To compare the accuracy and reaction time of a new biopsy urease test, Pronto Dry (Medical Instruments Corporation, Solothurn, Switzerland), and the CLO test in diagnosing *H. pylori* infection.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients presenting with dyspepsia to the endoscopy unit at the University of Malaya Medical Centre were recruited for the study. Patients who were previously treated for *H. pylori* infection or who had received antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or bismuth compounds in the preceding four weeks were excluded. *H. pylori* diagnosis was based on the ultra-rapid urease test and histological examination of gastric biopsies. Four antral and four corpus biopsies were taken for this purpose from all patients. A diagnosis of *H. pylori* infection was made when both the ultra-rapid urease test and histology were positive in either the antral or corpus biopsies. A negative diagnosis of *H. pylori* was made when both tests from antral and corpus biopsies were all negative. Another four antral and four corpus biopsies (two each) were taken for the Pronto Dry and CLO tests. The Pronto Dry and CLO tests were stored and performed according to standard procedures.

### A test-and-treat policy does not save endoscopy workload in a non-referral hospital [^1175uEUt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of a test-and-treat policy with open-access urea breath testing (UBT) on referral rates for endoscopy in a district hospital, and examine any changes in the proportion of serious pathology detected endoscopically after adopting the policy, we conducted a study.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data on all open-access endoscopy referrals in a 12-month period before (October 1994 to September 1995) and two years after (October 1997 to September 1998) the introduction of the UBT service. This was compared with the same service in our sister hospital, which did not provide a UBT service. Results of patients attending the UBT service during the study period were also examined.

- **Results**: A total of 798 patients attended for endoscopy (18% aged 40 years or older) in the pre-UBT year, compared with 1905 patients (16% aged 40 years or older) in the post-UBT year. The standardized referral ratios were significantly higher for both age groups in the post-UBT year: 210 in the 40 years or older group (95% CI 233 to 257). Six percent of the 40 years or older group (P < 0.01). The total number of open-access endoscopies had increased steadily over the three years, despite the introduction of the UBT service. This trend was mirrored in our sister hospital. A total of 457 patients attended the UBT service during the 12 months of the study.

### Diagnostic performance of urea breath test, rapid urea test, and histology for Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with partial gastrectomy: a meta-analysis [^115z8uKn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulceration and particularly residual stomach cancer in the postoperative stomach.

The aim of this study was to determine the performance of different commonly used tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients after partial gastrectomy.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect databases with relevant keywords. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the performance of the different tests, including sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios (LRs), diagnostic odds ratios, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. The meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc software.

- **Results**: Studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, and diagnostic odds ratio for the different methods were as follows:

- **Urea breath test (9 studies)**: Sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72–0.82), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85–0.93), LR+ of 6.32 (95% CI, 3.22–12.42), LR- of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17–0.43), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 27.86 (95% CI, 13.27–58.49).

- **Rapid urease test (7 studies)**: Sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84), specificity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90–0.97), LR+ of 10.21 (95% CI, 5.94–17.54), LR- of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.22–0.36), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 49.02 (95% CI, 24.24–99.14).

### Initial treatment with lansoprazole in young dyspeptic patients with negative urea breath test result: a randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up [^115hvdyr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Although empirical antisecretory drug therapy is recommended for young dyspeptic patients without alarming features, the effectiveness of this approach remains undetermined. We evaluated the long-term effects of an initial 12-week course of lansoprazole in young dyspeptic patients without Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.

- **Methods**: Patients who were less than 45 years old and presented with at least 3 months of dyspepsia in the absence of alarming features were eligible. They were offered a¹³C-urea breath test (UBT) to determine H. pylori status; all symptomatic patients with a negative UBT were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Those who had previous endoscopy or positive UBT were excluded. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as worsening of global dyspeptic symptoms while on study medication. Patients were followed up for 26 weeks for global dyspeptic symptoms, as determined by a 7-point Likert scale. Quality-of-life assessment (SF-36), the need for endoscopy, and utilization of other health-care services were monitored for 52 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 157 dyspeptic patients were randomized. At the end of the 12-week treatment, the proportion of patients with treatment failure was similar in the lansoprazole (33.3%) and placebo (30.3%) groups (P = 0.74). Patients' global assessment of their dyspeptic symptoms was comparable at all time points measured. There was also no significant difference in the SF-36 mental and physical summary scales. At the end of 52 weeks, there was no difference in the proportion…

### Real-time gastric juice analysis with EndoFaster for H. pylori diagnosis: a large, multicentre study [^113BtS6t]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of the most frequent gastroduodenal diseases. Because its prevalence is decreasing in developed countries, gastric biopsies are negative in several patients. By measuring ammonium in the gastric juice, EndoFaster allows exclusion of H. pylori infection during endoscopy. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of device versions working with either 6 mL or 3 mL of gastric juice.

- **Study design**: This prospective study involved 12 endoscopic units. During endoscopy, EndoFaster testing was performed, and standard five gastric biopsies were taken. The accuracy was calculated by considering histological assessment as the gold standard for H. pylori diagnosis.

- **Results**: Gastric juice analysis was attempted in 1,279 patients, but it failed in 131 (15.5%) and in 10 (2.3%) with the 6 mL and the 3 mL device, respectively (P < 0.001). Overall, EndoFaster detected H. pylori infection with an 86.3% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, 52.7% positive predictive value, 96.6% negative predictive value, and 83.8% accuracy. The performance was not affected by ongoing proton pump inhibitor therapy or a previous H. pylori eradication. No significant difference in accuracy emerged between the two versions of the device.

- **Conclusion**: The novel version of the EndoFaster device operating with 3 mL gastric juice may be performed in virtually all patients, and it allows exclusion of H. pylori infection with very high accuracy. Gastric biopsies can be avoided in a definite portion of cases without endoscopic lesions or other clinical indications.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^111iiweC]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the cause of most peptic ulcer disease and a primary risk factor for gastric cancer. Eradication of the organism results in ulcer healing and reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications. Testing and treatment have no clear value in patients with documented nonulcer dyspepsia; however, a test-and-treat strategy is recommended for patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia who have not undergone endoscopy. In the office setting, initial serology testing is practical and affordable, with endoscopy reserved for patients with alarm symptoms for ulcer complications or cancer, or those who do not respond to treatment. Treatment involves 10- to 14-day multidrug regimens including antibiotics and acid suppressants, combined with education about avoidance of other ulcer-causing factors and the need for close follow-up. Follow-up testing (i.e. urea breath or stool antigen test) is recommended for patients who do not respond to therapy or those with a history of ulcer complications or cancer.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^1175pAKJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The urea breath test (UBT) is the recommended noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative noninvasive test if locally validated. The recommendation is strong, with a high quality of evidence.

For the UBT, the patient ingests a solution containing 13 C-labelled (or less commonly 14 C-labelled) urea. The urease enzyme produced by H. pylori in infected patients converts the labelled urea to ammonia and labelled carbon dioxide, which is detected in a breath sample. Bacterial antigens are present in the stool of individuals with active H. pylori infection. The stool antigen test is an immunoassay that detects these antigens in stool samples. Serological testing can detect IgG antibodies to H. pylori in the blood.

As the UBT is considered the most accurate noninvasive test for H. pylori, with high sensitivity and specificity values, it is the recommended noninvasive test in the Irish healthcare setting. European guidelines recommend citric acid as the test meal because it slows gastric emptying and increases the distribution of the substrate and the contact time with H. pylori urease. It is recommended that patients fast in advance of the UBT.

For stool antigen testing, potential options include laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays and, more recently, rapid immunochromatography-based tests for point-of-care diagnosis. In relation to laboratory-based tests, mAb-based assays are superior to polyclonal-based tests.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^115QeLvf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

When an endoscopy is performed, the rapid urease test (RUT) should be preferred as the first diagnostic test for H. pylori detection. Two biopsies should be taken, one from the antrum and one from the corpus. A positive test permits the immediate initiation of treatment.

- **Recommendation grade**: B
- **Evidence level**: 2b
- **Agreement level**: 86%

Interventional methods for H. pylori diagnosis require biopsies taken during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy when indicated. The invasive methods for H. pylori diagnosis include RUT, histology, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To increase the sensitivity and reduce the time to positivity of RUT, it is preferred to place two biopsies into the reactive medium: one from the antrum and one from the corpus.

Biopsies should be taken from normal-appearing mucosa, avoiding areas of ulceration and obvious intestinal metaplasia (IM), where H. pylori is scarce or absent. The recent use of antibiotics and/or bismuth compounds (within four weeks) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (within two weeks) can increase the rate of false-negative results. Recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding also reduces RUT sensitivity. False positives due to other urease-containing organisms, such as Proteus spp., are extremely rare, except in cases of hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria. Although a negative RUT does not exclude the presence of H. pylori, a positive test allows for immediate treatment initiation.

### Kyoto global consensus report on helicobacter pylori gastritis [^114mFbpG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

There has been significant technical progress in diagnostic tools for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Advanced endoscopy with image-enhanced modalities and magnification allows for the diagnosis of gastritis with a high degree of accuracy even before histological confirmation. Furthermore, non-invasive diagnostic tests, such as the [13 C]-urea breath test, fecal antigen test, and serological parameters, serve as surrogate markers of H. pylori gastritis and indicators of gastritis severity. Classification systems for grading gastritis, such as the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM), have also been proposed in addition to the internationally accepted Sydney System, and their utility needs to be evaluated and agreed upon.

In 2013, the Japanese government insurance policy approved eradication therapy for H. pylori-positive gastritis after endoscopic examination to exclude more serious diseases such as ulcers and cancer, in line with the Japanese guidelines for H. pylori management. However, no global consensus has been published on when to recommend eradication therapy for H. pylori gastritis and how to follow up after eradication.

Since the global awareness of gastritis is still confounded by a number of controversial issues, as described above, a meeting was set up in Kyoto to achieve a global consensus on H. pylori gastritis. The meeting aimed to attempt conceptual changes in gastritis classification in general and to agree on diagnosis and management strategies with special reference to functional dyspepsia (FD) and cancer prevention.

### Low adherence to society guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori among pediatric gastroenterologists [^113RLjG1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

The revised ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2016 guideline on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection discourages a "test and treat" strategy. Instead, upper endoscopy (EGD) is recommended when a valid clinical indication is present. Likewise, new treatment recommendations for first-line therapies strongly encourage obtaining antimicrobial susceptibility before treatment. We conducted this study to assess the effect of revised guidelines on clinical practice at our center.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of patients with H pylori infection diagnosis either by serology, stool antigen test, urea breath test, or EGD at Boston Children's Hospital between January 2013 and July 2019. We compared demographic and clinical data between the initial guideline and 2016 revision (January 2013 to November 2016) and the period after the revised guideline (December 2016 to July 2019).

- **Results**: Two hundred and fifty-six patients were included. EGD was the initial diagnostic test in 49% (50/103, prerevised guideline) and in 52% (79/153, postrevised guideline). Biopsy culture was sent in 3% of patients for both periods (3/103 and 4/153, respectively). PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin triple therapy was the most common regimen in both periods. Clarithromycin use was lower in the postrevised guideline period (P = 0.003) whereas the opposite was noted for metronidazole and tetracycline (P = 0.009 and P = 0.02, respectively). There was no significant difference in eradication rate between periods (86% vs 81%).

- **Conclusions**: Low adherence to the updated H pylori guideline recommendations was observed.

### Comparison of accuracy between C- and C-urea breath testing: Is an indeterminate-results category still needed [^112cY8y2]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the leading cause of peptic ulcer disease. The purpose of this study was to assess both the difference in the distribution of negative versus positive results between the older 14C-urea breath test and the newer 13C-urea breath test, and to determine whether the use of an indeterminate-results category is still meaningful and what type of results should trigger repeated testing.

Methods: A retrospective survey was performed on all consecutive patients referred to our service for urea breath testing. We analyzed 562 patients who had undergone testing with 14C-urea and 454 patients who had undergone testing with 13C-urea.

Results: In comparison with the wide distribution of negative 14C results, negative 13C results were distributed farther from the cutoff and were more tightly grouped around the mean negative value. Distribution analysis of the negative results for 13C testing, compared with those for 14C testing, revealed a statistically significant difference between the two. Within the 13C group, only one patient could have been classified as having indeterminate results using the same indeterminate zone as used for the 14C group. This is significantly less frequent than what was found for the 14C group.

Borderline-negative results do occur with 13C-urea breath testing, although less frequently than with 14C-urea breath testing, and we will be carefully monitoring differences falling between 3.0 and 3.5%Δ. The 13C-urea breath testing is safe and simple for the patient and, in most cases, provides clearer positive and negative results.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori: A reappraisal [^116nSh6V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Despite many changes, no large studies comparing the different diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori have been performed in the past 10 years. During this time, monoclonal stool antigen immunoassays and in-office 13C-urea breath tests (UBTs) have emerged. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of invasive and noninvasive tests in a large series of dyspeptic patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 199 dyspeptic patients who had not previously been treated for H. pylori infection were prospectively enrolled. Noninvasive analyses included a commercial infrared-based UBT and a commercially available stool test. Biopsy-based tests included histological examination and a rapid urease test. A patient was considered to be infected when at least two test results were positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The test results were compared using the McNemar test.

- **Results**: Rates of positive test results were similar (54%) for the rapid urease test, histopathological examination, and the stool test. By contrast, 75% of UBT results were positive, and the UBT was associated with very low specificity (60%). For this reason, the delta cutoff value for the UBT was recalculated as 8.5%. Sensitivities and specificities with this new cutoff value were 95% and 100%, respectively, for the rapid urease test; 94% and 99%, respectively, for histopathological examination; 90% and 93%, respectively, for the stool test; and 90% and 90%, respectively, for the UBT.

- **Conclusions**: Histological examination and… (The text appears cut off and concludes here.)

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^117KnGjN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease that leads to chronic active gastritis of varying severity in virtually all infected subjects. There is significant variability in the interindividual expressions of gastric mucosal structural damage; accordingly, the associated physiological perturbations also vary. H. pylori gastritis may remain clinically unapparent or evolve into severe complications, with an unpredictable rate of progression. The most severe clinical expression is gastric cancer, which is often incurable by the time of diagnosis.

Cure of H. pylori infection leads to healing of the inflamed gastric mucosa, which may return to normal. Eradication of H. pylori may improve or resolve dyspeptic symptoms and usually cures peptic ulcer disease (PUD). H. pylori gastritis is a curable disease, thus preventing severe complications. However, if H. pylori gastritis has progressed to more severe forms of gastritis, such as atrophic gastritis (with or without intestinal metaplasia) or severe corpus-predominant gastritis, the risk of gastric cancer is increased. In such cases, eradication of the infection needs to be integrated with a follow-up strategy.

- **Dyspepsia associated with H. pylori infection**: H. pylori gastritis is the cause of dyspepsia in a subset of patients. The grade of recommendation is strong with a high evidence level, and there is 100% consensus on this statement.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori: improving the sensitivity of CLOtest by increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies [^112Pm5yo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The rapid urease CLOtest is commonly used during endoscopy to diagnose the presence of Helicobacter pylori. The aim of this study was to determine whether the sensitivity of the CLOtest can be improved by increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies from one to four.

- **Methods**: The study included 100 adult patients who were referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and tested positive for H. pylori infection on C urea breath test (considered the "gold standard"). These patients were randomly divided into four equal groups (groups 1 to 4) and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients in group 1 had one gastric antral biopsy during endoscopy, whereas those in groups 2, 3, and 4 had two, three, and four biopsies, respectively. The biopsies were placed in the rapid urease CLOtests, which were incubated at room temperature for up to 24 hours and read for positive results at 1, 6, and 24 hours.

- **Results**: About half of the patients (52%) had a positive CLOtest in group 1, compared to 68% in group 2, 76% in group 3, and 96% in group 4 (group 1 vs. 4, P < 0.01). After one hour of incubation, 96% of the patients in group 4 had a positive CLOtest, compared to 40% in group 3, 12% in group 2, and 4% in group 1.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies from one to four significantly improves the sensitivity of the CLOtest, eliminates sampling error, and hastens the time needed by the test to become positive for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114pRzfP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

A combination of histology, taken from the antrum and corpus, and a rapid urease test is recommended for invasive Helicobacter pylori testing. The recommendation is strong, with high quality of evidence.

While histological examination of biopsy samples requires highly trained personnel, it allows for the accurate detection of bacteria, staging of gastritis, and examination of focal lesions. To account for the patchy distribution of H. pylori, histological sampling should include two antrum biopsies (2–3 cm in front of the pylorus) and two corpus biopsies, which should be submitted in separate containers. Antral biopsies should be taken even if the mucosa appears healthy. An additional biopsy from the incisura is taken for gastritis histological staging when the OLGA (operative link on gastric atrophy) and OLGIM (operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia) protocols are followed. Any focal lesions should be sampled. Histochemical staining of the biopsy samples with hematoxylin and eosin or Giemsa identifies most cases of H. pylori. Immunohistochemical staining is recommended in cases of chronic active gastritis where H. pylori has not been detected by histochemistry alone, but in cases of normal histology, immunohistochemical staining is not required.

The rapid urease test (RUT) is easy to perform, enables a quick diagnosis, and allows for the immediate prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy. Stomach biopsies are placed into a urea-containing medium within the well of a slide. If H. pylori is present within the tissue sample, the bacterial urease will break down the urea to generate a visible reaction.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management of infections [^111Zk8i3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The treatment of H. pylori requires evidence of an active infection and therefore excludes serology, which cannot distinguish between an active infection and a serologic scar of past infections. Tests for active infection include urea breath tests, stool antigen tests, histology with (immune)-staining for the bacteria, culture, and molecular tests to identify H. pylori DNA in biological specimens such as stools or gastric biopsies.

The availability of susceptibility testing has resulted in the initial test needing to address whether the patient is infected and, if so, what the antibiotic susceptibility pattern is. Until recently, obtaining susceptibility testing required both endoscopies to obtain gastric mucosa biopsies and a laboratory willing to provide culture and susceptibility testing. While gastroenterologists were prepared to perform the required endoscopy and collect specimens, few laboratories offered culture and susceptibility testing.

In the last year, this has changed in the United States, as most major diagnostic laboratories now offer H. pylori culture and susceptibility testing. Although the availability of culture and susceptibility testing has provided a partial solution, it did not change the requirement for endoscopy. Obtaining and processing gastric biopsies is both time-consuming and expensive, and when specimens for culture must be shipped to distant locations, positive results are obtained in far fewer than 100% of cases. However, practical, rapid, less expensive, and noninvasive methods are being developed to address these challenges.

### An explainable artificial intelligence system for diagnosing infection under endoscopy: A case-control study [^111jviBi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Methods: Patients and esophagogastroduodenoscopy protocol**: We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with gastric biopsies or H. pylori breath test at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) between June 2020 and July 2021. We included 1,826 patients (881 H. pylori positive and 945 H. pylori negative) for the development of EADHI. Exclusion criteria include (1) patients with a history of GC, peptic ulcer, gastric surgery, or submucosal tumor and (2) patients who received H. pylori eradication or administered antibiotics within a month or proton pump inhibitor within two weeks of H. pylori breath test.

EGD was performed using a standard endoscope (GIF-HQ290, GIF-H260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; EG-L590ZW; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and the images were captured during high-definition, white-light examination of the antrum, angularis (retroflex), body (forward and retroflex), and fundus (retroflex).

### The most important diagnostic modalities for Helicobacter pylori, now and in the future [^113dDnyM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic methods**: Helicobacter pylori infection plays a central role in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disease. Its accurate diagnosis and successful eradication are crucial in various circumstances. Currently, serology is recommended for initial screening, followed by histology and/or culture to confirm the diagnosis before treatment. Since H. pylori is developing greater resistance to certain antibiotics, culture is becoming increasingly important in some populations to test for susceptibility to antibiotics. To confirm eradication after treatment, the urea breath test is used. This test is presently the best non-invasive test to determine eradication.

- **New approaches**: Considerable efforts are being made to improve diagnostic methods, and a host of new or improved approaches can be expected in the near future. For general screening, tests are being developed that use whole blood and can be used by general practitioners to give rapid results in a cost-effective manner. The evidence so far suggests that these new 'office' tests are not as accurate as laboratory tests, but they are nevertheless important for general diagnostic purposes. Serological tests for cagA antibodies and immunoblot tests are also under development. New biopsy-based tests include the development of a true rapid urease test which will give accurate results in 1 hour. Polymerase chain reaction/DNA enzyme immunoassay detection is another field receiving attention. Non-invasive direct tests of the future are likely to include the use of the polymerase chain reaction in f
