## Question

Role of aspirin to prevent stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of aspirin in stroke prevention, specifically distinguishing between primary and secondary prevention, and considering aspects such as mechanism, dosing, special populations, and guideline-based decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic basis of aspirin's antiplatelet effects. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for secondary prevention and the optimal dosing. Next, I will examine the evolving and controversial evidence for primary prevention, including contemporary trials and meta-analyses. After that, I should review guideline positions and risk-stratification tools. Finally, I will consider special populations, bleeding risk, and practical prescribing pearls, and close with a concise clinical bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1, suppressing thromboxane A2 and thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation, which is central to preventing atherothrombotic events including ischemic stroke, while simultaneously increasing bleeding risk, especially gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, which frames the entire risk–benefit calculus in primary prevention settings [^114b5ED1] [^114ecFa4].

> Now, I should review secondary prevention, where the evidence is strongest. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that aspirin reduces recurrent ischemic stroke and vascular death after TIA or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke by roughly 20–25%, with the most pronounced early benefit in the first days to weeks after the index event, supporting prompt initiation and long-term continuation of single antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated [^111oBoek] [^1138fSMF] [^1165gxwv]. Wait, let me verify the dosing nuance: while some older trials used 160–325 mg acutely, contemporary practice favors 75–100 mg daily for long-term secondary prevention, balancing efficacy and bleeding risk, and guidelines endorse a range of 81–325 mg for antiplatelet therapy in this context [^113tY3WP] [^113iwHky].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about primary prevention. Historically, older trials suggested modest reductions in composite cardiovascular events, but the absolute benefit for stroke was small and inconsistent, and bleeding hazards were nontrivial, which already hinted at a narrow net benefit window in low-risk populations [^111oBoek] [^112id9hc]. I should double-check contemporary data: three large modern trials (ARRIVE, ASCEND, ASPREE) and subsequent meta-analyses show little to no reduction in major cardiovascular events or stroke, with consistent increases in major bleeding and, in some analyses, intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in older adults, shifting the balance toward harm in many primary prevention scenarios [^116abzZB] [^116hjCXJ] [^1167CoXX] [^115JFuP5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The USPSTF 2022 recommends that adults aged 40–59 years with a 10-year CVD risk ≥ 10% may consider low-dose aspirin after shared decision-making, but advises against initiating aspirin for primary prevention in adults ≥ 60 years due to bleeding risk outweighing benefit. The AHA/ASA 2024 primary stroke prevention guideline similarly recommends against aspirin for adults ≥ 70 years and states evidence is insufficient for many other primary prevention contexts, including diabetes without prior stroke, CKD, and silent cerebrovascular disease [^114ecFa4] [^111wnEey] [^117RHvur] [^1165V1aG] [^1172NJxK] [^113VxEnY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the AHA/ASA might endorse routine primary prevention aspirin in diabetes, but I should correct that: the 2024 guideline explicitly states insufficient evidence for aspirin to prevent a first stroke in patients with diabetes or other common vascular risk factors without prior stroke, reinforcing a conservative stance [^113zE3JD].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and bleeding risk factors. In atrial fibrillation, aspirin is inferior to oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention and should not be used as a substitute. In intracranial atherosclerotic disease, aspirin remains foundational, and in select patients with recent severe intracranial stenosis, short-term dual antiplatelet therapy may be considered, though bleeding risk must be weighed carefully. In older adults, the ASPREE analysis shows no stroke prevention benefit and increased intracranial bleeding with low-dose aspirin, supporting avoidance of primary prevention aspirin in those ≥ 70 years [^113su7Tg] [^114KmBAE] [^115JFuP5]. But wait, what if the patient is already on aspirin at the time of a new ischemic event? The benefit of simply increasing the aspirin dose or switching agents is uncertain, so I should avoid reflexively changing therapy without a clear indication or trial-supported strategy [^115FNyMg].

> Let me consider dosing pragmatics and reconcile any discrepancies. For secondary prevention, 75–100 mg daily is reasonable for most patients, with guideline-endorsed flexibility up to 325 mg in specific contexts; for acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, early initiation in the 160–325 mg range within 48 hours is supported by trials, followed by transition to a maintenance dose; for primary prevention, if used at all in carefully selected 40–59-year-olds at ≥ 10% 10-year risk, 81 mg daily is the common U.S. dose, though the net benefit remains small and must be individualized [^113tY3WP] [^114VYyPB] [^114ecFa4] [^114DBJ9A]. Hold on, I should verify that higher maintenance doses do not improve efficacy in secondary stroke prevention; indeed, evidence does not show superiority of higher chronic doses and may increase bleeding, supporting the lowest effective dose approach [^113tY3WP].

> I should confirm the role of dual antiplatelet therapy to avoid overgeneralization. Short-course DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel for about 21–90 days) after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA reduces early recurrent stroke at the cost of more bleeding and is guideline-supported in selected patients, but prolonged DAPT beyond three months is not routinely recommended for secondary stroke prevention outside specific intracranial stenosis scenarios, and triple therapy should be avoided [^114KmBAE] [^116c2hck] [^115zv25U]. Let me reconsider whether any primary prevention DAPT indication exists; current guidance does not endorse DAPT for primary stroke prevention, reinforcing that DAPT is an acute-phase or high-risk secondary prevention strategy rather than a primary prevention tool [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize risk–benefit decisions in primary prevention. Shared decision-making is essential, incorporating 10-year CVD risk calculators, explicit bleeding risk assessment, and patient preferences; in adults ≥ 60, the harm from bleeding generally outweighs any small ischemic benefit, and in adults 40–59 at ≥ 10% risk, the absolute benefit is modest and must be weighed against gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding risks, with particular caution in those with peptic ulcer disease, concurrent anticoagulants or NSAIDs, liver disease, or uncontrolled hypertension [^114ecFa4] [^114DBJ9A]. I should double-check that contemporary meta-analyses align with this framing; they consistently show increased major bleeding and, in some analyses, increased hemorrhagic stroke without mortality benefit, supporting a conservative approach to primary prevention aspirin [^116hjCXJ] [^1167CoXX].

> Finally, I will synthesize the clinical bottom line. Aspirin is unequivocally indicated for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, with early initiation and long-term single antiplatelet therapy providing substantial reductions in recurrent stroke and vascular death; in contrast, routine aspirin for primary prevention is no longer broadly recommended, with potential small net benefit only in carefully selected adults aged 40–59 years at ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk after shared decision-making, and should be avoided in adults ≥ 60 years and in those with elevated bleeding risk or conditions like CKD, where harm likely outweighs benefit [^111oBoek] [^1138fSMF] [^114ecFa4] [^1172NJxK]. I need to ensure the practical takeaway is clear: prioritize risk factor optimization and lifestyle, reserve primary prevention aspirin for rare, well-selected cases, and never substitute aspirin for oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic settings [^113su7Tg].

Aspirin is indicated for **secondary prevention** of ischemic stroke and TIA [^112PpSbE], reducing recurrent stroke by ~13% and vascular death by ~15% [^1138fSMF]. For **primary prevention**, aspirin is not routinely recommended due to modest cardiovascular benefit and increased bleeding risk [^112E294o]; consider only in select adults 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk after shared decision-making [^114ecFa4] [^115tuZES], and avoid initiating in those ≥ 60 years [^117541b1] or with elevated bleeding risk [^115tuZES]. Use **75–100 mg daily** for secondary prevention; for acute ischemic stroke, give 160–325 mg within 48 hours unless contraindicated [^111ukY9k] [^114VYyPB]. Balance bleeding risk — especially gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage — against potential benefits [^113UbwMn] [^114f49y7].

---

## Mechanism of action

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits COX-1**, reducing thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation and thrombosis [^114b5ED1] [^114dETM8].

---

## Clinical evidence for secondary prevention

Robust evidence supports aspirin for **secondary prevention** of ischemic stroke and TIA:

- **Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration**: 22% relative risk reduction (RRR) in serious vascular events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, vascular death) in high-risk patients, including those with prior stroke or TIA [^114dETM8].

- **International Stroke Trial (IST)**: 160–300 mg aspirin within 48 hours of ischemic stroke reduced recurrent ischemic stroke and death without excess hemorrhagic stroke [^114dETM8].

- **Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST)**: 160 mg aspirin within 48 hours reduced 4-week mortality and recurrent ischemic stroke [^114dETM8].

- **Long-term secondary prevention**: 75–100 mg daily reduces recurrent stroke by ~13% and vascular death by ~15% [^113tY3WP] [^1138fSMF].

---

## Clinical evidence for primary prevention

Aspirin's role in **primary prevention** is limited and controversial:

- **Early trials**: Modest reductions in cardiovascular events, but increased bleeding risk [^112id9hc] [^112E294o].

- **Contemporary trials (2018)**: ARRIVE, ASCEND, and ASPREE showed no significant reduction in cardiovascular events or stroke, with increased major bleeding [^116A6Rsb] [^112E294o].

- **Meta-analyses**: Small cardiovascular benefit offset by increased bleeding, especially gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage [^116hjCXJ] [^113UbwMn].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Level of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or TIA | Aspirin 75–100 mg daily | Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence [^113tY3WP] [^1138fSMF] |
| Acute ischemic stroke (within 48 hours) | Aspirin 160–325 mg daily | Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence [^114VYyPB] [^111ukY9k] |
| Primary prevention (general population) | Not recommended | Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence [^1177Sb2N] [^115tuZES] |
| Primary prevention (adults 40–59 years, ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk) | Consider individual use after shared decision-making | Moderate recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^114ecFa4] [^111wnEey] |
| Primary prevention (adults ≥ 60 years) | Not recommended | Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence [^117541b1] [^115JFuP5] |

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Aspirin increases **major bleeding**, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage [^113UbwMn] [^114f49y7]; the absolute risk is higher in older adults, those with hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, or concomitant anticoagulant/NSAID use [^114DBJ9A]. Hemorrhagic stroke risk is increased, particularly in primary prevention settings [^1167CoXX] [^114f49y7].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from aspirin therapy

Aspirin is beneficial in **secondary prevention** for patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA [^111oBoek] [^1138fSMF], those with symptomatic carotid stenosis [^notfound], and individuals with other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease) [^115y349V]. For **primary prevention**, benefits are limited to select adults aged 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk after shared decision-making [^114ecFa4] [^111wnEey].

---

## Patient populations not benefiting from aspirin therapy

Aspirin is not recommended for **primary prevention** in adults aged ≥ 60 years due to increased bleeding risk and lack of cardiovascular benefit [^117541b1] [^115JFuP5], patients with elevated bleeding risk (e.g. peptic ulcer disease, anticoagulant use) [^114DBJ9A], or those with hemorrhagic stroke or active gastrointestinal bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antiplatelet therapies

Clopidogrel is an alternative for patients intolerant to aspirin or as part of dual antiplatelet therapy in specific scenarios [^116NgHZv] [^114CqY8r]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is recommended for **short-term use (21–90 days)** after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to reduce early recurrence, but is associated with increased bleeding risk [^114KmBAE] [^115zv25U].

---

## Practical considerations and clinical decision-making

- **Dosing**: 75–100 mg daily for secondary prevention; 160–325 mg daily for acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours [^113tY3WP] [^114VYyPB].

- **Bleeding risk assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. HAS-BLED) and consider patient-specific factors (age, hypertension, gastrointestinal history, concomitant medications) [^114DBJ9A].

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential in primary prevention to weigh modest cardiovascular benefit against significant bleeding risk [^114ecFa4] [^111wnEey].

---

Aspirin is a cornerstone for **secondary prevention** of ischemic stroke and TIA, with clear net benefit [^1165gxwv]. For primary prevention, routine use is not recommended; consider only in select adults 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk after shared decision-making, and avoid initiating in those ≥ 60 years or with elevated bleeding risk [^114ecFa4] [^115tuZES].

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating clopidogrel 75 mg/day, in addition to aspirin, for up to 90 days to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with recent (within 30 days) stroke or TIA attributable to severe stenosis (70–99%) of a major intracranial artery.

Aspirin primary prevention — risk–benefit profile: In primary prevention trials, there was no evidence of a protective effect on vascular death subsets — coronary heart disease (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78–1.15; p = 0.5), stroke (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.84–1.74; p = 0.2), or remaining vascular causes (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.65–1.26; p = 0.4). Aspirin had no significant effect on nonvascular mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85–1.02; p = 0.1) or unknown causes, but increased major extracranial bleeds (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.31–1.83; P < .0001). Among low-risk individuals (annual risk ≤ 1%), aspirin avoided four (95% CI, 2–6) occlusive vascular events per 1,000 over 5 years, chiefly three (95% CI, 1–5) fewer major coronary events, offset by two (95% CI, 1–3) additional major extracranial bleeds per 1,000 and no significant excess hemorrhagic stroke (0.1 [95% CI, −0.5 to 0.7] excess; P not significant). Among moderate-risk participants (yearly coronary heart disease risk > 1%), the net effect over 5 years was statistically uncertain (13 [95% CI, −3–29] fewer; p = 0.1) despite a reduction in major coronary events (18 [95% CI, 5–30] fewer per 1,000) and was accompanied by no significant reduction in presumed ischemic stroke and an excess of hemorrhagic stroke (five [95% CI, 1–9] more per 1,000) and major bleeds (4 more per 1,000 [95% CI, one fewer to 10 more]). The majority (92%) of primary prevention participants was at low absolute risk, and when used for primary prevention, fewer than one person of every 1,000 treated with aspirin would avoid an occlusive vascular event, whereas a comparably small number would experience a major extracranial bleed; three subsequently completed primary prevention trials involving 7,165 patients with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, or both were consistent with these findings, and a meta-analysis of all nine primary prevention trials demonstrated a borderline significant reduction in all-cause mortality with aspirin but no reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

### Aspirin in patients with acute ischemic stroke… [^111ukY9k]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does aspirin decrease morbidity or mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Evidence-Based Answer Aspirin in a daily dose of 160 to 300 mg initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset results in a net decrease in morbidity and mortality caused by acute ischemic stroke, regardless of the availability of computed tomography. At a maximum of six months follow-up, aspirin therapy resulted in decreased odds of death or dependency, age, sex, level of consciousness, history of atrial fibrillation, heparin administration, CT findings, or previous CT scanning. Patients with a hemorrhagic stroke who were inadvertently randomized did not appear to be harmed by aspirin. 6 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 441 patients evaluated the effects of aspirin 325 mg daily for five days on progression of acute ischemic stroke compared with placebo. Aspirin did not affect stroke progression during the treatment period, at discharge, or at three months as measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Supervision Scale. This study was not powered to detect the size of effect reported in the Cochrane review and meta-analysis described above.
7. Clinical Commentary The data are clear — in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, aspirin reduces the risk of death and recurrent stroke. Because it is inexpensive and well tolerated, it should be used routinely in this setting. However, physicians should keep in mind that other common clinical interventions, including blood pressure control, statin use, and smoking cessation, are each about three times more effective than aspirin at preventing future stroke. All these interventions must be integrated into the care of the patient with stroke for optimal long-term outcomes.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^111Muetr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The new USPSTF recommendations are important as guidelines for clinical decision-making and a formalized reflection of the multi-decade struggle to define the role of aspirin in primary CVD prevention. Traditional platelet-agnostic trial design methods have repeatedly failed to refine clinical practice while the burden of CVD is persistent. Thus, a new model for the study of aspirin in primary CVD prevention is needed. A platelet-focused approach appears prudent given the centrality of platelets in CVD pathogenesis, thrombosis, and hemostasis, aspirin's well-characterized antiplatelet mechanism, and the successful adoption of biomarker-led approaches in other areas of CVD prevention. Shifting to this new model will require well-designed trials to prospectively investigate the associations between baseline platelet phenotype, CV risk factors, low-dose aspirin therapy, and longitudinal clinical outcomes. We are optimistic that, in the near future, we will use precision-guided antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

### Within-the-clinic shared decision for an over-the-counter medication [^117KqrSu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin and its relatives are some of the oldest and most widely used drugs, dating back thousands of years and treating aches, pains, and fevers. Since the 1980s, aspirin has been regularly used to prevent and treat heart disease and stroke. Unlike the robust data supporting the use of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, uncertainty remains regarding its role in primary prevention. The uncertainty behind aspirin use in primary prevention is mainly due to imprecision underlying the relative size of the risk and benefit of aspirin use in a low‐risk, otherwise healthy population. 1 Despite this, nearly every major cardiovascular health organization has published guidelines and statements on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Controversy and complexity of the available research combined with the over‐the‐counter accessibility of aspirin make translation of the evidence into practice particularly challenging for both clinicians and patients alike.

In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned grade‐A recommendations for the use of aspirin in men ages 45 to 79 years for the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and in women ages 55 to 79 years for the prevention of ischemic stroke, in both cases where the prevention risks outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 2 These recommendations are echoed to varying degrees in multiple cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines, including those of the American Heart Association (AHA). 3 Conversely, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 declared that the available evidence does not support the general use of aspirin for primary prevention. These conflicting statements can be confusing for both healthcare providers and patients to digest, potentially leading to underutilization of aspirin for primary prevention. 4 The key for appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention lies in the identification of the correct candidate for whom aspirin use is truly beneficial. This can be a complex task as consensus on assessment of cardiovascular risk remains elusive, and integrating bleeding risk with cardiovascular risk further complicates the decision‐making process.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy versus aspirin in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115zv25U]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Antiplatelet therapy is key for preventing thrombotic events after transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. Although the role of aspirin is well established, there is emerging evidence for the role of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in preventing recurrent stroke.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and study-level meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials comparing outcomes of early initiation of short-term DAPT (aspirin+P2Y12 inhibitor for up to 3 months) versus aspirin alone in patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack. Primary efficacy outcome was risk of recurrent stroke and primary safety outcome was incidence of major bleeding. Secondary outcomes studied were risk of any ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause death. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Four trials with a total of 21459 patients were included. As compared to aspirin alone, DAPT had a lower risk of recurrent stroke (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.68–0.83]; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) but a higher risk of major bleeding events (RR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.14–4.34], P = 0.02, I2 = 46.5%). Patients receiving DAPT had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69–0.84], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and recurrent ischemic events (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.67–0.82], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%).

Conclusions

As compared to aspirin alone, short-term DAPT within 24 hours of high-risk transient ischemic attack or mild-moderate ischemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent stroke at the expense of higher risk of major bleeding.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112yAchP]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years ago, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration published the first individual participant data (IPD) overview of 145 randomized trials of prolonged antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (vascular events) in various categories of patients. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was 'medium dose' (75–325 mg/day) aspirin, and the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium-dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. At about the same time, I published a review article on aspirin as an antiplatelet drug that concluded 'The present recommendation of a single loading dose of 200 to 300 mg followed by a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg is based on findings that this dose is as clinically efficacious as higher doses and is safer than higher doses'. Moreover, I added 'the efficacy of a cheap drug such as aspirin in preventing one fifth to one third of all important cardiovascular events should not discourage the pharmaceutical industry from attempting to develop more effective antithrombotic drugs, since a sizable proportion of these events continue to occur despite currently available therapy'.

During the past 30 years, we have witnessed several developments in the antiplatelet field, including (i) a large number of trials exploring the role of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;(ii) several attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop antiplatelet drugs, more effective and safer than aspirin;(iii) a shift in emphasis from efficacy to safety leading to a strong opinion movement favouring aspirin-free antiplatelet regimens after percutaneous coronary intervention; and (iv) an IPD meta-analysis comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention of coronary events. Moreover, evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other digestive tract) cancer has strengthened, as recently reviewed.

The aim of this article is to revisit the role of aspirin in the prevention of atherothrombosis across the cardiovascular risk continuum, in view of developments in the antiplatelet field. The review will offer a clinical perspective on aspirin's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This will be followed by a detailed discussion of its clinical efficacy and safety (Graphical Abstract).

### Contemporary antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a narrative review of current literature and guidelines [^114dETM8]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Single-antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin

Aspirin irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and inhibits platelet aggregation. In 1994, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration study evaluated 145 RCTs regarding aspirin in preventing ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarct or vascular death. Aspirin treatment was associated with a 22% relative risk reduction of vascular event in patients with history of AIS or TIA.

Table 1 lists the key RCTs of antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention. The International Stroke Trial (IST) randomised patients to aspirin 300 mg daily, subcutaneous heparin, both or neither within 48 hours of ischaemic stroke for up to 2 weeks. The aspirin group had significantly fewer recurrent ischaemic stroke (2.8% vs 3.9%, p < 0.001) but equal rates of haemorrhage. The Chinese Acute Stroke Trial was similar in design except for a different aspirin dose (160 mg daily) and duration (4 weeks). There were significantly lower absolute risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in the aspirin group (1.6% vs 2.1%, p = 0.01). In a Cochrane systematic review of 8 RCTs with 41 483 participants on oral antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention, aspirin 160–300 mg daily, started within 48 hours of stroke onset, reduced the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without significant risk of haemorrhagic complications.

Aspirin (75–100 mg) compared with no aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease reports outcome-specific relative risks as follows: MI nonfatal events RR 0.77 (0.67–0.89), Stroke includes nonfatal ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes RR 0.95 (0.85–1.06), and Major extracranial bleed RR 1.54 (1.30–1.82).

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1125SJyG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, another checked for accuracy, and 2 assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

In CVD primary prevention studies, very-low-dose aspirin use (≤ 100 mg daily or every other day) increased major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk by 58% (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.29 to 1.95]) and hemorrhagic stroke risk by 27% (OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68]). Projected excess bleeding events with aspirin depend on baseline assumptions. Estimated excess major bleeding events were 1.39 (CI, 0.70 to 2.28) for GI bleeding and 0.32 (CI, -0.05 to 0.82) for hemorrhagic stroke per 1000 person-years of aspirin exposure using baseline bleeding rates from a community-based observational sample. Such events could be greater among older persons, men, and those with CVD risk factors that also increase bleeding risk.

Limitations

Power to detect effects on hemorrhagic stroke was limited. Harms other than serious bleeding were not examined.

Conclusion

Consideration of the safety of primary prevention with aspirin requires an individualized assessment of aspirin's effects on bleeding risks and expected benefits because absolute bleeding risk may vary considerably by patient.

### Atherothrombosis and the role of antiplatelet therapy [^114R38CV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Atherothrombosis remains a major global public health problem. Chronic atherosclerotic disease is often clinically silent and coexists across vascular beds, but when complicated by thrombosis can result in acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischaemic attack and critical limb ischaemia. Platelets play a role in the development of chronic atherosclerotic disease and are a key mediator of clinical events in atherothrombosis. Numerous trials have examined the role of antiplatelet agents in primary and secondary prevention and several new antiplatelet drugs are under development. In secondary prevention, there is evidence of clear benefit of single and in some cases dual antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent cerebro-vascular complications. Dual antiplatelet therapy has emerged as the standard of care in acute coronary syndromes, with aspirin typically being used in combination with clopidogrel or one of the newer more potent antiplatelet agents. Conversely, in chronic stable coronary disease, no benefit has yet been convincingly demonstrated from dual antiplatelet therapy. In cerebro-vascular disease, aspirin monotherapy remains the cornerstone of prevention of recurrent events, with clopidogrel or the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole being only modestly more efficacious. In primary prevention, the evidence for the routine use of aspirin or any other antiplatelet agent is mixed and suggests this should only be considered on an individual basis in high-risk groups where the thrombotic risk outweighs the risk of major bleeding complications.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113VxEnY]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Silent brain infarcts — prevention — Take a careful history to determine whether the infarction was symptomatic. Implement preventive care recommended by AHA/ASA (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) guidelines for primary prevention of ischemic stroke. The effectiveness of aspirin to prevent stroke has not been studied in this setting. The clinician should be aware that there is an increased risk for future stroke, and it is reasonable to consider this information when making decisions about anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, revascularization for carotid stenosis, treatment of hypertension, and initiation of statin therapy, while noting that the role of silent brain infarcts in these decisions has not been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention [^114CqY8r]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death. Ischemic stroke is a syndrome with heterogeneous mechanisms and multiple etiologies, rather than a singularly defined disease. Approximately one third of ischemic strokes are preceded by another cerebrovascular ischemic event. Stroke survivors are at high risk of vascular events (i.e., cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events), particularly during the first several months after the ischemic event. The use of antiplatelet agents remains the fundamental component of secondary stroke prevention. Based on the available data, antiplatelet agents should be used for patients with noncardioembolic stroke. The use of combination therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) has not been proven to be effective or safe to use for prevention of early stroke recurrence or in long-term treatment. There is no convincing evidence that any of the available antiplatelet agents are superior for a given stroke subtype. Currently, the uses of aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin combined with extended release dipyridamole are all valid alternatives after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. However, to maximize the effects of these agents, the treatment should be initiated as early as possible and be continued on a lifelong basis.

### Aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke: what's the right dose? [^115QpHt2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Despite hundreds of clinical trials, the appropriate dose of aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is uncertain. In the US, the doses most frequently recommended are 80, 160, or 325 mg per day. Because aspirin can cause major bleeding, the appropriate dose is the lowest dose that is effective in preventing both MI and stroke because these two diseases frequently co-exist. Five randomized clinical trials have compared aspirin with placebo or no therapy for the prevention of stroke and MI. These trials varied with regard to the dose of aspirin, the duration of treatment, and, most important, the populations selected for study varied in their baseline risk of stroke and MI. In men, 160 mg/day consistently lowered the risk of MI. In women, doses of 50 mg, 75, and 100 mg/day did not significantly decrease the risk of MI; therefore, the appropriate dose in women must exceed 100 mg/day. The appropriate dose for the primary prevention of stroke in men and women has not been established. Doses of 75 and 100 mg/day have been ineffective in men and women. The appropriate dose must be at least 160 mg/day. The lowest dose to prevent recurrent MI or death in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is 75 mg/day. In acute MI the lowest dose is 160 mg/day. In patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 50 mg/day has been shown to be effective in men and women. In acute stroke, 160 mg/day is effective in preventing recurrent stroke or death. The risk of major bleeding with 160 mg/day is the same as with 80 mg/day: 1 to 2 cases per 1000 patient years of treatment, and the risk of fatal bleeding is the same with 80 and 160 mg/day. These studies indicate that the most appropriate dose for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke and MI is 160 mg/day.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115JFuP5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of older adults, there was no statistically significant benefit from aspirin in preventing stroke or any conventional stroke etiological subtype. However, aspirin significantly increased the overall risk of intracranial bleeding. These data support the recommendation of the USPSTF that low-dose aspirin should not be prescribed for primary prevention in healthy older adults.

### Aspirin dosing for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke: an indication-specific review of the literature [^111oXrN9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of aspirin for the treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke and identify the minimum dose proven to be effective for each indication.

Data Sources

PubMed and MEDLINE searches (up to January 2010) were performed to identify primary literature, using search terms including aspirin, stroke prevention, acute ischemic stroke, acetylsalicylic acid, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and carotid endarterectomy. Additionally, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles published in English were evaluated and relevant primary literature evaluating the efficacy of aspirin in the prevention of stroke was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Antiplatelet therapy is the benchmark for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Aspirin has been proven to prevent ischemic stroke in a variety of settings. Despite the frequency at which aspirin continues to be prescribed in patients at risk of ischemic stroke, there remains confusion in clinical practice as to what minimum dose is required in various at-risk patients. A thorough review of the primary literature suggests that low-dose (50–81 mg daily) aspirin is insufficient for some indications. Acute ischemic stroke treatment requires 160–325 mg, while atrial fibrillation and carotid arterial disease require daily doses of 325 and 81–325 mg, respectively.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that aspirin dosing must be individualized according to indication. Recommendations provided by national guidelines at times recommend lower doses of aspirin than have been proven effective. Higher doses are indicated for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (325 mg) and acute ischemic stroke patients (160–325 mg). Aspirin has not yet been proven effective for primary prevention of strokes in men, and a minimum dose for these patients cannot be determined from the available data.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116abzZB]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^112wYM4j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116c2hck]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) has uncertain optimal duration and hemorrhage tradeoffs; most trials used aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 to 90 days, and whether the duration should be 21 days, 90 days, or some other amount of time is not fully established, and the exact duration at which hemorrhage risk outweighs stroke-prevention benefit is unknown. Older patients and those with more severe stroke appear to be at higher risk of ICH with DAPT. Triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole in TARDIS, compared with standard antiplatelet therapy, found no difference in stroke outcomes and a significantly increased risk of bleeding with triple therapy. There may be other non–stroke-related indications for DAPT beyond 90 days after stroke, but these indications should be clarified to ensure that DAPT is not continued indefinitely beyond the clinically recommended time frame.

In JPPP, participants between 60 and 85 years of age with hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia had a primary end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; the study was stopped for futility after 60 months of follow-up, with a primary end point of 2.77% with aspirin and 2.96% with placebo.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115y349V]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Versus placebo

The clinical efficacy of aspirin as an antithrombotic agent has been evaluated in placebo-controlled RCTs addressing the whole spectrum of atherosclerosis, from apparently healthy, middle-aged, low-risk individuals to patients presenting with acute MI or acute ischaemic stroke. Moreover, aspirin trials have used variable follow-up, from as short as a few weeks to as long as 10 years.

In the Second International Study of Infarct Survival, once-daily dosing with low-dose aspirin (162.5 mg) started within 24 h of the onset of symptoms of a suspected MI produced highly significant reductions in 5 week vascular mortality (the primary endpoint) by 23%, non-fatal reinfarction by 49%, and non-fatal stroke by 46% in over 17 000 patients. Three smaller but longer-term (12 weeks to 2 years) placebo-controlled RCTs in ∼2600 patients with unstable coronary artery disease consistently showed that aspirin therapy (75 to 1300 mg daily) halved the probability of death or MI, independent of the aspirin dose. Two RCTs with a similar protocol, the International Stroke Trialand the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial, randomized approximately 40 000 patients within 48 h of the onset of symptoms of an acute ischaemic stroke to 2 to 4 weeks of daily aspirin therapy (300 and 160 mg, respectively) or placebo and showed more modest reductions in death or non-fatal stroke than reported in acute MI (Figure 6).

Based on a large number of placebo-controlled RCTs, long-term (2 to 3 year) aspirin therapy confers conclusive net benefit on the risk of subsequent MI, stroke, or vascular death among subjects at high risk of vascular complications (Figure 6). The proportional effects of long-term aspirin therapy on vascular events in these different clinical settings are rather homogeneous, ranging between 20% and 25% odds reduction based on an overview of all RCTs. The absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis in different categories of patients are detailed in Figure 6.

### Antiplatelet use in ischemic stroke [^114aiKQq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Several strategies could be considered to improve the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of stroke in future research trials and clinical practice. It appears that in the vast majority of cases, the long-term secondary prevention of stroke is best managed using either clopidogrel or aspirin. In the acute setting, there are several issues that potentially could be improved using alternative antiplatelet agents. When considering these issues, the application of a personalized medicine approach to the treatment of stroke with antiplatelets should be considered.

There is a large body of evidence to suggest that certain platelet genetic polymorphisms can render patients resistant to treatment with either clopidogrel or aspirin. Given the strong evidence base for the use of aspirin and clopidogrel in AIS and in secondary prevention, screening for these polymorphisms upon initial stroke presentation could be considered when personalizing the approach to antiplatelet use. These results could inform whether to consider combination therapy, switch antiplatelet agent, or increase the aspirin dose, although these options must be balanced against the risk of bleeding, drug adverse effects, and the possibility of resistance to other antiplatelet medications. The greatest risk of recurrent stroke is within the first 30 days of the initial event. Therefore, in future clinical settings, as genetic phenotyping becomes more accessible, this may be done as part of the initial stroke assessment. This would allow the stroke physician to then make a more informed decision as to which antiplatelet agent to use in cases of clopidogrel or aspirin resistance.

### Antiplatelet use in ischemic stroke [^111ZXuhZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Antiplatelet agents remain one of the most efficacious and best researched secondary preventive measures for the treatment of stroke. The use of both clopidogrel and aspirin is well established in both the acute and secondary prevention settings and is the basis of most clinical guidelines around the world. Although there is already good evidence for the appropriate use of antiplatelets postischemic stroke, future research may focus on how to personalize the approach to antiplatelet prescription. This may take the form of screening patients for platelet polymorphisms that confer antiplatelet resistance or extending randomized controlled trial level evidence to be more encompassing of the diverse racial populations that are affected by stroke.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114ecFa4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

### The role of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113su7Tg]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke and thromboembolism, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. For the majority of patients with AF, aspirin has a limited role in stroke prevention, being an inferior strategy and not necessarily safer than the anticoagulant warfarin, especially in the elderly. Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Nonetheless, aspirin use should continue in the early stages following presentation of a patient with AF and acute coronary syndrome, and after stenting, in combination with oral anticoagulant drugs and clopidogrel, as appropriate. Notably, aspirin combined with clopidogrel shows only modest benefit in stroke prevention compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with AF who refuse oral anticoagulant drugs (including warfarin), or in those individuals who have difficulties in anticoagulation monitoring, and can be used where bleeding risk is not excessive.

### Role of antiplatelet drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events [^1142tgp7]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet drugs have an established place in the prevention of vascular events in a variety of clinical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Both European and American guidelines recommend the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with established coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic disease. In high-risk patients, such as those with post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and in patients with stable or unstable angina, peripheral arterial occlusive disease or atrial fibrillation, antiplatelet treatment may reduce the risk of a serious cardiovascular event by approximately 25%, including reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarction by 1/6, non-fatal stroke by 1/4 and cardiovascular death by 1/6. Some data indicate that antiplatelet drugs may also have a role in primary prevention. In people who are aged over 65 years, or have hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, obesity or familial history of myocardial infarction at young age, aspirin may reduce both cardiovascular deaths and total cardiovascular events. Aspirin has been studied and used most extensively. It may exert its beneficial effect not only by acting on platelets, but also by other mechanisms, such as preventing thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-induced vasoconstriction or reducing inflammation. Indeed, experimental data show that low-dose aspirin may suppress vascular inflammation and thereby increase the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, in human studies, aspirin seems to be most effective in those with elevated C-reactive protein levels. Vascular events, however, do occur despite aspirin administration. This may be due to platelet activation by pathways not blocked by aspirin, intake of drugs that interfere with aspirin effect or aspirin resistance. In the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) study, long-term clopidogrel administered to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease was more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. In the setting of coronary stenting, a double regimen including aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel has proved more effective in the prevention of in-stent thrombosis than aspirin alone. Chronic oral administration of the inhibitors of platelet membrane receptor GP IIb/IIIa has been largely disappointing.

### Contemporary primary prevention aspirin use by cardiovascular disease risk: impact of US preventive services task force recommendations, 2007–2015: a serial, cross-sectional study [^116CMPpq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate Aspirin Use

Aspirin use is effective in preventing first heart attacks and strokes, although at the cost of an increased risk of bleeding events. A 2012 meta‐analysis of the net benefit of aspirin to prevent vascular events reported a 31% excess in nontrivial bleeding (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–1.50). 42 Yet, there is not an identical health impact of a heart attack or stroke and a reversible, nonfatal bleeding event. Thus, "appropriate aspirin use" could be defined as prescription of aspirin to prevent a first cardiovascular ischemic event, when benefit is greater than risk, as informed by patient preferences. To achieve this clinical goal requires thoughtful discussion by an informed clinician who engages an informed "at‐risk" patient, on the individual level.

Clinicians may be concerned about "inappropriate" aspirin use in populations with low CVD risk. 43 In this study, 41% of individuals with a 10‐year CVD risk of < 10% used aspirin and 33% of those with CVD risk < 5% used aspirin. This high prevalence of aspirin use may reflect a lack of consensus on which patients might benefit from aspirin use as reflected by the differing recommendations released by various guideline committees. The 2009 recommendations used different risk thresholds based on age and sex, thus many people with 5% to 10% risk would have met the qualifications for aspirin use. Interestingly, the pattern of aspirin use in the group with 5% to 10% risk was the same as the other risk categories, with a slight decline in aspirin use during the years following the 2009 recommendations. These methods are unable to account for people taking aspirin for pain relief or any other noncardiovascular indication. It also cannot assess individual preference when ascribing value to CVD prevention versus bleeding risk. Thus, it is not possible to discern whether such use in low CVD risk populations is "inappropriate".

### Antiplatelet agents in secondary prevention of stroke: a perspective [^114RymWE]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Antiplatelet agents are widely used in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events. The purpose of this review is to give a perspective of the factors involved in clinical practice for selecting antiplatelet drugs appropriate to the patient population.

Summary Of Review

Aspirin remains the most popular drug, because it is modestly effective (approximately 25% risk reduction); however, it has undesirable side effects that are sometimes serious. The nonaspirin compounds are marginally more effective but are much more expensive and subject to commercial pressures from industry. A completely new look at these compounds is necessary, rather than spending more precious resources on "drug wars" that are expensive in time and money.

Conclusions

A "polypill" has been previously proposed, and possibly a combination of drugs targeted at the major vascular risk factors that is given to patients within 24 hours of initial stroke symptoms and to clearly defined patient populations may prove a solution.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113UbwMn]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Harms of preventive medication — low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/d) bleeding risks: Across CVD primary prevention trials, "The USPSTF reviewed 14 RCTs". For low-dose aspirin, a pooled analysis of "10 trials (n = 119 130)" found a "58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38–1.80])", and "a pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134 470) showed an increase in intracranial bleeds" (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54]). Low-dose aspirin "was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke". Bleeding "occurs relatively quickly after initiating aspirin", with no differential relative bleeding risk by "age, sex, presence of diabetes, level of CVD risk, or race or ethnicity", but "the absolute incidence of bleeding… increases with age, and more so in adults 60 years or older".

### Effect of aspirin on mortality in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113jgpBQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of a mortality benefit of aspirin in prior meta-analyses of primary prevention trials of cardiovascular disease has contributed to uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in primary prevention. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of aspirin to obtain best estimates of the effect of aspirin on mortality in primary prevention.

Methods

Eligible articles were identified by searches of electronic databases and reference lists. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding. Data were pooled from individual trials using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, and results are presented as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Nine randomized controlled trials enrolling 100,076 participants were included. Aspirin reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.00), myocardial infarction (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00), ischemic stroke (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.94), but did not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84–1.09). Aspirin increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.82), major bleeding (RR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.41–1.95), and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15–1.62). A lack of availability of patient-level data precluded exploration of benefits and risks of aspirin in key subgroups.

Conclusion

Aspirin prevents deaths, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, and increases hemorrhagic stroke and major bleeding when used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1173dGik]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that has been used in low doses (75–100 mg/d) for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite some recent unfavorable findings, it continues to be widely used for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Its major adverse effect is an increased bleeding tendency.,

Information about the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of stroke is derived from meta-analyses and results of recent major trials, most of which have been conducted in populations with mean ages younger than 70 years. Despite some inconsistency, these reports suggest a trend toward reduced ischemic stroke counterbalanced by increased intracerebral and other intracranial hemorrhage, with little overall impact on total stroke incidence.

Clinical characteristics of older individuals include an increased inherent susceptibility to hemorrhage, which may be associated with increased fragility of small blood vessels. In addition, older individuals experience an increased susceptibility to major and minor trauma as a result of falls and other accidents. Together, these outcomes may alter the balance of risks and benefits of an antiplatelet drug, especially if given to individuals at low risk in a primary prevention setting. This concern is relevant given the high stroke risk in older individuals, worldwide increases in populations of older individuals, and the importance of evaluating preventive strategies in this age group.

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial is the largest randomized controlled trial of low-dose aspirin focused on investigating the balance of risks and benefits of this therapy in an older age group. In addition to its large size, the ASPREE study design included independent adjudication of stroke and hemorrhagic events by independent expert panels. It was therefore ideally positioned to evaluate the balance of risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin in a primary prevention setting. In this study, we provide a comprehensive report on the incidence of first stroke and bleeding events occurring during the median 4.7 years of follow-up of the trial.

### Aspirin for primary prevention-time to rethink our approach… [^113BVCwE]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of CVD, but its role in primary prevention remains uncertain. Over the past several decades, there has been great interest to identify individuals for whom the clinical benefit of aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke exceeds the risk of bleeding. Meta-analyses of early primary prevention trials of aspirin suggested a modest benefit of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of first heart attack or stroke at the cost of excess major bleeding. 2, 3 In fact, the number needed to treat to prevent a single cardiovascular event was comparable to the number needed to harm by causing 1 major bleeding event.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend that low-dose aspirin use might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults ages 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. 1 Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years, or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. The European Society of Cardiology suggests that among individuals at very high CVD risk, low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention. 9 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.
10. Among adults with elevated blood pressure, pharmacologic therapy is used when blood pressure is sufficiently high, with blood pressure targets guided by background CVD risk. In contrast, aspirin is not considered in individuals based on their platelet activity.

However, if clinicians were able to identify individuals based on their increased platelet activity and an individual's likelihood of experiencing a platelet-mediated event, use of antiplatelet therapy and aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke should be possible. Future study of aspirin for CVD prevention will require novel designs. Instead of identifying individuals' global CVD risk using traditional risk factors, the individual patient's platelet phenotype could be considered for the initiation of platelet targeting therapy, including aspirin. Because individuals with increased platelet activity are at greater cardiovascular risk and because aspirin decreases platelet activity, measuring platelet activity or the platelet transcriptome in individuals without CVD may help to identify a high-risk group that would benefit from preventive aspirin therapy.

### Recent clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy in secondary stroke prevention: expectations and results for application in primary care settings [^113XVHTi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies significantly reduce the risk of secondary noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. First-line treatment for secondary stroke prevention involves the use of antiplatelet drugs over oral anticoagulation therapies; antiplatelet treatment options include aspirin, aspirin in combination with extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP), or clopidogrel. Aspirin plus ER-DP has been shown to be effective for secondary stroke prevention, whereas aspirin plus clopidogrel offers no additive benefits and is associated with safety issues. During the past several years, significant progress has been made in secondary stroke prevention, which continues to be an active area of interest. Today's primary care physicians are challenged with keeping abreast of new findings and ensuring that guideline-recommended therapies are initiated and maintained as indicated. It is important that primary care physicians be knowledgeable of the evidence by which clinical practice guidelines have been developed and on which their treatment decisions are based. In the future, antiplatelet treatment may be tailored based on patient risk. Forthcoming trial data may offer additional insight into the roles of antiplatelet agents and appropriate identification and treatment of different patient types. This review provides primary care physicians with timely evidence- and guideline-based recommendations on prevention of secondary stroke.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^113KnG66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a challenging issue for clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Even with the availability of multiple randomized trials and several high‐quality systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, significant debate remains about which patients, if any, should be offered aspirin for primary prevention. – The main US guideline‐issuing organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association, have made recommendations in favor of aspirin use for primary prevention in people with increased CVD risk who are not at high risk for aspirin's adverse effects. – Others have recommended against aspirin use for most patients without a prior history of CVD events. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement reaffirming that "[it] has reviewed the available data and does not believe the evidence supports the general use of aspirin for primary prevention of a heart attack or stroke".

Much of the debate about aspirin's use for primary prevention centers on 2 key issues: (1) how to integrate information on potential benefits derived from multiple trials that were performed in heterogeneous populations, that used a range of doses of aspirin, and that were conducted in the context of differing availability of other effective interventions, such as statins; and (2) how to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the known harms of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, less commonly but more seriously, hemorrhagic stroke. Most analyses accept the general concept that aspirin will be more clearly indicated for people at higher CVD risk because even a modest reduction in relative risk of CVD events would offer net benefit after taking into account aspirin's effects on bleeding.

The potential stakes of the aspirin decision are enormous. Decisions about aspirin for primary prevention could apply to the more than 100 million US adults aged 40 to 75 years. CVD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $200 billion in direct and indirect care costs. Cost‐effectiveness analyses have suggested that aspirin, if modestly effective for CVD prevention, could extend lives and reduce health care costs, particularly in higher‐risk patients. – An analysis by the Prevention Priorities Project ranks aspirin near the top of all preventive services in terms of cost‐effectiveness and ability to reduce burden of suffering. Alternatively, if the downsides of aspirin exceed its benefits (overall or in people below a certain level of CVD risk), widespread use could cause large amounts of morbidity and deflect health resources from better uses.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials [^111NrYtq]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke on the basis of trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major stroke is very high for only the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated.

Methods

Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, stratified by severity of baseline neurological deficit, to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this differs by severity at baseline.

Findings

We pooled data for 15,778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an ischaemic stroke vs 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·32–0·55, p < 0·0001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 vs 110 of 7326; 0·29, 0·20–0·42, p < 0·0001), with greatest benefit noted in patients presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0–2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·02–0·31, p = 0·0004; at 0–6 weeks, 14 vs 60 participants, 0·19, 0·11–0·34, p < 0·0001). The effect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·42, 0·26–0·70, p = 0·0007). These effects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6–12 weeks, but there was no benefit after 12 weeks (stroke risk OR 0·97, 0·84–1·12, p = 0·67; severity mRS shift OR 1·00, 0·77–1·29, p = 0·97). By contrast, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 0·90, 95% CI 0·65–1·25, p = 0·53; mRS shift OR 0·90, 0·37–1·72, p = 0·99), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (0·76, 0·63–0·92, p = 0·005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0·64, 0·49–0·84, p = 0·0010). We pooled data for 40,531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline deficits, and was substantial by the second day after starting treatment (2–3 day HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·25–0·57, p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Our findings confirm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention. The considerable early benefit from aspirin warrants public education about self-administration after possible TIA. The previously unrecognised effect of aspirin on severity of early recurrent stroke, the diminishing benefit with longer-term use, and the contrasting time course of effects of dipyridamole have implications for understanding mechanisms of action.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^117Fasrx]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Aspirin is an antiplatelet therapy drug and has been shown to protect against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding.
The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy.
Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, could be considered to identify individuals at elevated (platelet mediated) cardiovascular risk.
Clinical studies are needed to investigate whether a platelet-guided precision-based medicine approach will identify individuals who will benefit (eg, benefit > risk) with aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

In October 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft statement updating its guidelines on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The USPSTF recommends the following: (1) low-dose aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention in individuals ages 60 years or older, and (2) initiation of low-dose aspirin should be considered on an individualized basis in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 10%. With the update, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin prescription for primary CVD prevention in any population, a position consistent with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology. The shift reflects a longstanding struggle to identify a population in which aspirin's clinical benefit for primary CVD prevention exceeds its bleeding risk.

### Association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hjCXJ]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The role for aspirin in cardiovascular primary prevention remains controversial, with potential benefits limited by an increased bleeding risk.

Objective

To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies).

Results

A total of 13 trials randomizing 164 225 participants with 1 050 511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53–74), 77 501 (47%) were men, 30 361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2% (range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84–0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30–1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47% [95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding. This information may inform discussions with patients about aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and bleeding.

### Meta-analysis of data from the six primary prevention trials of cardiovascular events using aspirin [^111e5sY1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Until recently, 5 major studies have formed the basis for the use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events. Despite these data, the role of aspirin in primary prevention has not been established firmly. Six randomized trials have evaluated the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events: the British Doctors' Trial, the Physicians' Health Study, the Thrombosis Prevention Trial, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the Primary Prevention Project, and the Women's Health Study. The combined sample consists of 47,293 subjects on aspirin and 45,580 not on aspirin or placebo. A meta-analysis of these 6 trials assessed 6 CV end points: total coronary heart disease (CHD), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), total CV events, stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. No covariate adjustment was performed and appropriate tests for treatment effect, heterogeneity, and study size bias were applied. Using odds ratios and confidence intervals, the meta-analysis suggested superiority of aspirin for total CHD, nonfatal MI, and total CV events (p ≤ 0.001 in each case), with a nonsignificant trend (0.07 < p < 0.34) for decreased risk of stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. There was no evidence of statistical bias (p > 0.05). Given the study size and cohort, aspirin decreased the risk of CV events in this large patient sample. In conclusion, primary prevention with aspirin decreased the risk of total CHD, nonfatal MI, and total CV events, but there were no significant differences in the incidences of stroke or CV mortality.

### Antiplatelet agents for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke [^116c2Hxv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize the efficacy, mechanisms of action, and cost of the options available when choosing antiplatelet agents for secondary stroke prevention.

Data Sources

This article is based on a review of the literature found with MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Reviews (1980-June 2000) and abstracts from relevant international scientific meetings. We searched for the terms aspirin, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, antiplatelet, and clopidogrel.

Study Selection

English-language articles, both reviews and original studies, were evaluated, and all information considered relevant was included in this review. In addition, guidelines from the American Heart Association are included.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin is a relatively inexpensive and effective agent for secondary stroke prevention, and lower doses of aspirin appear as effective as higher doses. Ticlopidine has been used alone or in combination with aspirin, but serious adverse effects have limited its use. Clopidogrel has emerged as a safe and effective alternative to ticlopidine and lacks some of the serious adverse effects associated with ticlopicine, but is not superior to aspirin in secondary stroke prevention. Unlike previous studies, one recent trial showed that dipyridamole in combination with aspirin is superior to aspirin alone.

Conclusions

Antiplatelet therapy is a key component of secondary prevention strategies in ischemic stroke. While aspirin has been the cornerstone in the management of stroke, other classes of antiplatelet drugs present new opportunities to optimize antiplatelet therapy.

### Aspirin in childhood acute ischemic stroke: the evidence for treatment and efficacy testing [^112ErW4J]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent worldwide, but evidence supporting its use varies by age and disease process. Despite its frequent use in childhood acute ischemic stroke prevention and management, major knowledge gaps exist about optimal pediatric aspirin use, particularly in this setting, where high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed. This review focuses upon the evidence for aspirin use in childhood acute ischemic stroke, includes a summary of aspirin pharmacology to highlight misconceptions and common clinical situations which may limit its efficacy, and discusses the techniques and potential role of laboratory monitoring of aspirin efficacy in children.

### An assessment of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke [^114MfPmu]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare methods and key management recommendations from recent stroke prevention guidelines.

Methods

Systematic review of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke published in English between 1996 and 2001 was conducted, and recommendations were independently abstracted and compared.

Results

Among 22 stroke prevention guidelines, information was provided about panel selection in 24%, funding source in 36%, consensus methods in 33%, and quantitative risk/benefit estimates in 38%. Eleven recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke, but eight different sets of criteria to identify high-risk patients were proposed. Recommendations regarding carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis varied from general endorsement in a setting of low perioperative risk to routinely withholding surgery. All nine relevant guidelines endorsed aspirin in dosages between 50 and 325 mg/day for initial antiplatelet therapy following cerebral ischemia; six also suggested other antiplatelet agents as options for initial therapy.

Conclusions

Current stroke prevention guidelines do not provide adequate methodologic information to permit assessment of their quality, potential bias, and clinical applicability. Management recommendations are relatively consistent but differ in several important areas.

### Cilostazol versus aspirin for secondary prevention of vascular events after stroke of arterial origin [^114W1143]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is widely used for secondary prevention after stroke. Cilostazol has shown promise as an alternative to aspirin in Asian people with stroke.

Objectives

To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of cilostazol compared directly with aspirin in the prevention of stroke and other serious vascular events in patients at high vascular risk for subsequent stroke, those with previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke of arterial origin.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2010). In an effort to identify further published, ongoing and unpublished studies we searched journals, conference proceedings and ongoing trial registers, scanned reference lists from relevant studies and contacted trialists and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cilostazol with aspirin where participants were treated for at least one month and followed systematically for development of vascular events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extracted from eligible studies included: (1) a composite outcome of vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death) during follow up (primary outcome); (2) separate outcomes of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, fatal or non-fatal), myocardial infarction (MI) (fatal or non-fatal), vascular death and death from all causes; and (3) main outcomes of safety including any intracranial, extracranial or gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage and other outcomes during treatment follow up (secondary outcomes). We computed an estimate of treatment effect and performed a test for heterogeneity between trials. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and assessed bias for all included studies.

Main Results

We included two RCTs with 3477 Asian participants. Compared with aspirin, cilostazol was associated with a significantly lower risk of composite outcome of vascular events (6.77% versus 9.39%, risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.91), and lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke (0.53% versus 2.01%, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.55). In terms of outcome of safety compared with aspirin, cilostazol was significantly associated with minor adverse effects (8.22% versus 4.95%, RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.83).

Authors' Conclusions

Cilostazol is more effective than aspirin in the prevention of vascular events secondary to stroke. Cilostazol has more minor adverse effects, although there is evidence of fewer bleeds.

### Multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents for preventing early recurrence after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^115NWiMF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antiplatelet agents are considered to be the cornerstone for secondary prevention of stroke, but the role of using multiple antiplatelet agents early after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) to improve outcomes has not been established.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of initiating, within 72 hours after an ischaemic stroke or TIA, multiple antiplatelet agents versus fewer antiplatelet agents to prevent stroke recurrence. The analysis explores the evidence for different drug combinations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 July 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7 of 12, 2020) (last searched 6 July 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 to 6 July 2020), Embase (1980 to 6 July 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and reviews and used the Science Citation Index Cited Reference search for forward tracking of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents initiated within 72 hours after stroke or TIA.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data from eligible studies for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence and vascular death, and secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction; composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; intracranial haemorrhage; extracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; death from all causes; and haemorrhagic stroke. We computed an estimate of treatment effect and performed a test for heterogeneity between trials. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and assessed bias for all studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs with a total of 17,091 participants. Compared with fewer antiplatelet agents, multiple antiplatelet agents were associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke recurrence (5.78% versus 7.84%, risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.82; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) with no significant difference in vascular death (0.60% versus 0.66%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.45; P = 0.94; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a higher risk of intracranial haemorrhage (0.42% versus 0.21%, RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.50; P = 0.03; low-certainty evidence) and extracranial haemorrhage (6.38% versus 2.81%, RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.70; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence) with multiple antiplatelet agents. On secondary analysis of dual versus single antiplatelet agent therapy, benefit for stroke recurrence (5.73% versus 8.06%, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) was maintained as well as risk of extracranial haemorrhage (1.24% versus 0.40%, RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.74 to 5.46; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence). The composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death (6.37% versus 8.77%, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) and ischaemic stroke (6.30% versus 8.94%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.81; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence) were significantly in favour of dual antiplatelet therapy, whilst the risk of intracranial haemorrhage became less significant (0.34% versus 0.21%, RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.06; P = 0.23; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Multiple antiplatelet agents are more effective in reducing stroke recurrence but increase the risk of haemorrhage compared to one antiplatelet agent. The benefit in reduction of stroke recurrence seems to outweigh the harm for dual antiplatelet agents initiated in the acute setting and continued for one month. There is lack of evidence regarding multiple versus multiple antiplatelet agents. Further studies are required in different populations to establish comprehensive safety profiles and long-term outcomes to establish duration of therapy.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115wxL3G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001).

Study Selection

1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use.

Data Extraction

One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events.

Conclusions

The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the 21Century: a review of the evidence [^116A6Rsb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent. Although the evidence for efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with established cardiovascular disease is strong, its role in primary prevention has been subject of controversies over the past decades. In fact, historical trials have shown only modest benefit in terms of reduction of ischemic events, mostly myocardial infarction and to a lesser extent stroke, and only at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. These observations have led to divergent recommendations from professional societies on the use of ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease manifestations. However, recent results from three trials of primary prevention have shown either no benefit or modest benefit on combined ischemic end points, without any impact on hard cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke, accompanied by an increased risk of bleeding. Overall, this translated into neutral net benefit or even harm with the use of aspirin in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease. These results have accordingly led to a downgrade in the current recommendations on the use of ASA for primary prevention. This article provides an overview on the current evidence on the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114gEnPo]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events in subjects without clinical cardiovascular disease relative to the increased risk of bleeding is uncertain.

Methods

A meta-analysis of randomized trials of aspirin versus placebo/control to assess the effect of aspirin on major cardiovascular events (MCEs) (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death), individual components of the MCE, stroke subtype, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Nine trials involving 102,621 patients were included: 52,145 allocated to aspirin and 50,476 to placebo/control.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, aspirin was associated with a reduction in MCE (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.96, P < .001). There was no significant reduction for myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, or all-cause mortality. Aspirin was associated with hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01–1.81, P = 0.04) and major bleeding (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.31–2.00, P < .001). In meta-regression, the benefits and bleeding risks of aspirin were independent of baseline cardiovascular risk, background therapy, age, sex, and aspirin dose. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 MCE over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years was 253 (95% CI 163–568), which was offset by the number needed to harm to cause 1 major bleed of 261 (95% CI 182–476).

Conclusions

The current totality of evidence provides only modest support for a benefit of aspirin in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease, which is offset by its risk. For every 1,000 subjects treated with aspirin over a 5-year period, aspirin would prevent 2.9 MCE and cause 2.8 major bleeds.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate aspirin 325 mg/day over warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and vascular death in patients with stroke or TIA caused by 50–99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery.

### The rise and fall of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112E294o]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide and is generally considered effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^114b5ED1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Clinical Dilemma

Aspirin has been widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic for centuries and became a staple of CVD prevention during the second half of the 20th century. By irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1), aspirin confers protection against platelet-mediated thrombotic events while increasing bleeding risk, setting up its clinical risk-benefit tradeoff. Low-dose aspirin therapy has net value in secondary CVD prevention, reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events by 21% and all-cause mortality by 13% in individuals with preexisting CVD, although the same individuals have more than double the odds of severe bleeding. However, despite the almost 30 million Americans who take aspirin to prevent a first CV event, it is increasingly recognized that this preventive approach should be reassessed. As for the majority of individuals, the clinical risk-benefit tradeoff skews toward higher bleeding risk, and this is increasingly apparent with improved clinical management of other CV risk factors, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In those without preexisting CVD, aspirin yields only modest protection against CV events (0.41% absolute risk reduction) that does not outweigh the associated increased risk of major bleeding (0.47% absolute risk increase). In the absence of broader evidence of aspirin's utility for primary CVD prevention, past trials have attempted to identify specific groups that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin use. Many trials were designed based on the assumption that aspirin's CV benefit increases and bleeding risk remains stable with increasing CV risk of the enrolled population. However, the point on the baseline CV risk spectrum at which aspirin's risk-benefit tradeoff becomes favorable remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk (Figure 1). Meanwhile, atherosclerotic CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 605 000 first heart attacks and 610 000 first strokes each year.

Figure 1.
The clinical benefit and risk of aspirin therapy by baseline cardiovascular risk. Past primary cardiovascular disease prevention trials of low-dose aspirin have attempted to characterize the clinical benefit (blue line) and risk (red dashed lines) of aspirin therapy by the baseline cardiovascular risks of enrolled populations. However, the clinical risk-benefit threshold, that is, the baseline cardiovascular risk at which the benefit of aspirin therapy exceeds the risk, remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk. CV indicates cardiovascular.

### Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: current knowledge and future research needs [^115VNCAi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention, among a very wide range of survivors of prior occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and those suffering acute myocardial infarction (MI) or occlusive stroke, aspirin decreases risks of MI, stroke, and CVD death. In these high risk patients, the absolute benefits are large and absolute risks are far smaller so aspirin should be more widely prescribed. In contrast, in primary prevention, aspirin reduces risks of first MI but the evidence on stroke and CVD death remain inconclusive. Based on the current totality of evidence from predominantly low risk subjects where the absolute benefits is low and side effects the same as in secondary prevention, any decision to prescribe aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment by the healthcare provider that weighs the absolute benefit in reducing the risk of a first MI against the absolute risk of major bleeding. If the ongoing trials of intermediate risks subjects show net benefits then general guidelines may be justified with several caveats. First, any decision to use aspirin should continue to be made by the healthcare provider. Second, therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of life saving benefit such as statins should be considered with aspirin as an adjunct, not alternative. The more widespread and appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention is particularly attractive, especially in developing countries where CVD is emerging as the leading cause of death. In addition, aspirin is generally widely available over the counter and is extremely inexpensive.

### Strategies for primary and secondary stroke prevention [^111pEx9S]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Of the 55 million deaths that occur annually, 1 in 10 is attributable to stroke. As a consequence, cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and stroke is among the most devastating consequences of vascular disease, causing long-term disability and incurring high personal, societal, and financial costs. However, stroke is a highly preventable disease in the majority of patients. The goal of stroke prevention strategies is to identify high-risk patients through the presence of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and to target these modifiable risk factors through the use of appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Clinical and epidemiologic studies point toward three major risk-reducing pharmacologic therapies that together may dramatically reduce stroke risk. First, landmark clinical trials have demonstrated that the reduction of blood pressure in persons at risk for cerebrovascular disease significantly reduces stroke risk. Second, ample evidence supports the use of antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, in patients at high risk for a cerebrovascular event. Third, an abundance of data suggests that lipid-lowering therapy with a statin reduces stroke risk in most moderate- to high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Together, these data suggest that intensive therapy with agents from multiple drug classes that target two or more risk factors for cerebrovascular disease may provide additive-or even synergistic-reductions in stroke risk.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^11273tu4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

### Antiplatelet use in ischemic stroke [^117DgjRk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Although there is good evidence for the efficacy of aspirin as both an acute treatment for ischemic stroke and secondary prevention, it is not licensed as a primary prevention agent for stroke in the United Kingdom. Although aspirin is not licensed for this indication in the United Kingdom, it is recommended by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) as a primary preventative agent in cardiovascular disease, including stroke, in patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk score of above 10% (level IIa evidence). A 2020 meta-analysis of 157 054 participants across 11 studies examined the risk of stroke in patients without cardiovascular disease who were taking 75 to 500 mg of aspirin daily as primary prevention. The studies included patients varying from low to moderate risk of cardiovascular disease, with risk factors including hypertension and diabetes, who were followed up for at least 1 year. Although aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction, there was no reduction in nonfatal strokes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.85–1.04), nor in cardiovascular mortality rates. However, there was an increased risk of hemorrhagic strokes (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06–1.56, number needed to harm [NNH] = 8333) and of major gastrointestinal bleeds in those taking aspirin (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.43–2.35, NNH = 2040). These data suggest that the place for aspirin treatment in stroke is secondary prevention rather than primary prevention.

Effect of treatments for stroke and prevention of stroke in men and women

Primary prevention with aspirin

The use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is no longer advised in many guidelines. However, the Women's Health Study suggested a beneficial effect of aspirin in risk of stroke in women. This topic has recently been addressed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomised controlled clinical trials (135,641 participants). Differences in the effect of aspirin on primary stroke prevention were evident between men and women. A significant reduction in the risk of stroke was observed with aspirin therapy in women (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99, p = 0.03), driven by a decreased risk of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93, p = 0.008). There was a nonsignificant increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.19, p = 0.29) with aspirin in women. In contrast, aspirin therapy did not significantly alter ischaemic stroke risk in males (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.32, p = 0.72) but increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.03, p = 0.05). Aspirin therapy increased risk of major bleeding in both men and women, although a significant increase in risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin was only seen in women. There were also sex-based differences in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) with aspirin treatment. There was no reduction in the risk of MI in women (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11, p = 0.38) but there was a significant reduction in men (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.81, p < 0.0001).

These differential effects of aspirin in men and women may be attributable to underlying differences in platelet function influenced by the actions of sex hormones. For example, platelet function is known to be influenced by testosterone and changes of the ovarian cycle. Overall, the net value of aspirin as a primary preventative agent remains debatable, with the protective benefit of aspirin in women at least partially offset by the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, it is important to note that many trials of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease were conducted before primary prevention with blood pressure reduction and lipid lowering were commonplace.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^112id9hc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.

Purpose

To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes?

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

Data Synthesis

New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased.

Limitations

New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability.

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.

Trial data are mixed: in SPS3, adding clopidogrel to aspirin showed no benefit (risk of recurrent stroke, 3.1% versus 3.3%; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.61–1.37]), whereas in a CHANCE subgroup already on aspirin, adding clopidogrel reduced recurrent stroke (12.3%–9.0%; HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47–0.92]). A prospective registry found higher recurrence with maintaining aspirin (8.0%) compared with switching to another antiplatelet (6.9%) or adding another antiplatelet (6.6%).

### Aspirin nonresponse in patients with arterial causes of ischemic stroke: considerations in detection and management [^113fHjQm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at risk for recurrent ischemic events in the same or different vascular bed. Due to the central role of platelets in the spectrum of ischemic events in all vascular beds, antiplatelet therapy is a critical component of treatment. Of all antiplatelet therapies approved for the secondary prevention of stroke, aspirin is the most well-established and is recommended for all patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease. However, some patients do not respond to aspirin therapy and are termed "aspirin-resistant". This review discusses issues of, and possible solutions to, decreased platelet response to aspirin in patients with arterial causes of ischemic stroke.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^116fTzCJ]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the benefit-risk ratio of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD with a particular focus on subgroups.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD versus control and including at least 1000 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and net clinical benefit. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Subgroup analyses involving sex, concomitant statin treatment, diabetes, and smoking were performed.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trials comprising 164,225 patients were included. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was similar for aspirin and control groups (RR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–1.02; RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90–1.08; respectively). Aspirin reduced the relative risk (RRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 9% (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.95), myocardial infarction by 14% (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.95), and ischemic stroke by 10% (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), but was associated with a 46% relative risk increase of major bleeding events (RR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30–1.64) compared with controls. Aspirin use did not translate into a net clinical benefit adjusted for event-associated mortality risk (mean 0.034%; 95% CI, − 0.18 to 0.25%). There was an interaction for aspirin effect in three patient subgroups: (i) in patients under statin treatment, aspirin was associated with a 12% RRR of MACE (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), and this effect was lacking in the no-statin group; (ii) in non-smokers, aspirin was associated with a 10% RRR of MACE (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), and this effect was not present in smokers; and (iii) in males, aspirin use resulted in a 11% RRR of MACE (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95), with a non-significant effect in females.

Conclusions

Aspirin use does not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and results in an insufficient benefit-risk ratio for CVD primary prevention. Non-smokers, patients treated with statins, and males had the greatest risk reduction of MACE across subgroups.

### A meta-analysis of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the context of contemporary preventive strategies [^1167CoXX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases remains controversial, particularly in the context of contemporary aggressive preventive strategies.

Methods

Relevant randomized clinical trials were included, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Additional moderator analyses were performed to compare the pooled treatment effects from recent trials (those reported after the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel were published in 2001; thus, conducted on the background of contemporary preventive strategies) to the results of older trials.

Results

Data from 14 randomized controlled trials involving 164,751 patients were included. Aspirin use decreased myocardial infarction risk by 16% compared with placebo (RR 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.94); however, in the moderator analyses, aspirin was not associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in recent trials, but was in older trials (P-interaction = .02). Overall, aspirin use significantly increased the occurrence of major bleeding (RR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32–1.69) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54). In moderator analyses, the risk of major bleeding (P-interaction = .12) or hemorrhagic stroke (P-interaction = .44) with aspirin was not significantly different between the older and new trials. Differences between aspirin and placebo in the risks for all-cause stroke, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality were not found.

Conclusions

In the context of contemporary primary prevention guidelines, the effect of aspirin on myocardial infarction risk was significantly attenuated, whereas its major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke complications were retained. Therefore, in contemporary practice, routine use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events may have a net harmful effect.

Secondary stroke prevention — single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) criteria are not met is supported as follows: For those who do not meet DAPT clinical criteria, SAPT is recommended, and comparative trials report mixed advantages among agents; for example, ProFESS found no difference for aspirin–dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, ESPRIT/ESPS2 suggested aspirin–dipyridamole may be slightly more effective than aspirin alone and that aspirin is more effective than placebo, and CAPRIE found fewer events with clopidogrel versus aspirin overall without stroke-subgroup benefit. In lacunar stroke, a pooled analysis suggested evaluated antiplatelets were similarly effective versus placebo. Aspirin dosing may be guided by weight-based data from primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — aspirin 75–100 mg for patients weighing < 70 kg and higher doses for those > 70 kg — though similar studies have not been performed for secondary stroke prevention.

### Risk of hemorrhagic stroke with aspirin use: an update [^111V5cGG]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin is an important therapeutic option in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke, especially in light of its unique cost-effectiveness and widespread availability. In addition, based on the results of a number of large studies, aspirin is also widely used in the primary prevention of MI. This review provides an update of the available data to offer greater clarity regarding the risks of aspirin with respect to hemorrhagic stroke, as well as insights regarding patient selection to minimize the risk of this complication.

Summary Of Review

In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ischemic events, the evidence supports that the benefits of aspirin treatment significantly outweigh the risk of a major hemorrhage. The evidence from primary prevention of MI studies, including that from the recent Women's Health Study evaluation of aspirin use in healthy women, demonstrate that the increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke is small, is comparable to the secondary prevention studies, and fails to achieve statistical significance. A reasonable estimate of the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of aspirin in primary prevention patients is 0.2 events per 1000 patient-years, which is comparable to estimates of the risk associated with the use of aspirin in secondary prevention patients.

Conclusions

When considering whether aspirin is appropriate, the absolute therapeutic cardiovascular benefits of aspirin must be balanced with the possible risks associated with its use, with the most serious being hemorrhagic stroke.

### Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: is more platelet inhibition the answer? [^115CSEkX]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent cerebrovascular events constitute an estimated 200,000 of the 700,000 strokes reported annually in the United States, which makes secondary stroke prevention an important goal in the management of disease among patients who have experienced stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Methods and Results

Various pharmacological approaches have been advocated, but the relative efficacy and safety of these regimens has remained the subject of much debate. The results of recent clinical trials on the use of antiplatelet therapy suggest that patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack may constitute a population distinct from patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease. This may be caused, in part, by the differing etiologies of stroke and the increased vulnerability of cerebral vessels to bleeding. Indeed, dual antiplatelet therapy, which has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, does not confer secondary stroke protection. The emerging paradigm is that some level of platelet inhibition is required for secondary stroke protection; a level beyond which increased risk of bleeding arises.

Conclusions

Because the vast majority of patients with ischemic stroke have recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack, rather than myocardial infarction, as their next event, antiplatelet therapies for these patients should be administered according to what has been shown to be efficacious for secondary stroke protection rather than for myocardial protection. Combination therapies, which provide optimal platelet inhibition as well as vascular protection, may offer the best strategy for secondary stroke protection.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of stroke and other major vascular events… [^115dfqLh]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Aspirin therapy reduces stroke by about 25% for persons with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the effect in those without clinically apparent vascular disease is distinctly different. Objective To define the effect of aspirin use on stroke and other major vascular events when given for primary prevention to persons without clinically recognized vascular disease. Conclusions The effect of aspirin therapy on stroke differs between individuals based on the presence or absence of overt vascular disease, in contrast with the consistent reduction in myocardial infarction by aspirin therapy observed in all populations. We hypothesize that the effect of aspirin therapy on stroke for persons with major risk factors for vascular disease may be intermediate between a substantial decrease for those with manifest vascular disease and a possible small increase for healthy persons due to accentuated intracranial hemorrhage.

When aspirin is given for primary prevention of vascular events, available data support using 75 to 81 mg/d. The regular use of aspirin reduces the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death for patients with clinically manifest vascular disease. An influential meta-analysis of over 100 randomized clinical trials involving more than 60, 000 participants showed that aspirin therapy reduces stroke by about 25% in most high-risk patients. 8 Paradoxically, aspirin use was associated with small increases in the incidences of stroke in 2 large clinical trials of primary prevention included in this meta-analysis although these results were not statistically significant. 8–10. An estimated 8 million elderly Americans without apparent vascular disease consume aspirin regularly, 11 and its effect on stroke in such persons is important to characterize.

With the recent publication of 4 studies addressing the effect of aspirin use on stroke in low-risk persons, 11–14 we undertook a critical review of this issue. Our objectives were to determine the effect of the regular use of aspirin on stroke for persons without clinically manifest atherosclerotic vascular disease as well as its effect on other major vascular events in this population. Hence, a 35% increase in the rate of hemorrhagic stroke by aspirin therapy would raise the overall stroke rate of aspirin users by about 3% to 5% — accounting theoretically for the small trends in excess stroke observed among those assigned aspirin in the pooled analysis of primary prevention trials, assuming no reduction in the incidence of ischemic strokes occurred in those given aspirin therapy.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115tuZES]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths. Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. (D recommendation).

Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies

The 2024 Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Stroke emphasizes the judicious and intentional use of antithrombotic and anticoagulant agents for stroke prevention. In contrast to the 2014 Stroke Prevention Guideline that provided a Class 2a recommendation (reasonable) for the utilization of aspirin therapy among individuals without clinical CVD who had a 10-year risk ≥ 10% or those with diabetes, the 2019 Primary Prevention of CVD Guidelineprovided a 2b recommendation (uncertain) for the utilization of aspirin therapy in those without prior CVD, including diabetes and/or other traditional risk factors. While observational evidence suggests that individuals with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis, and/or elevated lipoprotein(a), may derive net benefit (CVD risk reduction benefit outweighing risk of major bleeding) from primary prevention aspirin therapy, there are limited data specific for the primary prevention of stroke unlike for coronary heart disease (CHD). Class 3 recommendations (harm) for primary prevention aspirin therapy are provided for individuals with CKD and those ≥ 70 years of age without atherosclerotic CVD.

Newly added to the 2024 Guideline is a 2b recommendation for the use of ticagrelor as a dual antiplatelet agent beyond 12 months, and up to 3 years, in addition to aspirin, for the prevention of ischemic stroke in those with stable CHD with low bleeding risk. This recommendation is derived from the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 54) trial, where individuals with a history of myocardial infarction on background aspirin therapy randomized to receive 60 mg ticagrelor vs placebo experienced a 15% relative risk reduction of stroke (1.47% vs 1.94%). However, there was at least a 2.3-fold higher risk of major bleeding events (2.3% vs 1.1%) and a 2.8-fold higher risk of dyspnea (15.8% vs 6.4%) among individuals randomized to receive ticagrelor vs placebo.

### Aspirin-free strategies in cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke prevention [^111cpyeN]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

In patients with manifestations of cardiovascular disease, acetylsalicylic acid (popularly known as aspirin) has been the mainstay of treatment for decades owing to its capacity to reduce the risk of ischaemic events. Accordingly, novel antithrombotic therapies have been traditionally tested on a background of acetylsalicylic acid therapy. Although the adjunctive use of such antithrombotic therapies can potentially further reduce the risk of ischaemic events, these agents are also inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. However, acetylsalicylic acid also increases the risk of bleeding, challenging the paradigm that this agent should remain the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment when alternative antithrombotic agents are also used. Many antithrombotic compounds are characterized by increased potency and consistent efficacy, which might lessen the need for concomitant acetylsalicylic acid. Accordingly, numerous investigations are testing the hypothesis that acetylsalicylic acid-sparing regimens based on newer antithrombotic agents might have an increased net benefit for individual patients owing to the reduction in bleeding risk, without a trade-off in efficacy. This Review summarizes the state of the art relating to antithrombotic approaches with and without acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke. Discussion of the scientific rationale, from bench to bedside, for ongoing studies of acetylsalicylic acid-free pharmacological strategies is included.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. 1 Reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality have been achieved by reducing risk factor exposure with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including use of aspirin. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Aspirin has been demonstrated to prevent a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke among individuals at high risk 12, 13 and to be cost‐effective. 16, 17 It also decreases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death among individuals who have already experienced an MI or stroke. 14, 15

Regular aspirin use for primary prevention (PP) of CVD has been evaluated in multiple well‐designed clinical trials. In 1989, the Physician's Health Study reported a 44% reduction in risk of a first MI for male participants who received aspirin. 12 Regular aspirin use led to a 24% reduction in risk for ischemic stroke in women as demonstrated in the Women's Health Study in 2005. 13 These studies and others 18, 19, 20 led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 to develop a class A recommendation for PP aspirin use in men aged 45 to 79 years and women aged 55 to 79 years for whom CVD ischemic event prevention outweighs bleeding risk. 21 This recommendation provided a distinctly favorable recommendation for aspirin use compared with the 2002 statement. The 2009 recommendation also offered specific benefit/risk guidance tables to facilitate the use of aspirin for PP, compared with the 2002 statement, which only recommended a discussion between clinicians and patients at increased risk for CVD ischemic events. Contemporary studies of PP aspirin use in low‐risk cohorts (eg, the Japanese Primary Prevention Project 22) have since demonstrated similar reductions in a first MI. A recent systematic review analyzed 11 PP aspirin trials completed in the past 3 decades. The meta‐analysis demonstrated a significant 22% reduction in nonfatal MI (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.87). 23

The balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in primary prevention is far less clear than in secondary prevention; further data from randomized trials of individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk are needed.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease. We have assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials (95,000 individuals at low average risk, 660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events) and 16 secondary prevention trials (17,000 individuals at high average risk, 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events) that compared long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

Findings

In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), due mainly to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18%vs 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20%vs 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04%vs 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16%vs 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19%vs 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10%vs 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), and the main risk factors for coronary disease were also risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7%vs 8.2% per year, p < 0.0001), with a non-significant increase in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a fifth in total stroke (2.08%vs 2.54% per year, p = 0.002) and in coronary events (4.3%vs 5.3% per year, p < 0.0001). In both primary and secondary prevention trials, the proportional reductions in the aggregate of all serious vascular events seemed similar for men and women.

Interpretation

In primary prevention without previous disease, aspirin is of uncertain net value as the reduction in occlusive events needs to be weighed against any increase in major bleeds. Further trials are in progress.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114DBJ9A]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding risk factors and aspirin dosing: The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age, and other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure; certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding. The benefits of aspirin for CVD prevention appear similar for low dose (≤ 100 mg/d) and for all doses studied in CVD prevention trials (50 to 500 mg/d), and a pragmatic approach would be to use 81 mg/d, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the US.

### Aspirin in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease: past and current perspectives and future directions [^114UB78W]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention among a wide range of patients who have survived a prior occlusive vascular event, as well as during acute myocardial infarction and acute occlusive stroke, aspirin produces statistically significant and clinically important reductions in the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death. In primary prevention, aspirin reduces risk of a first myocardial infarction, but the data on stroke and vascular deaths remain inconclusive. In addition, the average absolute risk of subjects randomized in the primary prevention trials was so low that it is not possible to get reliable estimates of the benefit-to-risk ratio in primary prevention in subjects at moderate risk. Until the results of ongoing trials are available, nobody would disagree that a nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke is more likely to be disabling than a nonfatal bleed. Thus, in primary prevention at present, the appropriate and judicious use of aspirin by clinicians based on individual clinical judgments that weigh their absolute benefits against the absolute risks of the drug, will avoid premature morbidity and possibly, mortality.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials [^1138fSMF]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke on the basis of trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major stroke is very high for only the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated.

Methods

Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, stratified by severity of baseline neurological deficit, to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this differs by severity at baseline.

Findings

We pooled data for 15 778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an ischaemic stroke vs 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·32–0·55, p < 0·0001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 vs 110 of 7326; 0·29, 0·20–0·42, p < 0·0001), with greatest benefit noted in patients presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0–2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·02–0·31, p = 0·0004; at 0–6 weeks, 14 vs 60 participants, 0·19, 0·11–0·34, p < 0·0001). The effect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·42, 0·26–0·70, p = 0·0007). These effects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6–12 weeks, but there was no benefit after 12 weeks (stroke risk OR 0·97, 0·84–1·12, p = 0·67; severity mRS shift OR 1·00, 0·77–1·29, p = 0·97). By contrast, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 0·90, 95% CI 0·65–1·25, p = 0·53; mRS shift OR 0·90, 0·37–1·72, p = 0·99), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (0·76, 0·63–0·92, p = 0·005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0·64, 0·49–0·84, p = 0·0010). We pooled data for 40 531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline deficits, and was substantial by the second day after starting treatment (2–3 day HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·25–0·57, p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Our findings confirm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention. The considerable early benefit from aspirin warrants public education about self-administration after possible TIA. The previously unrecognised effect of aspirin on severity of early recurrent stroke, the diminishing benefit with longer-term use, and the contrasting time course of effects of dipyridamole have implications for understanding mechanisms of action.

### Antithrombotics for secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke [^111wb8pa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is more effective than anticoagulation for the prevention of noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke. The choice of antiplatelet regimen, however, remains contentious. Recent controversies regarding aspirin resistance and the optimal dosing of aspirin, as well as recognition of the variable bioactivation of clopidogrel, have added further confusion to the debate. The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) recently released their third joint guideline in the past 5 years on secondary stroke prevention. The European Stroke Organisation has published three guidelines on this issue since 2000. These frequent updates have been necessary because of rapidly accumulating data from clinical trials. Careful consideration of the sometimes confusing trial results reveals that the 2011 AHA-ASA guidelines are correct in no longer specifying a 'preferred' antiplatelet regimen from among the choices recently studied. This recommendation does not, however, mean that all antiplatelet regimens should be considered equal. This Review discusses the various antiplatelet regimens, and the trials that led to the rapid evolution of the guidelines for secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^116dUH7x]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the general population, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's guideline recommends aspirin for patients based on age and prediction tools such as the 10-year cardiovascular disease calculator. Importantly, these recommendations are given with a moderate evidence level (B and C). The 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines acknowledge the controversy of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD, but state that aspirin might be considered in selected adults aged 40 to 70 who are at higher CV risk but at no increased bleeding risk. Additionally, two cost-utility analyses suggest a clear benefit of aspirin. However, the ESC guidelines on CVD prevention do not recommend the general use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Limitations

The main limitation is that some studies did not differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. In such cases, the total of "all strokes" was included. The primary endpoint and follow-up periods also differed between some studies; we have adjusted for this in the sensitivity analyses. Another limitation of this meta-analysis was the use of heterogeneous definitions of major bleeding. One study used the GUSTO bleeding classification; most others used a prespecified composite of bleeding events such as GI bleeding and major extracranial bleeding and defined their severity by hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, surgery, transfusion requirement, or fatality. The severity and definition of GI bleeding events were often not further detailed.

Furthermore, some trials included in our meta-analysis were performed several decades ago. Since then, there may have been changes in medical standards, the prevalence of risk factors, and access to early diagnostic services.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular Events [^115G1jj5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain debatable.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical outcomes with aspirin for primary prevention of CVD after the recent publication of large trials adding > 45,000 individuals to the published data.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes with aspirin versus control for primary prevention with follow-up duration of ≥ 1 year were included. Efficacy outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and major adverse cardiovascular events. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, fatal bleeding, and major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Random effects DerSimonian-Laird risk ratios (RRs) for outcomes were calculated.

Results

A total of 15 randomized controlled trials including 165,502 participants (aspirin n = 83,529, control n = 81,973) were available for analysis. Compared with control, aspirin was associated with similar all-cause death (RR: 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93 to 1.01), CV death (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.00), and non-CV death (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.05), but a lower risk of nonfatal MI (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.94), TIA (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.89), and ischemic stroke (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.95). Aspirin was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.33 to 1.69), intracranial bleeding (RR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.55), and major GI bleeding (RR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.73), with similar rates of fatal bleeding (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.55) compared with the control subjects. Total cancer and cancer-related deaths were similar in both groups within the follow-up period of the study.

Conclusions

Aspirin for primary prevention reduces nonfatal ischemic events but significantly increases nonfatal bleeding events.
