## Question

Microscopic hematuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate microscopic hematuria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true microscopic hematuria and ensuring specimen quality. Then, I should verify transient benign causes and the core elements of the initial clinical assessment. Next, I will risk-stratify for malignancy and map diagnostic testing to risk level. After that, I should examine the role and limits of urine cytology and tumor markers. Then, I will define follow-up for negative evaluations and persistent hematuria. I also need to consider special populations, implementation barriers, and cost/radiation trade-offs. Finally, I will summarize the decision algorithm and ensure internal consistency with current guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis precisely, because a positive dipstick alone is insufficient and can lead to unnecessary testing if not verified with microscopy showing ≥ 3 RBCs/hpf, which anchors the AUA/SUFU 2025 framework for microhematuria and is too often omitted in practice, with about 31% of positive dipsticks not followed by confirmatory microscopy, a gap that I should explicitly flag for quality improvement [^114JkbXq] [^116JNmwu].

> Wait, let me verify specimen integrity, especially in women, because contamination drives false positives; limiting squamous epithelial cells to ≤ 2 per hpf on the referral urinalysis meaningfully increases the positive predictive value for true microhematuria and may justify repeating or obtaining a catheterized sample when contamination is suspected, improving diagnostic specificity at the outset.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I exclude transient benign causes that should defer evaluation; recent vigorous exercise, active UTI, current or recent menstruation, and viral illness can all explain hematuria without requiring immediate imaging or cystoscopy, so I should treat or wait, then repeat urinalysis when these conditions resolve before labeling microhematuria as persistent [^117DFb2D].

> Next, I should review the initial clinical assessment elements that inform risk: a focused history including smoking and occupational exposures, prior pelvic radiation or cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide, family history including Lynch syndrome and RCC syndromes, blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess for medical renal disease or nephrology indications, because these variables feed directly into malignancy risk stratification and testing selection in AUA/SUFU 2025 [^117DFb2D].

> I will now examine risk stratification, since the AUA/SUFU 2025 guideline categorizes patients as low/negligible, intermediate, or high risk to match test intensity with malignancy probability; low/negligible risk includes non-smokers with 3–10 RBC/hpf and no other risk factors, intermediate risk includes age and exposure thresholds or 11–25 RBC/hpf, and high risk includes males ≥ 60 years, > 30 pack-years, > 25 RBC/hpf, or a history of gross hematuria, with an explicit caution that women should not be labeled high risk by age alone.

> But wait, what if there is a strong hereditary signal; I need to ensure that patients with a family history of renal cell carcinoma, a genetic renal tumor syndrome, or suspected Lynch syndrome get upper tract imaging regardless of other risk features, because the pretest probability framework changes in these settings and guidelines call for imaging independent of routine risk tiers [^113QSzZ9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the AUA approach mandated CT urography for all microhematuria, but I should double-check this; that generalized CTU recommendation reflects older or alternative frameworks rather than the 2025 risk-adapted pathway, which endorses ultrasound plus cystoscopy for intermediate risk and reserves CTU for high risk, correcting my earlier assumption and better balancing detection with radiation and cost concerns [^113n7Gwo] [^117DFb2D] [^112MZhiB].

> Let me think about low/negligible-risk patients first; the preferred move is to repeat urinalysis within 6 months rather than immediate cystoscopy or imaging, then reclassify based on persistence or degree of hematuria, acknowledging that many such patients — especially low-risk never-smoking women under 50 with fewer than 25 RBC/hpf — have extremely low malignancy risk where evaluation can do more harm than good and shared decision-making about discontinuing further workup is reasonable [^111QMmz7] [^115HdPpN] [^114ToD7A] [^111xBpaj].

> I should confirm the intermediate-risk workup next; cystoscopy plus renal and bladder ultrasound is guideline-concordant and strikes the right balance of detection without CT radiation, and while some patients may seek to avoid cystoscopy, using urine cytology or validated urine markers in that context requires careful counseling about the risk of missing lesions and must still be paired with renal/bladder ultrasound to avoid under-imaging the upper tract [^112MZhiB] [^112K99jT].

> Hold on, I should verify the high-risk pathway; these patients warrant cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with CT urography, given its high sensitivity and specificity for upper tract urothelial carcinoma, while I remain mindful of downstream costs from incidental findings and consider MRI urography or reduced contrast exposure strategies if CTU is contraindicated or renal function is marginal [^114cVMKz] [^111xfM7J] [^113n7Gwo] [^117Lk9ip] [^115rkqFL].

> Next, I should review urine cytology and tumor markers, because routine use at initial evaluation is discouraged across risk categories due to low sensitivity and low cancer prevalence; negative cytology does not exclude malignancy, atypia may still require further evaluation, and serial cytology adds minimal diagnostic yield, so cytology is reserved for high-risk scenarios with equivocal cystoscopy, persistent irritative symptoms, or CIS risk after a negative evaluation [^111aLfmk] [^117Xw92T] [^117QiiXn] [^114N69ay] [^115vWpps].

> Let me consider emerging noninvasive alternatives carefully; methylation marker panels and combinations like TWIST1/ONECUT2/OTX1 demonstrate high sensitivity and negative predictive value in hematuria cohorts, and integrating risk scores such as HCRS with Oncuria-Detect can further enhance NPV in microhematuria, though I should caution that these tools currently complement, not replace, guideline-directed cystoscopic and imaging pathways in appropriately risked patients [^112LQoeX] [^113yGu6D].

> I should confirm follow-up strategies now; for low-risk patients, repeating urinalysis at 6 months is standard with potential discharge if negative and shared decision-making thereafter, while intermediate-risk patients who deferred cystoscopy based on markers require repeat urinalysis at 12 months and cystoscopy if hematuria persists, and for intermediate/high-risk patients with a negative evaluation, repeat urinalysis at about 12 months with reappraisal of risk if hematuria continues is prudent [^111QMmz7] [^notfound] [^112YRYTT] [^112tL1bY] [^115HdPpN] [^111xBpaj].

> Let me reconsider nephrology triggers and long-term kidney risk; microscopic hematuria accompanied by proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, casts, hypertension, or elevated creatinine should prompt nephrology referral, and in younger patients with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria, the risk of future CKD is nontrivial due to underlying glomerular diseases, so periodic blood pressure, urinalysis, and kidney function monitoring makes sense even when urologic evaluation is negative [^116SrBWt] [^112Y6La1] [^112PYwCc].

> Next, I should review special populations methodically; women have lower baseline malignancy rates and more confounders like pelvic organ prolapse and interstitial cystitis, supporting a more conservative approach in low-risk subgroups, children often have glomerular or metabolic etiologies and warrant nephrology cues when proteinuria or casts are present, blunt trauma with isolated microscopic hematuria does not require bladder imaging, and pregnancy mandates radiation-sparing strategies with many cases representing benign and transient findings on confirmation [^116tHED8] [^114ToD7A] [^115zk8e5] [^112godnC] [^1119aojP] [^1135W7KT] [^116gpqSn].

> I should double-check practice gaps and implementation issues; confirmatory microscopy is frequently omitted, most patients with confirmed microhematuria receive no further evaluation, CTU overuse generates costly incidental findings, and standardized, Delphi-informed pathways, risk scoring and biomarkers at the primary care level, and embedded decision support can improve adherence and reduce both under- and over-testing [^116JNmwu] [^117Lk9ip] [^112PYwCc] [^113yGu6D].

> Hold on, I should verify that our approach aligns with cancer-presenting symptoms guidance; painless hematuria deserves evaluation given its link to bladder cancer presentation, reinforcing why cystoscopy anchors intermediate and high-risk pathways despite limitations of cytology and the need to tailor upper tract imaging by risk and contraindications [^112AjDdC] [^112MZhiB] [^111aLfmk].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the decision sequence is coherent: confirm true microscopic hematuria with high-quality microscopy after excluding transient causes; stratify malignancy risk with clinical factors; for low/negligible risk, repeat urinalysis in 6 months and re-stratify if persistent; for intermediate risk, perform cystoscopy with renal/bladder ultrasound or, if cystoscopy is deferred after counseling, use urine markers or cytology plus ultrasound with planned follow-up; for high risk, perform cystoscopy plus CT urography unless contraindicated; avoid routine cytology except in defined high-risk scenarios; and set rational follow-up intervals using shared decision-making once a negative evaluation is documented [^116SrBWt] [^111QMmz7] [^112MZhiB] [^112K99jT] [^114cVMKz] [^111aLfmk] [^111xBpaj].

Microscopic hematuria is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** [^114cVMKz] on a properly collected, centrifuged urine specimen confirmed by microscopy [^114JkbXq]. The initial evaluation includes a focused history, physical exam, blood pressure, and serum creatinine [^116SrBWt] to assess for malignancy risk, medical renal disease, and benign causes. Risk stratification guides **management** [^114N69ay], with low/negligible-risk patients needing only repeat urinalysis within 6 months [^111QMmz7]; intermediate-risk patients requiring cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB]; and high-risk patients needing cystoscopy and CT urography [^117DFb2D]. Urine cytology or tumor markers are not routine [^111aLfmk] but may be considered [^112K99jT] in select intermediate- or high-risk cases [^114N69ay]. Persistent hematuria following a negative workup warrants **annual urinalysis**, blood pressure, and renal function monitoring [^112Y6La1], with re-evaluation if hematuria persists or risk status changes [^115HdPpN].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Microscopic hematuria is the presence of **three or more red blood cells per high-power field (RBCs/hpf)** [^114cVMKz] in a properly collected, centrifuged urine specimen, confirmed by microscopy [^114JkbXq]. Proper specimen collection is critical to avoid **contamination and false positives**, particularly in women; catheterized samples contain significantly fewer RBCs and squamous epithelial cells than voided samples [^114JkbXq].

---

## Clinical significance and risk stratification

Microscopic hematuria may reflect benign or serious conditions, including malignancy, nephrolithiasis, infection, or glomerular disease [^111xfM7J]. Risk stratification is essential to guide **evaluation and management**, balancing diagnostic yield with potential harms and costs [^113RAdLf]. The 2025 guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine & Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) recommend **categorizing patients as low/negligible, intermediate, or high risk** based on age, smoking history, RBC count, and other risk factors [^114cVMKz].

| **Risk category** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Low/negligible | - Age < 40 years <br/> - Never-smoker <br/> - 3–10 RBC/hpf <br/> - No risk factors for urothelial cancer [^114cVMKz] |
| Intermediate | - Age 40–59 years <br/> - Smoking 10–30 pack-years <br/> - 11–25 RBC/hpf <br/> - Additional risk factors (e.g. irritative LUTS, prior pelvic radiation, occupational exposures) [^114cVMKz] |
| High | - Age ≥ 60 years <br/> - Smoking > 30 pack-years <br/> - > 25 RBC/hpf <br/> - History of gross hematuria <br/> - Multiple risk factors [^114cVMKz] |

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic workup

The **initial evaluation** of microscopic hematuria includes a focused history, physical examination, blood pressure, and serum creatinine [^116SrBWt] to identify risk factors for malignancy, medical renal disease, and benign causes.

- **Low/negligible-risk patients**: Repeat urinalysis within 6 months [^111QMmz7]; no immediate cystoscopy or imaging.
- **Intermediate-risk patients**: Cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB]; consider urine cytology or validated urine-based tumor markers if patients wish to avoid cystoscopy [^112K99jT].
- **High-risk patients**: Cystoscopy and CT urography [^117DFb2D]; urine cytology may be considered in select cases [^114N69ay].

---

## Role of urine cytology and biomarkers

Urine cytology and biomarkers are **not routinely recommended** [^111aLfmk] in the initial evaluation of microscopic hematuria because of low sensitivity and limited diagnostic utility [^115vWpps]. However, they may be considered for intermediate-risk patients who wish to avoid cystoscopy [^112K99jT] or for high-risk patients with persistent hematuria and equivocal cystoscopic findings [^114N69ay].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Patients with persistent microscopic hematuria following a negative initial evaluation should undergo **annual urinalysis**, blood pressure monitoring, and renal function assessment. Re-evaluation is warranted if hematuria persists or the patient's risk status changes [^115HdPpN].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

The prognosis of microscopic hematuria **varies with the underlying cause and risk stratification** [^114cVMKz]. Low-risk patients generally have a favorable prognosis, whereas high-risk patients have a higher likelihood of malignancy or significant renal disease [^112rdBsK], necessitating thorough evaluation and close follow-up.

---

Microscopic hematuria is defined as ≥ 3 RBCs/hpf [^114cVMKz] on a properly collected urine specimen [^114JkbXq]. The initial evaluation includes history, physical examination, blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine assessment [^116SrBWt]. Risk stratification guides **further evaluation**, with low-risk patients requiring repeat urinalysis [^111QMmz7], intermediate-risk patients undergoing cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB], and high-risk patients receiving cystoscopy and CT urography [^117DFb2D]. Urine cytology and biomarkers are not routinely recommended [^111aLfmk] but may be considered in select cases. Persistent hematuria following a negative evaluation warrants annual monitoring and re-evaluation if risk status changes [^115HdPpN].

### Hematuria and risk for end-stage kidney disease [^112Y6La1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a common clinical finding requiring medical attention and poses several clinical challenges. The main challenge is to predict the future risk for chronic kidney disease, thereby designing a long-term follow-up evaluation and treatment plan. This review focuses on the risk of subsequent end-stage kidney disease among young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria.

Recent findings indicate that young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria have an increased risk for end-stage kidney disease, mainly secondary to primary glomerular diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease, and Alport syndrome. Of these, the association with progression to chronic kidney disease is best established for IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome. Thin basement membrane disease had been considered "benign" by most authors; however, recent findings suggest otherwise. In addition, novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic interventions for these conditions have recently been studied.

Persistent isolated microscopic hematuria confers a risk for future chronic kidney disease, which is dependent on disease context, underlying genetics, environmental interactions, and treatment. "Benign (familial) hematuria" is a misnomer, which we recommend abandoning as it prompts loss to follow-up. Instead, we favor annual/biennial follow-up assessments that should include measurement of blood pressure, urinalysis, and kidney function tests.

### Defining properly collected urine: Thresholds to improve the accuracy of urinalysis for microscopic hematuria evaluation in women [^114JkbXq]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is one of the most common office consults for urologists. While revised guidelines have risk-stratified patients to reduce unnecessary screening, they do not provide guidance concerning specimen quality. This study aimed to define "properly collected" specimens using catheterized urine samples as a reference to improve the utility of hematuria screening in women.

We prospectively acquired voided and catheterized urine samples from 46 women referred for microscopic hematuria from September 2016 to March 2020. Characteristics of pre-referral urinalysis were compared to the matched specimens. True microscopic hematuria was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on catheterization.

Catheterized urinalyses had significantly fewer red blood and squamous epithelial cells in comparison to both referral urinalyses (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively) and same-day void urinalyses (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, respectively). As no catheterized sample had > 2 squamous epithelial cells, this threshold was applied to referral urinalyses for analysis. The addition of this criterion for "properly collected specimen" increased the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses from 46.1% to 68.8% for true microscopic hematuria. Fewer than 2 squamous epithelial cells with elevated RBC was a significant predictor for true microscopic hematuria (p = 0.003).

Voided specimens in the urology clinic had significantly lower red blood cells than referral samples, indicating improved collection technique.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline (2025) [^114cVMKz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

In the AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines, the classification and risk stratification for microhematuria emphasize categorizing patients as low/negligible-, intermediate-, or high-risk for genitourinary malignancy after initial evaluation.

- **Low/negligible risk (meeting all criteria)**: Patients should be non-smokers, have 3–10 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis, be at an age that does not increase risk, and have no established risk factors for urothelial cancer.

- **Intermediate risk (meeting one or more criteria)**: This category includes males aged 40–59 years, individuals with a smoking history of 10–30 pack-years, or those with 11–25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis. Patients previously considered low/negligible risk but showing 3–25 RBC/hpf on a repeat urinalysis without prior evaluation also fall here. Additional risk factors such as irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, prior pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide, family history of urothelial cancer or Lynch syndrome, and occupational exposure to benzene or aromatic amines like rubber, petrochemicals, and dyes can categorize patients as intermediate risk.

- **High risk (meeting one or more criteria)**: Males aged 60 and above, those with a smoking history exceeding 30 pack-years, and findings of > 25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis are significant indicators. A history of gross hematuria or having multiple risk factors for urothelial cancer combined with any high-risk features also places individuals in this category. Notably, females should not be categorized as high-risk solely based on age.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^117Xw92T]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have reported the limitations of urinary cytology in the evaluation of patients with hematuria. Paez and colleagues reported that no tumor could be diagnosed with cytology alone and that a negative cytology could not exclude a malignancy. Because of its limitations, Nabi et al. recommended the judicial use of cytology in the proper clinical context. Similar to the report by Deshpande et al, over 25% of patients with atypical urinary cytology were found to have biopsy-proven cancer. Because of this, atypia may require biopsy to rule out malignancy, closer follow-up, or other urinary-based assays to improve sensitivity, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Our study has several limitations. First, this is a small, retrospective study from a single institution. Not only could biases have been introduced in patient selection and evaluation, but this group may also not represent patients with microscopic hematuria seen by urologists outside of a tertiary care setting or those seen by primary care physicians. Secondly, a paucity of outside medical records were available to review in order to determine how the patients initially were found to have microscopic hematuria, whether they were diagnosed based on history, urine dipstick, or microscopic analysis. Thirdly, other urine-based assays, such as NMP-22 and BTA, also have reduced sensitivity in this cohort. Lastly, there was no standardized follow-up protocol in place to monitor patients with a negative hematuria evaluation to determine possible long-term developments.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^1175PFMw]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) was shown to detect renal cancer with high sensitivity, although 14 cases had false-positive results. In these false-positive cases, a second scan, typically using a renal protocol CT, would be performed to better characterize the renal mass. Thus, the approach to cystoscopy with RBUS instead of computerized tomography urogram (CTU) to investigate the upper tract of patients who present with microscopic hematuria should be the preferred upper tract imaging of choice.

We acknowledge that RBUS has poor sensitivity for identifying renal calculi. Therefore, we propose that patients who present with symptoms suggestive of renal colic, such as flank pain, would benefit from RBUS combined with noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, or CTU. We acknowledge that replacing CTU with RBUS in patients with microscopic hematuria would potentially miss asymptomatic renal calculi when no hydronephrosis is present with microscopic hematuria. We believe that such patients would be uncommon and identifying them would be at the expense of subjecting a high number to CTU, which would yield negative results.

In an ideal world, all patients should be investigated with the best diagnostic test available. However, the risk of adverse events, the low disease incidence in the specific patient cohort, and the high cost of diagnostic testing suggest that this may not be warranted. Cases of microscopic hematuria have a 0% disease-specific incidence of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and are below the 3% threshold for diagnostic investigation used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the 1% suggested by the American Urological Association (AUA).

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^1119aojP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In cases where a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis vary with the underlying disease.

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes.

- **Nonglomerular causes**: Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses.
- **Glomerular causes**: Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis.
- **Painless atraumatic gross hematuria**: This condition in the elderly is considered to be caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise.

A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yield a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### The prevalence of microscopic hematuria in a cohort of women with pelvic organ prolapse [^115zk8e5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In 2012, the American Urological Association (AUA) revised its guidelines for microscopic hematuria (MH). We hypothesize that the prevalence of MH is greater in women with pelvic organ prolapse than in the general population.

- **Methods**: All patients presenting to an outpatient urogynecological center with prolapse between January 2008 and December 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, the presence of gross hematuria, menses, or urological pathology. MH was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on one urinalysis specimen with a negative urine culture, and the prevalence of MH was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed.

- **Results**: One thousand and forty women with pelvic organ prolapse were included in the analysis. Mean age was 64.1 years (range 20 to 96) and mean parity was 2.7 (range 0 to 12). Two hundred and nine out of 1,040 met the criteria for MH. No cases of urological malignancy were diagnosed in patients who underwent further workup. One hundred and ninety-seven patients with MH (93.4%) had cystoceles on examination.

- **Conclusions**: This is the largest study to investigate MH in women with prolapse based on the new guidelines. The prevalence of MH was 20.1% in our study population. Cystoscopy, renal function testing, and CT urography are now recommended after one positive urinalysis, regardless of gender or the presence of prolapse. Owing to the low incidence of urological malignancy detected as well as the increased prevalence of MH found in women with prolapse, specific guidelines for the management are necessary.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^112kL3kt]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Many etiologies exist for microscopic hematuria, such as infection, urolithiasis, benign prostate hyperplasia, malignancy, nephropathies, or physiological factors. About 3.6% of patients presenting with microscopic hematuria will have a urinary tract malignancy; however, the positive predictive value of microhematuria for malignancy is low. Therefore, population screening has not been recommended.

The American Urological Association guidelines define microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells (RBC) per high power field on a properly collected microscopic urinalysis. In contrast, the Canadian Urological Association guidelines require confirmation with a second microscopic urinalysis. In clinical practice, however, microscopy is often not ordered or performed by laboratories. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria; rates of false positives and negatives are low and can be due to hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, ascorbic acid, or reducing agents such as povidone.

Routine screening dipstick urinalysis is currently not recommended by any organization, including the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, as there is insufficient data to support this type of screening. Despite this, up to 50% of general practitioners perform a routine urinalysis on all their patients as part of annual health screening visits. Microscopic hematuria (MH) is a common finding during routine urinalysis and leads to frequent referrals to urologists and nephrologists.

### Prevalence of benign microscopic hematuria among women with interstitial cystitis: Implications for evaluation of genitourinary malignancy [^112godnC]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence of benign microscopic hematuria among a cohort of women with clinical interstitial cystitis (IC), a total of 100 women were prospectively assessed for microscopic hematuria with postvoid sterile catheterization. The evaluation for all patients included urine culture, potassium sensitivity test (PST), cystoscopy with hydrodistension under general anesthesia, and symptom assessment with the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire.

The mean age ± SD was 37 ± 15 years, with no difference noted in those with or without microscopic hematuria (P = 0.71). Microscopic hematuria was present in 24 (24%) of the 100 women. No patient had gross hematuria, positive urine culture, or cystoscopic findings suspicious for malignancy. The mean PUF score was 17 ± 6. The PST was positive in 92 (92%) of 100 women, and 8 patients had only cystoscopic findings diagnostic of IC. The likelihood of a positive PST or positive cystoscopic findings among patients with microscopic hematuria was similar to that of patients without microscopic hematuria. The PST results correlated with the cystoscopic findings (P < 0.001). Of 36 patients with positive cystoscopic findings, 28 (78%) had a positive PST, and 28 (30%) of 92 with a positive PST had positive cystoscopy findings.

In this cohort of women with IC, the prevalence of benign microscopic hematuria was 24%. These data suggest that in women at low risk of genitourinary malignancy who have clinical IC, microscopic hematuria may be an incidental finding.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^111T6N9m]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common incidental finding on routine urinalysis. Although there are no clear recommendations for performing routine urinalysis, some studies have shown that up to 50% of general practitioners continue to perform annual routine urinalysis regardless of age or risk factors. The aim of this study was to identify associated factors and prevalence of dipstick microscopic hematuria in the general male population presenting at an annual public men's health fair.

- **Method**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data at an annual men's health fair from 2008 to 2013. Patient-reported health questionnaires, basic physical exams including digital rectal exams, basic bloodwork, and dipstick urinalysis data were examined.

- **Results**: A total of 979 patients were reviewed. Of these, 850 provided a urine sample and were included in the final analysis. Seventy-three (8.6%) patients had positive hematuria on urinalysis. The average age in both groups was 55 years. The presence of microscopic hematuria was correlated with diabetes and proteinuria, with odds ratios of 2.8 (1.3–5.8) and 2.9 (1.7–5.0) respectively, on multivariate analysis. No significant correlation was identified with age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, body mass index, smoking, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). A limitation of this study is the lack of follow-up and knowledge of subsequent investigations of patients.

- **Conclusion**: Microscopic hematuria is a prevalent condition in the male population presenting to a health fair.

### Commentary: The role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^111MvFsE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Additionally, in the workup of hematuria, microscopic or otherwise, the urologist's job goes beyond ruling out the presence or absence of urinary tract malignancy. Stones, vascular malformations, and inflammatory as well as infectious lesions detectable by cystoscopy may all result in blood in the urine. Furthermore, bladder wash cytology, which has increased sensitivity compared to cytology on voided urine specimens, may be obtained during cystoscopy. This provides additional diagnostic value over voided urine cytology, even when carcinoma in situ (CIS) is missed cystoscopically or radiologically. In sum, voided urine cytology does not eliminate the need for cystoscopy. For similar reasons, voided urine cytology cannot replace radiographic studies, which can detect not only benign lesions but also neoplasms outside the collecting system, such as those in the renal parenchyma.

Voided urine cytology does not appear to have a primary role in the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria but may serve as a supplement to cystoscopy and excretory urography in a minority of cases, for example, when "invisible" diseases such as CIS are suspected. However, hematuria is a "late" detector of bladder cancer, and voided urine cytology is almost never the sole test during a hematuria workup that detects urothelial cancer.

One might argue that in the series by Hofland and Mariani, the urine cytology test was very valuable for the four patients in whom malignancy was solely detected by urine cytology. However, the question arises: for a disease with a rather low prevalence, such as urothelial CIS, is a test with a very small sample size sufficient to justify widespread use?

### Evaluation of an epigenetic profile for the detection of bladder cancer in patients with hematuria [^112LQoeX]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Many patients enter the care cycle with gross or microscopic hematuria and undergo cystoscopy to rule out bladder cancer. The sensitivity of this invasive examination is limited, leaving many patients at risk for undetected cancer. To improve clinical practice, more sensitive and noninvasive screening methods should be applied.

A total of 154 urine samples were collected from patients with hematuria, including 80 without and 74 with bladder cancer. DNA from cells in the urine was epigenetically profiled using two independent assays. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed on TWIST1. SNaPshot™ methylation analysis was done for different loci of OTX1 and ONECUT2. Additionally, all samples were analyzed for mutation status of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), PIK3CA, FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3), HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS.

The combination of TWIST1, ONECUT2 (two loci), and OTX1 resulted in the best overall performing panel. Logistic regression analysis on these methylation markers, mutation status of FGFR3, TERT, and HRAS, and patient age resulted in an accurate model with 97% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.88–0.98). Internal validation led to an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.92. With an estimated bladder cancer prevalence of 5% to 10% in a hematuria cohort, the assay resulted in a 99.6% to 99.9% negative predictive value.

Epigenetic profiling using TWIST1, ONECUT2, and OTX1 results in high sensitivity and specificity. Accurate risk prediction might result in less.

### Committee opinion no. 703: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^114ToD7A]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

The classification and risk stratification for microhematuria, as outlined in the ACOG/AUGS 2017 guidelines, emphasize recognizing the risk of urinary tract malignancy. Specifically, for low-risk, never-smoking females under 50 years old without gross hematuria and with less than 25 RBC/hpf, the likelihood of malignancy is ≤ 0.5%.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112pWPvw]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, institutional review board approval was secured to examine medical records for relevant clinical information from 239 consecutive patients evaluated for microscopic hematuria between January 2003 and August 2005 at a urology outpatient clinic in a tertiary-care inner-city hospital. Microscopic hematuria was defined as the presence of at least three red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf). Initial evaluations encompassed medical history, physical examination, urinalysis, and voided urinary cytology. If there was a high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the cause of hematuria, urine cultures were obtained. The clinic and hospital records were reviewed for several key factors, including tobacco usage, voiding symptoms according to the American Urologic Association (AUA) symptom score, urinalysis, urinary cytology, and cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation, as well as pathological outcomes. The median follow-up was 40 months, ranging from 1 to 66 months.

Based on AUA guideline criteria regarding the use of urinary cytology, voided urinary cytologies were collected over a seven-day period prior to radiologic and cystoscopic evaluations. Of the 239 patients, 182 had one cytology available for review, while 125 and 96 patients had two and three cytologies, respectively, available for evaluation. Consequently, a total of 403 urinary cytologies were reviewed by our cytopathologists. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, the final cytologic testing results were categorized by the cytopathologists into one of four categories: normal, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^112gQG1T]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Patient demographics reveal the study included 3,556 patients with a median age of 68 years (IQR 57–76). The overall incidence of urinary tract cancer was 10.0%, comprising 8.1% bladder cancer, 1.0% renal cancer, and 0.5% UTUC. RBUS was performed in 2,166 patients (60.9%), while CTU was conducted in 1,692 (47.6%). Both RBUS and CTU were performed in 475 patients (13.2%).

- **Urinary tract disease incidence**: The cases of urinary tract cancer and renal stones, stratified by microscopic and macroscopic hematuria presentation, demonstrate that 33 patients (2.7%) investigated for microscopic hematuria had bladder cancer, 5 (0.4%) had renal cancer, and 55 (4.4%) had renal calculi. Notably, no patient with nonvisible hematuria was diagnosed with UTUC.

In comparison, patients with macroscopic hematuria showed a higher incidence of urinary tract disease than those with microscopic hematuria. Among these patients, 255 (11.0%) had bladder cancer, 32 (1.4%) had renal cancer, and 18 (0.8%) were diagnosed with UTUC. Renal calculi were confirmed in 215 patients (9.3%).

### Patterns of outpatient urinalysis testing and the detection of microscopic hematuria [^111HgqqZ]. Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate urinalysis testing patterns within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), estimate the proportion and likelihood of patients who completed a urinalysis to have microscopic hematuria (MH), and explore how urinalysis testing patterns may influence MH detection.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cross-sectional study used VHA data. Adult patients without a known urologic cancer history who had at least one outpatient visit at any VHA site and at least one interpretable urinalysis performed in 2015 were identified. The factors associated with the number of urinalyses performed on each patient and associations with the presence of MH were investigated.

- **Results**: Among 5,719,966 adults, 39% completed a urinalysis. Variation in the proportion of patients who completed urinalyses was highest by age, among patients with hypertension and diabetes, and by region. Of patients who underwent urinalysis and had no prior genitourinary cancer history, 54% did not have an interpretable urinalysis result. Among patients with at least one interpretable microscopic urinalysis, 37% had MH. This was more common among older patients, females, smokers, and patients with more comorbidities. Variation in the likelihood of patients having MH remained after adjusting for multiple factors and when contextualized by urinalysis completion and interpretability patterns.

- **Conclusion**: The number of urinalyses performed in the VHA system is remarkably high. Detection of MH is influenced by the frequency of urinalysis testing and interpretability of results.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^113n7Gwo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a cardinal clinical symptom with an associated risk of urinary tract cancer. The risk of malignancy in patients who present with macroscopic hematuria is 20.4%, while it is 5.2% in patients with microscopic hematuria. Bladder cancer is the most common cancer detected in microscopic hematuria cases, accounting for 4.8% of those investigated. Renal cancer and UTUC are less common, with incidences of 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.

Recommendations on who should be investigated for microscopic hematuria differ across guideline bodies. There is a consensus that cystoscopy remains the investigation of choice to visualize the bladder, but there is a lack of agreement on the optimal upper tract imaging. RBUS and CTU are the most commonly used imaging modalities. The AUA recommends performing CTU for macroscopic and microscopic hematuria, while the United Kingdom's NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the ACP (American College of Physicians®) do not specify a recommended imaging modality. Similarly, the role of upper tract imaging in patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer also differs among guidelines.

CTU has the highest diagnostic performance for identifying upper tract disease. A meta-analysis suggested that CTU achieves 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC. However, the diagnostic performance of CTU should be balanced against the risk due to intravenous contrast medium. Intravenous contrast administration is associated with a 3% risk of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients at high risk.

### Intravenous urography in evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^114DNsA7]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

In 2001, the American Urologic Association Best Practice Policy Panel recommended CT or intravenous urography (IVU) over ultrasonography as the initial imaging modality in patients with asymptomatic microhematuria. Here, we present results of a study initiated many years ago and completed prior to 2001, providing information pertinent to the use of IVU as the initial imaging modality for such patients.

- **Patients and methods**: This study compared the results of IVU and ultrasonography in patients aged 40 and older who were referred to a single urology department for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria between 1994 and 2000. There were 290 patients who agreed to participate by undergoing both ultrasonography and IVU; 247 completed both tests. The study included 81 men and 166 women, with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 40–86 years). Thirty patients (12%) were smokers.

- **Results**: A renal lesion or mass suggestive of a tumor was found in 8 patients (3.2%). Of these, 3 patients had this finding on the IVU examination, and 5 on ultrasonography. None of the patients had such a lesion/mass on both examinations. Two patients with suspect lesions were ultimately diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. Both patients with renal cancer had a suspect lesion on the ultrasound examination but not on the contemporaneous IVU.

- **Conclusion**: Intravenous urography may miss lesions/masses that lead to a diagnosis of upper-tract neoplasia.

### Evaluation of microscopic hematuria and risk of urologic cancer in female patients [^116tHED8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Urologic cancer has a lower prevalence in women compared with men; however, there are no differences in the recommended evaluation for women and men with microscopic hematuria.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with urologic cancer in women with microscopic hematuria and to determine the applicability of a hematuria risk score for women.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study within an integrated healthcare system in Southern California. All urinalyses with microscopic hematuria (> 3 red blood cells per high-power field) performed from 2009–2015 were identified. Women referred for urologic evaluation were entered into a prospective database. Clinical and demographic variables, including the presence of gross hematuria in the preceding 6 months, were recorded. The cause of the hematuria, benign or malignant, was entered into the database. Cancer rates were compared using chi-square and logistic regression models. Adjusted risk ratios of urologic cancer were estimated using multivariate regression analysis. We also explored the applicability of a previously developed, gender nonspecific hematuria risk score in this female cohort.

- **Results**: A total of 2,705,696 urinalyses were performed in women during the study period, of which 552,119 revealed microscopic hematuria. Of these, 14,539 women were referred for urologic evaluation; clinical data for 3573 women were entered into the database. The overall rate of urologic cancer was 1.3% (47/3573).

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by various factors such as urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumors, some of which (e.g. tumors) may be life-threatening. Thus, prompt and thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, the evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography, or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher-grade or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine, making the sample more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has notoriously low sensitivity but extremely high specificity, making it a useful tool for following patients with high-grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be challenging, particularly in conditions such as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises: how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology in patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^114K5iTu]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days. However, several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated and difficult to follow, enabling a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm, resulting in a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to adversely affect patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost, and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, less than 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days, and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days.

### Radiologic evaluation of pediatric blunt renal trauma in patients with microscopic hematuria [^115WbyTt]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

As a result of the rapid increase in medical costs, the efficacy of diagnostic imaging is under examination, and efforts have been made to identify patients who may safely be spared radiographic imaging. We reviewed the records of children who presented to our institution with suspected blunt renal injuries to determine if radiographic evaluation is necessary in children with microscopic hematuria and blunt renal trauma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,200 children (ages less than 18 years) who sustained blunt abdominal trauma and who presented to our Level I pediatric trauma center between 1995 and 1997.

Urinalysis was performed in 299 patients (25%). Urinalysis results were correlated with findings on abdominal computed tomography (CT). All patients had more than three red blood cells per high power field (RBC/hpf) or gross hematuria. Renal injuries were graded according to the injury scale defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma.

Sixty-five patients had microscopic hematuria. Thirty-five (54%) were evaluated with an abdominal CT scan. Three patients sustained significant renal injuries (grade II-V), and 32 patients had normal findings or renal contusions. Therefore, only 3 of 65 patients (4.6%) sustained a significant renal injury. All three patients had other associated major organ injuries. Of the three patients with gross hematuria evaluated with abdominal CT, one (33%) sustained a significant renal injury and had no associated injuries. The degree of hematuria did not correlate with the grade of renal injury.

### Evaluating hematuria: Impact of guideline adherence on urologic cancer diagnosis [^111CefoR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess physician adherence to the 2001 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for evaluating patients with asymptomatic hematuria and its impact on the diagnosis of urologic cancer.

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study of patients with asymptomatic hematuria evaluated in a large academic health center in 2004 (allowing for long-term follow-up), we randomly selected 100 of 1771 patients with asymptomatic hematuria (52 men; mean age 54 years; 58 microscopic, 39 macroscopic, three unknown-type hematuria; median follow-up 89 months, interquartile range 33–97 months). Multivariate logistic regression assessed effects of age, sex, hematuria type, and physician specialty on guideline adherence, the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures were variability in evaluation among physician specialists, and the proportion of patients developing urologic cancer.

Only 36 of 100 patients had a guideline-adherent evaluation, of which 5 were diagnosed with urologic cancer (median 1 month, range 0–11). No urologic cancers were diagnosed in 64 patients with nonadherent evaluations. Only evaluation by a urologist significantly predicted guideline adherence (P < 0.0001). Patients with gross hematuria more often underwent intravenous or computed tomography urography (P = 0.009); urologist evaluation more often led to intravenous or computed tomography urography (P < 0.0001), cystoscopy (P < 0.0001), cytology (P = 0.009), and guideline-adherent evaluation (P < 0.0001).

Although most physicians did not adhere to the guidelines…

### Comparison of the harms, advantages, and costs associated with alternative guidelines for the evaluation of hematuria [^113RAdLf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Existing recommendations for the diagnostic testing of hematuria range from uniform evaluation of varying intensity to patient-level risk stratification. Concerns have been raised about not only the costs and advantages of computed tomography (CT) scans but also the potential harms of CT radiation exposure.

The objective of the study was to compare the advantages, harms, and costs associated with five guidelines for hematuria evaluation.

A microsimulation model was developed to assess each of the following guidelines (listed in order of increasing intensity) for the initial evaluation of hematuria: Dutch, Canadian Urological Association (CUA), Kaiser Permanente (KP), Hematuria Risk Index (HRI), and American Urological Association (AUA). Participants comprised a hypothetical cohort of patients (n = 100,000) with hematuria aged 35 years or older. This study was conducted from August 2017 through November 2018.

- **Exposures**: Under the Dutch and CUA guidelines, patients received cystoscopy and ultrasonography if they were 50 years or older (Dutch) or 40 years or older (CUA). Under the KP and HRI guidelines, patients received different combinations of cystoscopy, ultrasonography, and CT urography or no evaluation on the basis of risk factors. Under the AUA guidelines, all patients 35 years or older received cystoscopy and CT urography.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Urinary tract cancer detection rates, radiation-induced secondary cancers (from CT radiation exposure), procedural complications, false-positive rates per 100,000 patients, and incremental cost.

### Confirmatory microscopic urinalysis after positive dipstick microhematuria: Adherence patterns and quality improvement [^116JNmwu]. Urology (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate adherence to the 2025 AUA/SUFU microhematuria (MH) guideline, which requires confirmatory microscopic urinalysis (MUA ≥ 3 RBC/HPF) following a positive dipstick, a study was conducted. The TriNetX Research Network data from 109 U.S. health systems were queried for adults aged 18–90 years with an initial positive dipstick from July 2020 to February 2025. Patients with gross hematuria, urinary tract infections, kidney and/or ureteral calculi, cystitis, proteinuria, dysuria, and pregnancy diagnoses were excluded. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: no MUA, negative MUA, and positive MUA. The use of CT urography, MRI urography, renal ultrasound, or cystoscopy within 6 months of a positive dipstick was recorded.

Among 37,300 eligible patients, 25,904 (69%) received MUA and 11,396 (31%) did not. MUA was positive in 9,913 cases (38%) and negative in 15,991 (62%). Downstream testing followed 7.5% of dipstick-only cases, 16.1% of negative-MUA cases, and 16.3% of positive-MUA cases. A total of 855 procedures were performed without any MUA and 2,575 following a negative MUA, resulting in potentially avoidable charges. Conversely, 84% of patients with confirmed MH underwent no further evaluation.

These findings indicate that 31% of positive urine dipstick results were not followed by a confirmatory MUA, and 84% of patients with a positive MUA underwent no additional evaluation. These shortfalls highlight gaps in the implementation of guideline-based care for MH. Future work should test targeted decision-support tools and simplified referral pathways to improve adherence.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^111ZAZ8y]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin, and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^1116eVP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria.

- **Clinical scenarios**: The document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, presence of infection, viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, presence of infection, viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient; and initial imaging of gross hematuria.

Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Referral patterns for the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women in a single health care system: Room for improvement [^117QMGrk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

To identify patterns of care for women referred for asymptomatic microhematuria in a single, hospital-based health care system, a retrospective study was conducted. The study estimated the cost of unindicated evaluations for this condition. The analysis focused on referral patterns by obstetrician-gynecologists and primary care physicians. Data examined included whether asymptomatic microhematuria was documented using urine microscopy versus a urine dipstick, and whether urine microscopy correctly identified asymptomatic microhematuria with three red blood cells (RBCs).

Forty-six patients met the American Urological Association's guidelines for asymptomatic microhematuria, with a workup cost estimated at $8,298 per patient. Fifty-four were referred to a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery specialist despite clearly not meeting these guidelines. Of the 54, 33 patients were referred based on dipstick-positive results only, 11 were referred based on microscopic urinalysis demonstrating fewer than three RBCs per high-power field (HPF), and the remaining 10 patients were referred with urine microscopy demonstrating at least 3 RBC/HPF but in the context of a clearly benign cause, such as infection or menstruation. The total estimated cost of unnecessary asymptomatic microhematuria workups in patients who did not meet the American Urological Association's definition amounted to significant expenses.

### Hematuria cancer risk score in combination with Oncuria-detect for patients undergoing evaluation for hematuria [^113yGu6D]. Urology (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate the performance of the Hematuria Cancer Risk Score (HCRS) in combination with the urine-based biomarker test, Oncuria-Detect, for the detection of bladder cancer in a cohort of patients referred for hematuria evaluation, a study was undertaken.

A cohort of 365 patients undergoing microscopic and gross hematuria evaluation were prospectively recruited to provide voided urine samples and pertinent clinical information. Then, retrospectively, the primary outcome of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for HCRS and Oncuria for bladder cancer detection were reported.

Of the final cohort, 55 patients were diagnosed with bladder cancer, and 310 served as controls. In this cohort, HCRS alone achieved a sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 71.9%, with an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI: 0.832–0.948) and NPV of 0.978. Oncuria achieved a comparable performance with a sensitivity of 78.2%, specificity of 76.8%, and an AUC of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.770–0.906) with NPV of 0.949. Evaluation using the HCRS and Oncuria in combination produced a sensitivity of 87.3% and specificity of 80.6%. The combined approach had an AUC of 0.909 (95% CI: 0.855–0.962) and NPV of 0.973. For patients with microhematuria, HCRS and Oncuria together yielded a sensitivity of 82.4% and a negative predictive value of 98.7%.

The HCRS achieves strong predictive power for the detection of bladder cancer in patients undergoing hematuria workup. The addition of the Oncuria-Detect test provides an incremental improvement to this performance. Both tests can be performed at the initial primary care evaluation stage for patients presenting with hematuria.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^116YcPGC]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology in detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

### Microscopic hematuria in pregnancy: Relevance to pregnancy outcome [^116gpqSn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The significance of dipstick or microscopic hematuria in pregnancy is uncertain, with some studies suggesting an association with a greater risk for preeclampsia. We sought to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of microscopic hematuria during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective case-control study conducted in the antenatal clinic of St George Hospital, Kogarah, Australia. St George Hospital is a teaching hospital without tertiary referral antenatal care, with approximately 2,600 deliveries per year. One thousand pregnant women attending for routine antenatal care were invited to undergo routine urinalysis. They were referred to a nephrology clinic for further investigation if dipstick microscopic hematuria was detected on more than one occasion before 32 weeks' gestation. The main outcome measures were the prevalence of dipstick hematuria, prevalence of hematuria confirmed by urine microscopy, and the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension or delivery of a small-for-gestational-age baby.

- **Results**: Of the 902 women who entered the study, 178 (20%) had dipstick hematuria on at least two occasions during pregnancy. Sixty-six of 126 women (53%) who had hematuria before 32 weeks attended the nephrology clinic, where microscopic hematuria was confirmed in 40 women (61%). Renal imaging results were normal in all except one woman, and all women had a serum creatinine level of 0.90 mg/dL or less (≤ 80 micromol/L). The development of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or delivery of a small-for-gestational-age baby was similar in women with and without hematuria.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^112r2d9G]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

Between March 2016 and June 2017, the DETECT I study recruited patients from 40 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom utilizing 1-stop hematuria investigation clinics. All patients were referred to secondary care following presentation with hematuria. Macroscopic hematuria was defined as visible hematuria reported by the patient or the primary care physician. Microscopic hematuria was defined as 1 or greater red blood cells on urine dipstick on two or more occasions. The study inclusion criterion was male or female patients 18 years old or older who were willing to provide consent. All patients underwent cystoscopy and upper tract imaging within 12 weeks after study registration. Determining the diagnostic accuracy of RBUS and CTU represents a post hoc analysis.

The study protocol was approved by the Health Research Authority, North West Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee, in March 2016 (Integrated Research Application System Project ID 179245, Research Ethics Committee reference 16/NW/0150). The full study protocol has been previously described.

Medical history was obtained, and physical examination was performed in all patients. Patient demographics were collected, including age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, and smoking history. Patients with a suspicion of bladder cancer underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer or bladder biopsy under general anesthesia. The reference standard for bladder cancer was histopathological examination as classified according to the WHO TNM tumor classification. Bladder cancer was risk-stratified based on clinicopathologic features.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^117QiiXn]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We determined the utility of serial urinary cytologies in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria who were evaluated with upper and lower urinary tract studies to rule out a malignancy.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with the diagnosis of microscopic hematuria were evaluated at an inner-city tertiary care hospital. Of these 239 patients, 182 had 405 cytologies obtained as part of their evaluation for hematuria. In addition, all patients had their lower urinary tract and upper tract thoroughly evaluated.

- **Results**: Two hundred and seventy-four cytology samples were read as normal, 104 (26%) as atypia, 7 (2%) as suspicious/malignant, and 20 (5%) as unsatisfactory. Seventeen patients (9.3%) had biopsy-confirmed bladder cancer. Of these 17 patients, 2 had normal cytology, 11 had atypia, and 5 had suspicious/malignant results. No patient had a positive cytology and a negative biopsy. Overall, the number of hematuric patients harboring bladder cancer was small (7%). Cytology #1 detected 4 cases of cancer, cytology #2 detected an additional case, and cytology #3 did not detect any additional cancers.

- **Conclusion**: Because of this low prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria and the low sensitivity of detecting bladder cancers, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with hematuria may be minimal. The exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of hematuria is unknown.

### Assessing the costs of extraurinary findings of computed tomography urogram in the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^117Lk9ip]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the costs associated with incidental extraurinary findings on computed tomography urogram (CTU) in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, a retrospective review was performed. All CTUs done at our institution from 2012 to 2014 for this condition were included. Both genitourinary (GU) and incidental extraurinary findings were documented. Clinical follow-up until May 2015 was reviewed to determine any referrals, tests, imaging, or procedures ordered based on the initial CTU. Cost estimates relied on the Medicare physician reimbursement rate.

A total of 202 patients underwent CTU for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. GU malignancy was documented in 2 patients (0.99%), both presenting with renal masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Sixty patients exhibited kidney stones, with 26 having stones ≥ 5 mm. Incidental extraurinary findings were noted in 150 patients (74.3%), incurring further imaging costs of $17,242, which equates to $85.35 per patient screened. Twelve patients underwent a total of 20 procedures, costing $54,655. The total cost related to extraurinary findings amounted to $140,290 or $694.50 per initial patient screened.

The incidental extraurinary findings detected on CTU can result in expensive and invasive testing and treatment. While the costs associated with further workup were substantial, the overall outcomes in both GU and non-GU cancer diagnoses were low. Future analyses should aim to limit the cost and invasiveness of evaluation in such cases.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^1127MwzE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Our study indicates that the prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is low (7%). A key question is, what is the proportion of subjects in whom a positive cytology prompted a biopsy that was positive for cancer, in whom a biopsy would not otherwise have been performed? None of our patients had a positive cytology and a negative cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation. This is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated an extremely low yield of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria. To our knowledge, these are the first contemporary reports bringing the utility of urinary cytology in patients with microscopic hematuria into question.

As for the application of serial urinary cytologies, previous studies demonstrated marginal improvement with serial examinations, which was confirmed in our study. Because of this low prevalence and the low sensitivity, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria is minimal, especially since all high-risk patients proceeded to cystourethroscopy and upper urinary tract radiologic evaluation.

AUA guidelines recommend that patients presenting with microscopic hematuria should undergo upper tract evaluation along with cystoscopy. When the CT scan is not feasible, MRI or renal ultrasound with bilateral retrograde pyelograms can be substituted. This evaluation is adequate in assessing the kidneys, collecting system, ureters, bladder, and urethra as the cause of the hematuria.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^112PYwCc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

- **Methods**: Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

- **Results**: Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

- **Conclusions**: We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in inpatient nonsurgical adults [^112KMMGu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine the proportion of nonsurgical inpatients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) who qualified for urologic investigation according to consensus guidelines.

- **Methods**: The study population included all patients acutely admitted to the internal medicine departments of Israeli regional hospitals between 2014 and 2017.

- **Results**: Of 29,086 consecutive admissions, 10,116 (34.8%) underwent dipstick urinalysis and 8,389 (28.8%) underwent reflex microscopic urinalysis. After excluding patients with a urethral catheter or a positive urine culture, 2,206 had 3 or more RBCs per high-power field, and as many as 2,052 (7.1% of the entire cohort and 24.4% of all patients undergoing microscopic urinalysis) met the criteria for a urologic workup.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that according to the consensus guidelines, an unreasonably high proportion of hospitalized nonsurgical patients would be referred for a urologic workup of uncertain clinical utility because of an incidental AMH finding.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^11526Gkc]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

**Cytological and cystoscopic results for patients**: None of the 23 patients with atypia and negative evaluation were noted to harbor symptoms or signs of bladder cancer on subsequent follow-up. No patient with a normal cystoscopic evaluation and abnormal cytology was noted to have bladder cancer on extensive evaluation. In addition, no patient had a positive cytology and a negative biopsy. Median follow-up was 40 months, with no patient with a negative cytology and/or negative bladder biopsy diagnosed with subsequent cancer.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^111xfM7J]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection.

The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking.

Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment. Persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt nephrologic and urologic referral.

- **Upper urinary tract evaluation**: The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions.
- **Lower urinary tract evaluation**: The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses.

Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

### Committee opinion no.703: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^111iUVwE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy and has been variably defined over the years. Notably, much of the evidence is based on data from male patients. The differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is influenced by the patient's sex, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy — specifically in the bladder, ureter, and kidney — is significantly lower in women than in men.

Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and experiencing gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women under 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%.

Furthermore, in this low-risk group, the evaluation of hematuria may lead to more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost-effective. Therefore, data support changing hematuria recommendations for these individuals. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, alongside the American Urogynecologic Society, encourages future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to include sex-specific analyses and recommendations.

Meanwhile, current recommendations suggest that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years should only undergo evaluation if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Commentary: The role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^116XDB6a]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common finding in patients presenting to both primary care doctors and urologists. Sources of microscopic hematuria include infection, stones, inflammatory disorders, and cancer of the genitourinary tract, particularly urothelial cancer. A primary focus in the urologic workup of hematuria is to rule out cancer. This is done using radiographic studies and procedures such as cystoscopy and bladder biopsy.

As stated in the article titled "The utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria", cytologic analysis of voided urine, though attractive due to its noninvasive nature, has been found to lack the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration necessary to replace more invasive diagnostics in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Committee opinion no. 703 summary: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^114EWx1u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. It has been variably defined over the years, and the existing evidence is primarily based on data from male patients. However, the patient's gender influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Specifically, the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and experiencing gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer.

In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost-effective. Thus, data support changing hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and to produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, they recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Association of hematuria on microscopic urinalysis and risk of urinary tract cancer [^112rdBsK]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

We determined the incidence of urinary tract cancer in patients with hematuria, stratified risk by age, gender, and hematuria degree, and examined best policy recommendations.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a large, retrospective population-based cohort study of patients who underwent microscopic urinalysis during 2004 and 2005 in a large managed care organization. Patients were followed for 3 years for urinary tract cancer.

- **Results**: We identified 772,002 patients who underwent urinalysis during the study period. After exclusions due to previous hematuria, age less than 18 years, pregnancy, urinary tract infection, inpatient status, and prior urinary tract cancer, 309,402 patients were available for analysis, of whom 156,691 had hematuria. The overall 3-year incidence of urinary tract cancer in those with hematuria was 0.68%. Older age (greater than 40 years OR 17.0, 95% CI 11.2–25.7), greater hematuria (greater than 25 red blood cells per high power field OR 4.0, 95% CI 3.5–4.5), and male gender (OR 4.8, 95% CI 4.2–5.6) were associated with a higher risk of cancer. The American Urological Association definition of microhematuria had 50% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and 1.3% positive predictive value.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of urinary tract cancer is low even in individuals with microhematuria. Thus, best policy recommendations do not perform well. Since older age, male gender, and greater hematuria are associated with a higher risk of cancer, future studies should evaluate strategies that target these populations.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^1111cniE]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common incidental finding on routine urinalysis. Although there are no clear recommendations to perform routine urinalysis, some studies have shown that up to 50% of general practitioners continue to perform annual routine urinalysis regardless of age or risk factors. The aim of this study was to identify associated factors and the prevalence of dipstick microscopic hematuria in the general male population presenting to an annual public men's health fair.

- **Method**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data at an annual Men's Health fair from 2008 to 2013. Patient-reported health questionnaires, basic physical exams including digital rectal exams, basic bloodwork, and dipstick urinalysis data were examined.

- **Results**: A total of 979 patients were reviewed. Of these, 850 provided a urine sample and were included in the final analysis. Seventy-three (8.6%) patients had positive hematuria on urinalysis. The average age in both groups was 55 years. The presence of microscopic hematuria was correlated with the presence of diabetes and proteinuria, with odds ratios of 2.8 (1.3–5.8) and 2.9 (1.7–5.0), respectively, on multivariate analysis. There was no significant correlation identified with age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, body-mass index, smoking, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). A limitation of this study is the lack of follow-up and knowledge of subsequent investigations of patients.

- **Conclusion**: Microscopic hematuria is a prevalent condition in the male population presenting to an annual public health fair.

### Prospective comparison of microscopic and gross hematuria as predictors of bladder injury in blunt trauma [^1135W7KT]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of the genitourinary system in patients with blunt trauma remains controversial. Historically, patients with more than 50 red blood cells on urinalysis underwent additional genitourinary imaging. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that bladder injury is almost always associated with gross hematuria. We have prospectively demonstrated that bladder imaging is required for gross hematuria and unnecessary for microscopic hematuria.

- **Methods**: Patients sustaining blunt trauma with hematuria were prospectively evaluated during a 3-year period. During the first 18 months of the study (first treatment arm), patients with microscopic hematuria (more than 50 red blood cells on urinalysis) underwent bladder imaging. During the second 18 months, patients underwent bladder imaging only for gross hematuria.

- **Results**: A total of 8026 patients were evaluated. In the first arm, 214 patients underwent cystography for microscopic hematuria, and no bladder injuries were identified; 78 patients underwent cystography for gross hematuria, and 21 bladder injuries were identified. Chi-square analysis revealed no difference in the presence of microscopic hematuria to predict bladder injury. In the second arm, 308 patients presented with microscopic hematuria, none of whom underwent cystography, and 91 patients underwent cystography for gross hematuria, with 15 bladder injuries identified. The presence of gross hematuria demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity as a screening test for bladder injury. No bladder injuries were missed.

- **Conclusions**: The results indicate that bladder imaging is critical for patients with gross hematuria but may be unnecessary for those with microscopic hematuria.

### Could nonenhanced computer tomography suffice as the imaging study of choice for the screening of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^115rkqFL]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the noncontrast and contrast-enhanced phases of computed tomographic urography for detection of upper urinary tract findings in adults undergoing initial evaluation of newly diagnosed asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, this study aims to determine if less-intensive noncontrast imaging has the potential to become a suitable imaging alternative in the work-up of this common condition.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review from 2010–2015 was conducted for adults who underwent computed tomographic urography for initial evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Three nonblinded physicians independently categorized the upper urinary tract findings described in the computed tomography reports into one of three groups: normal, benign, or suspicious for malignancy. The noncontrast images of a randomized portion of the studies, categorized as normal, and all studies categorized as suspicious and benign, were submitted to two blinded radiologists who independently classified each study into one of the aforementioned categories.

- **Results**: The noncontrast images for 475 subjects were blindly reviewed. When compared to the computed tomographic urography reports, the negative predictive values of noncontrast images were 97.25% and 94.92% for radiologist 1 and radiologist 2, respectively, with an associated specificity of 88.6% and 97.95%. Of the 5 true upper tract malignancies, both blinded radiologists correctly identified 4 of the 5.

- **Conclusion**: Contrast imaging added little diagnostic value when compared with noncontrast imaging for most subjects…

### Urinalysis: Case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. For patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood; however, results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In patients with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.
