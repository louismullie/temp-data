## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what sundowning is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the phenomenon and its temporal pattern. Then, I should verify the core clinical manifestations and how they cluster. Next, I will review prevalence and epidemiology across dementia etiologies. After that, I need to examine pathophysiology, especially circadian and neurobiological mechanisms. Then, I should identify risk factors and correlates. Next, I will appraise diagnostic assessment and differential diagnosis. Finally, I will evaluate management principles, including non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timing. Sundowning refers to the emergence or worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the late afternoon or early evening in people with dementia, aligning with a circadian pattern of behavioral disturbance that intensifies as daylight wanes [^de458008] [^2c2020e2]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not merely a colloquialism; the American Psychiatric Association's dementia guideline explicitly recognizes evening agitation and behavioral disturbances as sundowning, reinforcing its clinical legitimacy in diagnostic frameworks [^958d5f4f].

> I will now examine the clinical manifestations. The most common symptoms include agitation, irritability, and anxiety, with frequent co-occurrence of confusion, wandering, and psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and these behavioral clusters often track with caregiver burden and institutionalization risk [^de458008] [^451c31d0]. Wait, let me verify the strength of association with sleep-wake disturbance; indeed, insomnia and hypersomnia independently predict sundowning in multivariable models, underscoring the tight link to circadian dysregulation [^451c31d0].

> Next, I should review prevalence and epidemiology. In a tertiary memory clinic cohort, sundowning occurred in 21.2% of patients with dementia, while in Alzheimer's disease specifically, estimates around 27.8% have been reported, and broader dementia cohorts show approximately 19% prevalence, with higher risk in older adults, those with greater dementia severity, and in Lewy body dementia contexts [^de458008] [^c6f8a253] [^451c31d0]. Hold on, I should double-check that these figures reflect clinically ascertained cases rather than screening-based estimates; yes, these studies used structured assessments or informant tools, supporting their reliability for clinical planning [^de458008] [^c6f8a253].

> Let me consider pathophysiology. Circadian dysregulation is central, with Alzheimer's disease disrupting the suprachiasmatic nucleus and producing phase delays in temperature and activity rhythms that correlate with sundowning severity, while animal models demonstrate circadian gating of aggression via subparaventricular zone to ventromedial hypothalamus circuits, providing a mechanistic substrate for time-of-day behavioral fluctuations [^2c2020e2] [^b42a2f38]. I should confirm whether amyloid dynamics contribute; interstitial amyloid-beta shows circadian fluctuations with higher levels at the end of wakefulness, which temporally aligns with evening symptom exacerbation, suggesting a mechanistic link between sleep-wake cycling and neurotoxic burden in AD [^47313d41].

> I need to check risk factors and correlates. Greater dementia severity, older age, later age at onset, nocturnal awakenings, hearing loss, anticholinergic burden, and antipsychotic use are associated with higher odds of sundowning, whereas memantine use is associated with lower odds, and APOE ε4 carriage and REM sleep behavior disorder further increase risk in Alzheimer's disease, indicating both neurodegenerative burden and sleep disorder comorbidity as key drivers [^de458008] [^c6f8a253]. But wait, what if environmental contributors amplify symptoms? Caregiver reports and clinical observations consistently implicate evening environmental transitions, fatigue, and sensory understimulation as contextual triggers, reinforcing the need to assess milieu and routines in evaluation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review diagnostic assessment. There is no universally accepted gold standard; identification relies on caregiver reports, structured questionnaires, and clinical observation of temporal clustering of behaviors in the late afternoon or evening, ideally corroborated by actigraphy or sleep logs to document rest-activity fragmentation and circadian misalignment, while excluding delirium, medication effects, and other secondary causes of evening agitation [^de458008] [^2c2020e2]. Hold on, I should verify that differentiating sundowning from delirium is essential; yes, fluctuating inattention and altered consciousness favor delirium, whereas sundowning typically reflects worsening of baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms tied to circadian timing rather than new-onset clouding of consciousness [^5488d55e].

> I will now examine management principles. First-line strategies are non-pharmacologic and focus on circadian reinforcement: consistent sleep-wake times, daytime physical and social activity, evening light minimization, and caregiver education to reduce triggers and structure routines, with evidence that multimodal nonpharmacologic interventions reduce nighttime wakefulness and improve rest-activity rhythms in dementia [^3934f6b2] [^31da37d4]. Wait, let me verify pharmacologic options; guidelines suggest reserving medications for refractory cases, with evening dosing of sedating agents to align peak effect with evening symptoms, and trazodone 50 mg at bedtime has low-certainty evidence for modest gains in total nocturnal sleep time and efficiency in moderate-to-severe AD, while melatonin has not shown consistent benefit in RCTs, and orexin antagonists show promise but require larger trials for definitive conclusions [^53b097ca] [^12357a66] [^a139d851]. I should confirm safety caveats; benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics are generally discouraged in older adults with dementia due to falls, cognitive adverse effects, and limited efficacy for behavioral symptoms, reinforcing the primacy of nonpharmacologic strategies [^fed830e3].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. Sundowning is a circadian-patterned exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia that peaks in the late afternoon or evening, characterized by agitation, irritability, anxiety, confusion, wandering, and psychotic features, driven by circadian dysregulation, neurodegenerative burden, and sleep-wake fragmentation, with prevalence around one fifth to one quarter in dementia cohorts and higher in AD and Lewy body dementia, and it responds best to structured nonpharmacologic circadian interventions with judicious, time-targeted pharmacotherapy reserved for refractory cases [^de458008] [^2c2020e2] [^3934f6b2] [^12357a66].

Sundowning is the **evening worsening** of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, typically appearing after 4 PM and peaking at night [^de458008] [^2c2020e2]. It features **agitation, confusion, anxiety, and wandering**, often with sleep disruption and caregiver distress [^de458008] [^a23e9f2f]. Prevalence is about 20–30% in dementia, rising with severity and Lewy body pathology [^de458008] [^c6f8a253]. Mechanisms include circadian dysregulation, neurochemical changes, and environmental factors; management centers on nonpharmacologic strategies (consistent routines, daytime activity, evening light reduction) [^3934f6b2] [^31da37d4], with cautious use of medications (e.g. trazodone, melatonin, or antipsychotics) if needed [^12357a66] [^53b097ca].

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Sundowning presents with a characteristic cluster of **evening-predominant symptoms**:

- **Agitation and irritability**: Restlessness, pacing, and emotional lability are common [^de458008].
- **Confusion and disorientation**: Increased confusion, disorientation, and difficulty recognizing familiar people or places [^notfound].
- **Anxiety and fear**: Heightened anxiety, fear, or paranoia, often without clear triggers [^de458008].
- **Wandering and exit-seeking**: Patients may attempt to leave the home or care facility, increasing safety risks [^7c9757a1].
- **Sleep disturbances**: Insomnia, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and reversed sleep-wake cycles are frequent [^de458008].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

Sundowning is common in dementia, with a prevalence of **approximately 20–30%** [^de458008] [^c6f8a253]. Risk increases with:

- **Disease severity**: Higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores strongly associate with sundowning [^de458008] [^c6f8a253].
- **Lewy body dementia**: Particularly high rates of sundowning and sleep disturbances [^451c31d0].
- **Environmental factors**: Low light, noise, and caregiver fatigue can exacerbate symptoms [^95ab1f4f].
- **Medications**: Anticholinergics and antipsychotics may worsen symptoms; memantine use is associated with lower risk [^de458008].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Sundowning reflects **multifactorial mechanisms**:

- **Circadian dysregulation**: Disruption of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and melatonin rhythms causes phase delays and misalignment, correlating with evening behavioral worsening [^2c2020e2] [^e8c56d39].
- **Neurochemical changes**: Alterations in serotonin, dopamine, and GABA systems contribute to agitation and mood symptoms [^b42a2f38].
- **Environmental and psychosocial factors**: Evening transitions, fatigue, and caregiver stress can trigger or amplify symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment

There are **no standardized diagnostic criteria**; diagnosis relies on clinical observation and caregiver reports of evening-predominant behavioral worsening. Assessment tools include:

- **Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)**: Assesses behavioral symptoms and their severity [^02281452].
- **Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory (CMAI)**: Evaluates agitation and related behaviors [^notfound].
- **Sleep diaries and actigraphy**: Document sleep-wake disturbances and circadian patterns [^12357a66].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multimodal approach**:

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are **first-line** and include:

- **Environmental modifications**: Consistent routines, increased daytime activity, reduced evening stimulation, and adequate lighting [^3934f6b2] [^31da37d4].
- **Caregiver education and support**: Training in behavioral strategies and stress reduction [^3934f6b2].
- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep-wake schedules, limited daytime napping, and evening relaxation routines [^fed830e3].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

Medications are reserved for refractory cases, with **cautious use** due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects:

| **Medication** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trazodone | Moderate | Improves total sleep time and efficiency | Low dose (50 mg) at bedtime [^12357a66] |
| Melatonin | Low | Mixed results; may help some patients | Doses up to 10 mg at bedtime [^12357a66] [^d9e392ea] |
| Antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine) | Low | Modest benefit for severe agitation | Evening dosing; monitor for side effects [^53b097ca] |

---

## Impact on caregivers and healthcare system

Sundowning significantly increases **caregiver burden**, leading to stress, sleep disturbance, and depression [^a23e9f2f]. It is a major driver of institutionalization and increased healthcare costs, underscoring the need for effective management and caregiver support [^a23e9f2f].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **circadian-based therapies**, including bright light therapy, melatonin analogs, and chronobiotics [^31da37d4] [^12357a66]. Digital health tools for remote monitoring and personalized interventions are under development [^d86736a4]. Further studies are needed to clarify mechanisms and test targeted therapies [^4541d176].

---

Sundowning is a common, distressing evening worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, driven by circadian, neurochemical, and environmental factors. Management hinges on **nonpharmacologic strategies**, with medications reserved for refractory cases, and it carries substantial caregiver and system-level consequences that warrant ongoing research and support.

### Sundowning in patients with dementia: identification, prevalence, and clinical correlates [^de458008]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The term sundowning is used to describe the emergence or worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in late afternoon or early evening in people with dementia.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate sundowning's prevalence and clinical manifestations among patients attending a tertiary memory clinic and to investigate its clinical and neuropsychological correlates.

Methods

Patients with dementia attending our memory clinic were enrolled in the study. Sundowning was identified through a specifically designed questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical features of sundowners and non-sundowners were compared, and a logistic regression was performed to identify the variables associated with the phenomenon. A subgroup of patients underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment.

Results

Among 184 recruited patients, 39 (21.2%) exhibited sundowning, mostly expressed as agitation (56.4%), irritability (53.8%), and anxiety (46.2%). Sundowners were significantly older, had a later dementia onset, exhibited more severe cognitive and functional impairment, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and hearing loss relative to non-sundowners. They were also more likely to use anticholinergic medications and antipsychotics, and less likely to use memantine. In a multi-adjusted model, the factors significantly associated with sundowning were the Clinical Dementia Rating score (OR 3.88; 95% CI 1.39–10.90) and the use of memantine (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05–0.74). Participants with and without sundowning obtained similar results in single domain neuropsychological tests.

Conclusion

Sundowning is commonly experienced by patients with dementia and appears as a multiply determined condition. Its presence should always be evaluated in clinical practice and a multidimensional approach should be adopted to identify its predictors.

### Is there a characteristic clinical profile for patients with dementia and sundown syndrome? [^451c31d0]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sundown syndrome (SS) is the onset or worsening of behavioral symptoms in the evening in patients with dementia.

Objective

To identify the differential clinical profile of patients with dementia who present SS.

Methods

A cross-sectional, case-control observational study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing the medical records of patients with dementia in a specialized Memory Unit. We compared the characteristics of patients with and without SS, including sociodemographic variables, etiology, and severity of the dementia, behavioral symptoms, sleep disorders (considering insomnia and hypersomnia), other diseases and treatments employed. We identified the factors related to SS and conducted a logistic regression analysis to establish a predictive nomogram.

Results

Of the 216 study patients with dementia, 41 (19%) had SS. There was a predominance of women (2.4:1), advanced age (p = 0.0001), dependence (p < 0.0001), institutionalization (p < 0.0001), caregiver burden (p < 0.0001), anxiety (p < 0.0001), delirium (p < 0.0001), hallucinations (p < 0.0001), wandering (p < 0.0001), Lewy body dementia (p = 0.05), higher Global Deterioration Scale score (GDS; p < 0.0001), and sleep disorders (p < 0.0001). The multivariate analysis revealed that age (p = 0.048), GDS score (p = 0.01), and the presence of insomnia or hypersomnia (p < 0.0001) independently defined the presence of SS. We established a predictive nomogram for developing SS in patients with dementia, with a predictive capacity of 80.1%.

Conclusion

In our study, age, a higher score on the GDS, and the presence of insomnia or hypersomnia are differential clinical characteristics of patients with SS. We defined a nomogram that helps predicting the occurrence of SS in patients with dementia.

### Time of day effects on inhibitory functioning: cognitive and neural evidence of sundowning in amnestic mild cognitive impairment [^90973a02]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is characterized by episodic memory dysfunction, but inhibitory deficits have also been commonly reported. Time of day (TOD) effects have been confirmed in 1) healthy aging on cognitive processes such as inhibitory control, and 2) on behavior in AD (termed the sundowning effect), but no such research has addressed aMCI.

Objective

The present study examined the impact of TOD on the behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of inhibition in 54 individuals with aMCI and 52 healthy controls (HCs), all of morning chronotype.

Methods

Participants were randomly assigned to complete two inhibition tasks (Go-NoGo and Flanker) during their optimal (morning) or non-optimal (evening) TOD, while electroencephalography was recorded.

Results

Both tasks elicited changes in N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components, which commonly index inhibitory functioning. Analyses showed that the Go-NoGo difference in P3 amplitude was reduced in individuals with aMCI relative to HCs. Compared to HCs, the Flanker difference in P3 amplitude was also reduced and coincided with more errors in the aMCI group. Notably, these behavioral and ERP differences were exaggerated in the non-optimal TOD relative to the optimal TOD.

Conclusion

Findings confirm the presence of inhibition deficits in aMCI and provide novel evidence of sundowning effects on inhibitory control in aMCI. Results reinforce the need to consider the influences of TOD in clinical assessments involving individuals with aMCI.

### Fasting and recovery from exercise [^5d652397]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recovery after strenuous exercise involves processes that are dependent on fluid and food intake. Current sports nutrition guidelines provide recommendations for the quantity and timing of consumption of nutrients to optimise recovery issues such as refuelling, rehydration and protein synthesis for repair and adaptation. Recovery of immune and antioxidant systems is important but less well documented. In some cases, there is little effective recovery until nutrients are supplied, while in others, the stimulus for recovery is strongest in the period immediately after exercise. Lack of appropriate nutritional support will reduce adaption to exercise and impair preparation for future bouts. Ramadan represents a special case of intermittent fasting undertaken by many athletes during periods of training as well as important competitive events. The avoidance of fluid and food intake from sunrise to sundown involves prolonged periods without intake of nutrients, inflexibility with the timing of eating and drinking over the day and around an exercise session, and changes to usual dietary choices due to the special foods involved with various rituals. These outcomes will all challenge the athlete's ability to recover optimally between exercise sessions undertaken during the fast or from day to day.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^53b097ca]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — administration timing and frequency considerations include leveraging side effects for benefit, evening dosing to address sundowning, and dosing frequency: A more sedating agent may be given at bedtime for patients with insomnia with agitation or psychosis; antipsychotics are most commonly administered in the evening so peak levels align with evening behavioral problems; most have long half-lives so once-a-day dosing is generally sufficient, with quetiapine usually given twice daily, though morning or twice-daily dosing of other agents may help some patients.

### Sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and amyloid β among cognitively healthy later-life adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f08900ae]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting one in ten adults over the age of 65 worldwide, which poses a considerable economic challenge. More than 6.5 million older Americans suffered from AD in 2022, and the estimated cost for AD is $321 billion worldwide. By 2050, the number of AD cases in the US is expected to reach 12.7 million individuals. Neurodegenerative processes associated with AD result in the accumulation of senile plaques and pathologic changes in Amyloid β (Aβ) throughout the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum. AD biomarkers may be present even decades before clinical AD symptoms appear. However, few effective disease-modifying treatments exist to delay the onset of AD symptoms. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify modifiable risk factors and develop novel interventions to decrease the risk of AD.

Alterations in sleep duration and efficiency can lead to numerous consequences for health and well-being and increase the risk of AD. Current guidelines state that healthy sleep is a sleep duration of 7 or more hours per night for adults between 18 and 60, 7–9 h for adults between 61 and 64, and 7–8 h for 65 years and older. However, later-life adults who are older than 50 typically experience less than 7 h of sleep duration and 85% sleep efficiency compared to younger adults. In particular, slow-wave sleep declines significantly with age. In addition to the changes in sleep structures, sleep disorders including insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing increase with age. Additionally, individuals with mild cognitive impairment or AD often experience disruptions in sleep and experience sundown syndrome. However, this condition often occurs years prior to impairment.

### Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease [^2c2020e2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to determine changes of circadian rhythms induced by Alzheimer's disease and to explore relationships among rhythm disturbances, sundowning, and sleep disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease. "Sundowning" is the occurrence or exacerbation of behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in the afternoon and evening.

Method

Circadian rhythms of core body temperature and motor activity were measured in 25 patients with diagnoses of probable Alzheimer's disease and in nine healthy individuals. The subjects with Alzheimer's disease were divided according to the occurrence of sundowning as determined by staff reports.

Results

The subjects with Alzheimer's disease had less diurnal motor activity, a higher percentage of nocturnal activity, lower interdaily stability of motor activity, and a later activity acrophase (time of peak) than did the healthy individuals. They also had a higher mesor (fitted mean) temperature, higher amplitude of the fitted cosine temperature curve, and later temperature acrophase than did the healthy subjects. The severity of sundowning was associated with later acrophase of temperature, less correlation of circadian temperature rhythm with a 24-hour cycle, and lower amplitude of temperature curve.

Conclusions

These data indicate that Alzheimer's disease causes disturbances of circadian rhythms and that sundowning is related to a phase delay of body temperature caused by Alzheimer's disease.

### Sleep-wake behavior, perceived fatigability, and cognitive reserve in older adults [^e8c56d39]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Sleep–wake regulation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of brain structures and functions. Sleep–wake dysregulation manifests as increased nighttime awakenings and sleep fragmentation, reduced slow‐wave deep sleep, < 6 hours of sleep, and circadian rhythm misalignment. Chronic and persistent sleep–wake dysregulation impairs the clearance of brain waste products during slow‐wave sleep (non‐REM stage 3), which activates the immune response and downstream neuroinflammation. Clinical fatigue associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of central fatigue, defined as a persistent and distressing feeling of a lack of energy, tiredness, or exhaustion not relieved by rest that affects cognition, function, behavior, and mood regulation. Perceived fatigability represents fatigue symptom severity in a given cognitive or physical task in the context of daily activities.

A large body of literature demonstrates that individuals with chronic and persistent sleep–wake disturbances have a higher prevalence of amyloid‐β (Aβ) peptide positivity, tau tangles, and proinflammatory cytokines. For example, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found that self‐reported short sleep and poor sleep quality were associated with a greater Aβ burden detected using carbon 11‐labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography. More recent studies have demonstrated bidirectional links between sleep–wake impairments and AD. Therefore, exposure to chronic sleep–wake dysregulation promotes the accumulation of AD pathology, which could start 15 to 20 years before clinical symptoms of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or dementia arise.

As the disease progresses, the formation of amyloid plaques can damage the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the timekeeper for the biological circadian clock. As a result, patients with AD may have irregular sleep–wake patterns, called irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder(ISWRD; International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition diagnosis). Estimates suggest that 25% to 50% of people living with AD have altered sleep–wake rhythms, including sundowning syndrome, which causes a remarkable burden to patients and their families. Nevertheless, early identification and treatment of sleep–wake disturbances may reduce the risk of accumulating AD pathology in the brain, thus delaying the onset of AD.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^958d5f4f]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — associated neuropsychiatric and behavioral features include apathy, avolition, and withdrawal; depressed mood (with or without neurovegetative changes) with sleep disturbances and anxiety independent of depression; and suicidal behavior in mildly impaired individuals with insight into deficits. Patients may manifest "catastrophic reactions" to minor stressors, develop delusions (spousal infidelity, persecution, theft; misidentifications; and impostor delusions), and have hallucinations across sensory modalities, with visual hallucinations most common; some exhibit evening agitation or other behavioral disturbances referred to as "sundowning".

### Effectiveness of exercise-and cognitive-based treatments on salivary cortisol levels and sundowning syndrome symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^02281452]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Sundowning syndrome (SDS) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the intensification of behavioral disorders at sunset. Despite SDS etiology being unclear, a strong relationship between high cortisol levels and SDS has been reported. Aerobic exercise (AE) and cognitive training (CT) can reduce cortisol levels. However, whether SDS would benefit from AE and CT is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether AE and CT treatments are effective in reducing SDS via downregulation of cortisol levels. The possible additive effects of combined AE+CT were also assessed. Eighty AD patients were randomly assigned to AE (n = 20), CT (n = 20), AE+CT (n = 20), and standard therapy (no treatment, NT; n = 20). Treatments were administered for 3 months, 5 days/week, 1 hour before sunset. Before and after treatments, salivary cortisol levels were sampled at 7, 11, 15, at sunset, and 20 (time of day). Blind assessment of behavioral disorders (neuropsychiatric inventory, NPI) and agitation (agitated behavior scale, ABS) were also performed. After interventions, cortisol levels were reduced in AE and AE+CT by ∼26%. In the same groups, NPI and ABS decreased by ∼50%. By contrast, cortisol and behavioral disorders were similar to baseline in CT and NT. Changes in NPI and ABS were significantly correlated with the reduction in cortisol levels. AE or AE+CT effects on SDS and cortisol levels and the lack of effect of CT alone indicate the effectiveness of an exercise-based treatment on SDS, suggesting a possible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation underpinning SDS.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^a139d851]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia, through identification and analysis of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, in March 2013 and again in March 2016, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions, as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results from the included study reports. We obtained additional information from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found six RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available). The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting. We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality. There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported. Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### APOE ɛ 4 and REM sleep behavior disorder as risk factors for sundown syndrome in Alzheimer's disease [^c6f8a253]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sundown syndrome (SS) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by aggravation of behavioral problems at sunset. Disturbance of the circadian rhythm, a possible cause of SS, also facilitates amyloidopathy and reduces sleep quality. However, the associations of SS with amyloidopathy and sleep quality remain unclear.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence of SS in patients with AD, the association between SS and APOEɛ4 carrier, representing an enhanced amyloid pathology, and the relationship between SS and sleep quality in AD.

Methods

We included 104 patients with late-onset AD and known APOE genotype. All participants underwent a structured interview via informant-based questionnaires to assess sleep quality and the presence of SS. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine odds ratios (ORs) of APOEɛ4 carrier and parameters of sleep quality for SS.

Results

The prevalence of SS in AD was 27.8% (n = 29). Patients with SS were significantly more likely to be APOEɛ4 carriers and to have rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and a higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score compared to those without SS. In the multivariate regression analysis, APOEɛ4 carrier (OR 3.158, CI 1.022–9.758), RBD (OR 2.166, CI 1.073–4.371), and higher CDR score (OR 2.453, CI 1.084–5.550) were associated with an increased risk of SS.

Conclusion

The prevalence of SS in patients with AD was 27.8%. The presence of the APOEɛ4 allele, RBD, and more severe dementia are associated with an increased risk of SS in AD.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease [^c14f9d71]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease through identification and analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 31 March 2013 using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, "rest-activity", sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with Alzheimer's disease who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors working independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias and results from the included study reports. Additional information was obtained from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available). The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting. We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs. No serious adverse effects were reported. Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in AD. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in AD, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in AD. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### A hypothalamic circuit for the circadian control of aggression [^b42a2f38]. Nature Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

'Sundowning' in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early-evening agitation and aggression. While such periodicity suggests a circadian origin, whether the circadian clock directly regulates aggressive behavior is unknown. We demonstrate that a daily rhythm in aggression propensity in male mice is gated by GABAergic subparaventricular zone (SPZ GABA) neurons, the major postsynaptic targets of the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Optogenetic mapping revealed that SPZ GABA neurons receive input from vasoactive intestinal polypeptide suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons and innervate neurons in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which is known to regulate aggression. Additionally, VMH-projecting dorsal SPZ neurons are more active during early day than early night, and acute chemogenetic inhibition of SPZ GABA transmission phase-dependently increases aggression. Finally, SPZ GABA -recipient central VMH neurons directly innervate ventrolateral VMH neurons, and activation of this intra-VMH circuit drove attack behavior. Altogether, we reveal a functional polysynaptic circuit by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock regulates aggression.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^12357a66]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non-drug interventions are recommended as the first-line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, and sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed-effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer-reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low-certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day-time to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night-time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low-certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate-to-severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD -20.41 minutes, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night-time awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI -28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate-certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild-to-moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD -15.7 minutes, 95% CI -28.1 to -3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD -12.1 minutes, 95% CI -25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD -2.42 minutes, 95% CI -5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323).

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^71487137]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In sundowning syndrome, circadian patterns of behavioral disturbances are worse in the late afternoon/evening among the elderly and patients with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders over 60 years of age. Although previous studies have revealed that aged and transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse models represent certain aspects of sundowning syndrome, such as increased locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors in the afternoon, the explanation for sundowning syndrome was inadequate because of the lack of an animal model and neurobiological mechanism studies associated with circadian rhythms. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice exhibit disturbances in their circadian patterns of mood-related behaviors with increased depression- and anxiety-like phenotypes only at dawn. These phenotypes are observed with sundowning syndrome in humans, because the period CT22-01 in nocturnal mice corresponds to the late afternoon/evening hours for humans, with the cessation of daily activity. The endogenous circadian rhythm was disturbed in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice, which is consistent with a previous study. The present study demonstrated the pathophysiological molecular links between midbrain DAergic neurons and the circadian timing system, shedding light for the first time on the causal relationship between sundowning syndrome and a hypoDAergic state in a PD animal model. These results facilitate our understanding of the etiology of sundowning syndrome from a chronobiological aspect. Although animal research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the sundowning syndrome in PD, there are several limitations with application to clinical studies. Although the timing of sundowning syndrome is at the onset of an inactive period in both humans and mice, the disruptive behaviors of sundowning syndrome are expressed in the late afternoon and evening in humans, versus at dawn in mice, which are nocturnal species. Furthermore, sundowning syndrome is a complex behavioral disorder, including agitation, delusion, and hallucination. Although we focused on depression- and anxiety-like disorders in PD mouse models, it is difficult to exactly replicate human complex psychiatric disorders in a mouse model.

### Blood biomarkers for memory: toward early detection of risk for Alzheimer disease, pharmacogenomics, and repurposed drugs [^8c11947c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological insights

A number of top biomarkers identified by us have biological roles that are related to the circadian clock (Table S3). To be able to ascertain all the genes in our dataset that were circadian and do estimates for enrichment, we compiled from the literature a database of all the known circadian genes, numbering a total of 1468 genes. Using an estimate of about 21 000 genes in the human genome, that gives about 7% of genes having some circadian pattern. Out of our 112 candidate biomarker genes, 19 had circadian evidence (16.96%), including the clock core gene PER1, suggesting a 2.4-fold enrichment for circadian genes. This provides a molecular underpinning for the epidemiological data between disrupted sleep and risk of AD, and for the clinical phenomenology of "sundowning".

### Validating a new clinical subtyping scheme for delirium with electronic motion analysis [^f9e9f1ae]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

The usefulness of motor subtypes of delirium is unclear due to inconsistency in sub-typing methods and a lack of validation with objective measures of activity. The activity of 40 patients was measured with 24 h accelerometry monitoring. Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) delirium (n = 30) were allocated into hyperactive, hypoactive and mixed motor subtypes. Delirium subtypes differed in relation to overall amount of activity, including movement in both sagittal and transverse planes. Differences were greater in the daytime and during the early evening 'sundowning' period. Frequency of postural changes was the most discriminating measure examined. Clinical subtypes of delirium defined by observed motor behaviour on the ward differ in electronically measured activity levels.

P6. (Paid carer). The most amazing thing I have found is a digital day clock. It's fantastic. It comes up with the date, the day, whether it's afternoon or morning. [For example] it would say it is 2:15 pm on Thursday afternoon. It would give the year as well. Some of them can set alarms still which is great. I know my Lewy Body [client], her alarms are all set - timed for her medication.

P8. (Paid carer). Some families have hooked up DVD players [to the resident' TV], others get a hard drive and load all the movies and music into the back of the TV… we've [also] got iPads and Samsung tablets that we use, and then the staff will sit down with the residents… either take them out in the garden or in their room and call their families… We've got a few that do [use it by themselves]. Not everybody because some just don't cope… they just don't understand who's on the end of it… I've got a lady who's Italian [who] misses her family… She understands English [but] doesn't speak it as well anymore… She has a phone call every morning and then she video calls [her daughters] every evening because she "sundowns" really quite badly. And the girls will do a video call when she's getting unsettled.

### Geriatric dermatologic surgery part II: peri-and intraoperative considerations in the geriatric dermatologic surgery patient [^5bf0a999]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric patients compose a growing proportion of the dermatologic surgical population. Dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons should be cognizant of the unique physiologic considerations that accompany this group to deliver highly effective care. The purpose of this article is to discuss the unique preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations geriatric patients present with to provide goal-concordant care. Preoperative considerations include medication optimization and anxiolysis. Intraoperative considerations such as fall risk assessment and prevention, sundowning, familial support, and pharmacologic interactions will be discussed. Lastly, effective methods for optimizing postoperative wound care, home care, and follow-up are reviewed.

### A daily temperature rhythm in the human brain predicts survival after brain injury [^f7abeae1]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

An increase in mean T Br (Fig. 3B) and a trend upwards in minimum T Br (Supplementary Fig. 4) with age suggests that overnight brain cooling becomes less efficient in older people, leading to a damped T Br rhythm. This age-dependent reduction in T Br range (and thus amplitude) is consistent with studies of T Bo and may contribute to the disrupted sleep patterns and 'sundowning' symptoms of dementia patients. An age-dependent effect on T Br both in healthy volunteers and TBI patients provides compelling evidence that age is an important factor to consider when interpreting T Br data in humans and may play a role in brain thermoregulation. Cerebral blood supply is considered so efficient that heat removal is achieved without the need for other mechanisms under most circumstances, which seems intuitive for the young, healthy brain. However, the vast literature linking neurodegeneration to cerebrovascular compromise indicates that our key brain cooling mechanism progressively deteriorates with age (Supplementary material). Neuronal activity is highly sensitive to temperature change, with a Q₁₀ of ∼2.3, although this is generally considered to be most problematic in the acute setting. In a study of 1130 epilepsy patients, 80–92% showed a 24-h cycle of seizure rates, with events most common at ∼8 am, when T Br should increase most steeply (Fig. 4D). Given that cooling can terminate epileptic discharges, diurnal changes in T Br may well contribute to diurnal variation in the incidence of seizures and cluster headache.

### Contactless longitudinal monitoring in the home characterizes aging and Alzheimer's disease-related night-time behavior and physiology [^95ab1f4f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Neurodegenerative disorders causing dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly cause sleep disturbance, which affects > 65% of patients with AD. In established AD, disruption of sleep patterns is one of the strongest predictors of admission to a nursing home. At the same time, sleep disturbances such as insomnia, sleep‐disordered breathing, sleep fragmentation, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders are associated with a 50% greater risk of developing the disease.

Disturbances of sleep in AD, the most common form of dementia, manifest in various ways. Alterations in sleep physiology include reductions in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow‐wave sleep of non‐REM and associated brain oscillations such as slow waves and sleep spindles. At the behavioral level, sleep disturbances include difficulties falling or staying asleep, frequent night‐time awakenings, excessive daytime napping, and "sundowning"(i.e. escalations in confusion and agitation during the evening). These behavioral changes are distressingand often precipitate placements in long‐term care facilities. Alterations in sleep in dementia are caused by a complex interplay of factors, including neural degeneration in brain regions regulating sleep and circadian cycles; other medical comorbidities; pain and side effects of medications;, and environmental factors such as noise, temperature, and light.

### Technology for dementia care: what would good technology look like and do, from carers' perspectives? [^8b1870bd]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Unpaid carers

There were challenges that were unique to unpaid carers, which included issues such as social isolation in the caring role, and difficulty accessing appropriate support for themselves and the PLWD. Unpaid carers also reported distress associated with the change in their relationship to the PLWD. This was often evident when the PLWD loses their independence and/or is no longer able to perform previously held roles within their family. Many of the family carers noted that they missed the "independent and capable" PLWD and had to adjust to the increasingly "dependent" person, who eventually required 24/7 supervision and care. Many carers likened their change in role to that of becoming a parent again. As such, they valued any kind of support that enabled them to find a "circuit breaker" or "snippet of time" free from the intensive nature of their caring responsibilities.

P1. (Unpaid/family carer). But living with her was difficult because dementia, as you know, for somebody on a "sundowner" is quite difficult. So, in the afternoon, evenings, she'd often get quite distressed… And then the night times… they sleep poorly… she'd be up and down, up and down.

P9. (Unpaid/family carer). I was losing more of my identity… I had gone from being an independent, active social person to just being a 'carer'… your will just goes down until your life is just this little pinprick. And you just have to dedicate yourself entirely to them, and you don't have a choice… you're just there.

P15. (Unpaid/family carer). Really, you just have that "circuit breaker" and it needs to be longer.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: a structured literature review [^a23e9f2f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This literature review demonstrates that sleep disturbances in AD patients are associated with greater cognitive decline, poorer functional ability, and reduced QoL. Furthermore, behavioral symptoms and neuropsychiatric functioning of AD patients, including depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms, and sundowning syndrome, are more frequent and severe among those with sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances and associated disruptive nocturnal behaviors in AD patients also result in considerable caregiver burden, including increased distress, depression, and sleep problems, and decreased QoL. Sleep disturbances are a major factor influencing the institutionalization of AD patients, likely through their impact on caregiver burden. Previous reviews have also identified nighttime awakenings and troublesome behaviors (e.g. wandering) as the most burdensome symptoms and key motivating factors for institutionalization.

In addition, sleep problems have been associated with increased risk for development and progression of AD. Recent meta-analyses found that patients with insomnia had a 1.51-fold higher risk (95% CI: 1.06–2.14) of developing AD, and that patients with sleep problems had a 1.55 (95% CI: 1.25–1.93) times higher risk of AD and a 1.65 (95% CI: 1.45–1.86) and 3.78 (95% CI: 2.27–6.30) times higher risk of cognitive impairment and preclinical AD, than people with no sleep problems, respectively.

### The current state of the board-certified adult congenital heart disease workforce 10 years after initial certification [^7e788908]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is growing concern about a workforce shortage in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) cardiologists to care for the ever-increasing population of ACHD patients. Providing an accurate representation of the ACHD field and its board-certified workforce is crucial.

Methods

This retrospective analysis examined a cohort of all American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) ACHD board-certified physicians since 2015. The variables of interest include year of certification, eligibility pathway, additional ABIM certifications, age group, sex, medical school type, and geographic location.

Results

The all-time cohort included 509 diplomates by ABIM, 89% of whom were certified before the sundowning of the practice pathway. The cohort is predominantly male, older, and has a background in pediatric cardiology and USMG MD training. Most are in highly populated states and major urban centers. Compared to those certified before the practice pathway ended, the more recent diplomates are younger, with fewer males and more from adult cardiology training programs.

Conclusion

There is a workforce shortage of ACHD cardiologists, and current ACHD fellowship training is insufficient to offset the attrition of the ACHD physician workforce or to support its growth to the desired size. This constitutes a call for action to survey the ACHD workforce, explore potential advancements in the ACHD training model, dissemination of a certain level of ACHD knowledge, and advocate further for the value of ACHD and its providers in the healthcare system.

### Proceedings of the sleep and epilepsy workgroup: section 2 comorbidities: sleep related comorbidities of epilepsy [^c8d0c07e]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, treatment of insomnia in these disorders improves psychiatric outcomes. Relationships between psychiatric disorders and insomnia are probably dynamic. For example, hypotheses in relationships between PTSD and insomnia propose that acute sleep deprivation during trauma exposure may be adaptive for survival, and subacute insomnia post-trauma may protect from consolidating the traumatic memory. However, chronic post-traumatic insomnia may contribute to the development of PTSD.

Sleep disturbances also accompany thought disorders. Patients with schizophrenia experience shorter sleep time and decreased slow-wave sleep. Most sleep problems, however, can be considered iatrogenic; weight gain from antipsychotics use can lead to increased sleep-disordered breathing (a problem that is underevaluated in epilepsy).

Sleep disturbances are a prominent comorbidity of the dementias. Insomnia increases the risk of Alzheimer dementia (AD) specifically, but sleep-disordered breathing is associated with a higher incidence of dementias regardless of cause. Up to 2 of 3 patients with AD have sleep problems, including sundowning and other severe behavioral problems. In Lewy body dementia, 60% to 95% of patients experience excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, or REM sleep behavioral disturbances. Although PWE also experience high rates of insomnia, since the behavioral consequences may be less dramatic, attention to disturbed sleep patterns of patients and their caregivers may yield important improvements to daytime function.

Although somewhat outside of the scope of presentations during the workshop, the participants noted that parasomnias, because of an enhanced incidence in psychiatric disease, place patients at risk for misdiagnosis of seizures.

Background

Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are well recognised in both AD (Alzheimer's Disease) dementia and MCI-AD (Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease). Such abnormalities include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation and sundowning. Enhancing understanding of sleep abnormalities may unveil targets for intervention in sleep, a promising approach given hypotheses that sleep disorders may exacerbate AD pathological progression and represent a contributory factor toward impaired cognitive performance and worse quality of life. This may also permit early diagnosis of AD pathology, widely acknowledged as a pre-requisite for future disease-modifying therapies. This study aims to bridge the divide between in-laboratory polysomnographic studies which allow for rich characterisation of sleep but in an unnatural setting, and naturalistic studies typically approximating sleep through use of non-EEG wearable devices. It is also designed to record sleep patterns over a 2 month duration sufficient to capture both infradian rhythm and compensatory responses following suboptimal sleep. Finally, it harnesses an extensively phenotyped population including with AD blood biomarkers. Its principal aims are to improve characterisation of sleep and biological rhythms in individuals with AD, particularly focusing on micro-architectural measures of sleep, compensatory responses to suboptimal sleep and the relationship between sleep parameters, biological rhythms and cognitive performance.

Methods/Design

This observational cohort study has two arms (AD-MCI / mild AD dementia and aged-matched healthy adults). Each participant undergoes a baseline visit for collection of demographic, physiological and neuropsychological information utilising validated questionnaires. The main study period involves 7 nights of home-based multi-channel EEG sleep recording nested within an 8-week study period involving continuous wrist-worn actigraphy, sleep diaries and regular brief cognitive tests. Measurement of sleep parameters will be at home thereby obtaining a real-world, naturalistic dataset. Cognitive testing will be repeated at 6 months to stratify participants by longitudinal disease progression.

Discussion

This study will generate new insights particularly in micro-architectural measures of sleep, circadian patterns and compensatory sleep responses in a population with and without AD neurodegenerative change. It aims to enhance standards of remotely based sleep research through use of a well-phenotyped population and advanced sleep measurement technology.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine daylight saving time (DST) position — "these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time". Transitions to and from DST "contribute to misalignment between the circadian biological clock and the light/dark cycle (or photoperiod)", resulting in "significant public health and safety risks", including "increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes". In the United States, DST begins "the second Sunday in March at 2:00 AM" and ends "the first Sunday in November at 2:00 AM", and internationally the "European Parliament voted to end the mandatory DST change by 2021".

### Age-related oxidative redox and metabolic changes precede intraneuronal amyloid-β accumulation and plaque deposition in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model [^47313d41]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Sex effects

The 70% prevalence of AD in females appears to have mechanistic underpinnings beyond the longer lifespan of females, but mechanisms proven by interventions remain elusive. Prominent suspects for a higher age-specific female incidence involve hormonal differences, as well as differences in ApoE/cholesterol handling and in inflammatory responses. The R47H-TREM2 mutation associated with late-onset AD activates inflammatory genes in microglia, but more genes were activated in female excitatory and inhibitory neurons with slightly less in male inhibitory neurons. To better address mechanism, studies in AD-transgenic mice found that bioenergetic deficits were exacerbated in females before extracellular Aβ deposition. In age-matched cohorts, female 3xTg-AD mice had more extensive Aβ deposits than males, associated with higher beta-secretase activity and lower neprilysin degrading enzyme. Age-related sex differences could be important at any of the age-related pathologic stages, but not necessarily all of them. Our findings reported here saw greater female than male 6E10 plaques, intracellular CA1 6E10, and mOC78, but not pAkt or GSH. This and the above cited work suggest sex effects may be more related to the later stages of Aβ processing, rather than earlier age or transgene redox changes.

Circadian time of day effects

Sundowning in AD patients involves neuropsychiatric symptoms of irritability, confusion, and aggressiveness at the end of the day. Sundown syndrome may be caused by the buildup of toxicants in the brain. In vivo hippocampal dialysis in AD-mouse brain and human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a circadian cycle of interstitial Aβ levels that correlated with wakefulness. In mice, levels were highest at the end of the dark cycle (end of wakefulness, our evening) and lowest at the end of the light cycle (end of sleep, our morning). In our studies, higher iAβ levels were detected in female 3xTg-AD brains harvested at the end of the wake cycle in the AM than at the end of sleep in the PM, suggesting that the balance between production and degradation of iAβ changes on this short time scale. Lower levels of metabolic signaling from pAkt or oxidative GSH redox state in the females could drive this increase in iAβ. This iAβ could be the source for the interstitial Aβ that builds the more stable large Aβ deposits that did not show circadian changes. Age- and genotype-related changes in GSH did not show circadian changes, possibly because the whole brain wasevaluated.

### Circadian rhythm in end-of-life delirium: a secondary analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^0e4b4696]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

The circadian pattern of restlessness in end-of-life delirium is understudied and poorly understood.

Objective

To examine the timing of breakthrough restlessness in patients with advanced cancer and end-of-life delirium admitted to an acute palliative care unit.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials that examined the effect of lorazepam (MAD trial) and neuroleptics (CHAD trial) in end-of-life delirium. In this study we examined the frequency of restlessness in 8-hour intervals (7 AM-3 PM, 3–11 PM, 11 PM-7 AM). Breakthrough restlessness was measured based on 1) rescue medications (neuroleptics or benzodiazepines) administered for breakthrough restlessness and 2) a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score ≥ +1 (collected every 2–4 hours).

Results

This study included 128 patients (58 from MAD trial, 70 from CHAD trial); the mean age (SD) was 64 (12.5), and 57 (44.5%) were women. We found that 3–11 PM was significantly associated with greater rescue medication use in univariate analysis for both trials (MAD: Estimate: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.23–0.48, P < 0.001; CHAD: Estimate: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.07–0.12, P < 0.001). This association remained significant in multivariate analysis for CHAD (Estimate: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.07–0.12, P < 0.001). About 3–11 PM was also associated with greater episodes of RASS ≥ +1 in MAD in univariate and multivariate analysis (Estimate:0.31, 95% CI: 0.21–0.42, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Delirious patients were more restless between 3 PM and 11 PM. This observation of "sundowning" may help clinicians to better anticipate this symptom, schedule monitoring and treatments, and educate patients and caregivers.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^f32d101c]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss. Motor deficits experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease are well documented, but non-motor symptoms, including mood disorders associated with circadian disturbances, are also frequent features. One common phenomenon is "sundowning syndrome", which is characterized by the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms at a specific time (dusk), causing severe quality of life challenges. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sundowning syndrome in Parkinson's disease and their molecular links with the circadian clock. We demonstrated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice, as Parkinson's disease mouse model, exhibit increased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors only at dawn (the equivalent of dusk in human). Administration of REV-ERBα antagonist, SR8278, exerted antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in a circadian time-dependent manner in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice and restored the circadian rhythm of mood-related behaviors. 6-OHDA-lesion altered DAergic-specific Rev-erbα and Nurr1 transcription, and atypical binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1, which are upstream nuclear receptors for the discrete tyrosine hydroxylase promoter region. SR8278 treatment restored the binding activities of REV-ERBα and NURR1 to the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and the induction of enrichment of the R/N motif, recognized by REV-ERBα and NURR1, as revealed by ATAC-sequencing; therefore, tyrosine hydroxylase expression was elevated in the ventral tegmental area of 6-OHDA-injected mice, especially at dawn. These results indicate that REV-ERBα is a potential therapeutic target, and its antagonist, SR8278, is a potential drug for mood disorders related to circadian disturbances, namely sundowning syndrome, in Parkinson's disease.

### The hidden link between circadian entropy and mental health disorders [^2c825d90]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview of circadian rhythm regulation and dysregulation

Circadian rhythms are generated through oscillating patterns of physiological activity and couple biological functionality to the 24 h light-dark cycle. Intrinsic sensitivity to light primarily mediates this synchronization. Light-dark cues modulate circadian rhythms by initiating internal signaling cascades, which involve several endogenously formed molecules, including proteins and neurotransmitters. Such molecules can then generate signaling cascades of their own, which may amplify the initial light-dark cue. However, due to the involvement of a wide array of signaling cascades and their respective components, there are many points along this transduction pathway where signals can be interrupted or altered, resulting in some downstream consequences of this disruption.

An explicit example of this relationship is observed in people exhibiting sundown syndrome (SS). SS was first defined as "disordered cognition, attention, sleep-wake pattern, [and] psychomotor behavior" with a tendency to be more pronounced at night. Many SS cases were found among adults subjected to post-acute and institutionalized care. SS has been attributed to mostly older populations with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson's (PD), and is linked to a clinically similar phenomenon colloquially known as "intensive care syndrome (ICS) psychosis". The clinical characterization of ICS began in the 1950s as reports of extreme behavioral changes and reduced cognitive function steadily increased among patients in intensive care units (ICU). ICS psychosis is displayed by patients who were subjected to regular routines, kept isolated from others, and often in rooms with no windows or little exposure to natural sources of light.

### Fasting: an important issue in asthma management compliance [^dc1b35fa]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Fasting, neither eating nor drinking anything between dawn (sahur time) and sundown (iftar time), may have an important role in the treatment and follow-up of asthmatic patients in countries where most of the population is Muslim.

Objective

To analyze the effects of fasting on outpatient asthmatic patients.

Methods

One hundred twenty-one fasting patients were evaluated for attendance at follow-up visits, attitudes about undergoing diagnostic investigations, and opinions and practices regarding medication use during fasting. Their sources of knowledge about asthma, fasting, and medication consumption were also evaluated.

Results

Ninety percent of fasting patients reported no harm with respect to religion of visiting physicians while fasting. Although 96% of the patients stated that inhaled medication could be used, only 13% continued to use medication in the same manner as when they were not fasting. Most patients rearranged their medication-consumption hours. Although 96% of the patients received general information about asthma from their physicians, rates of receiving information about the fasting-medication use relationship from physicians and religious sources were similar (37% and 32%, respectively).

Conclusion

Most Muslim asthmatic patients do not consider asthma to be a drawback to fasting, and they continue fasting by rearranging their medication consumption times. During Ramadan, patients should be questioned about this subject and should be followed up carefully for asthma control at regular visits.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^acfe394f]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data demonstrated that circadian patterns of mood regulation were disturbed with depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a hypoDAergic state, representing human sundowning syndrome in a 6-OHDA-lesioned PD animal model. Pharmacological intervention of midbrain REV-ERBα activity rescued the circadian patterns of emotional disorders, exerting anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in a time-dependent manner. The crosstalk of nuclear receptors REV-ERB and NURR1 is important to circadian emotional control in VTA DAergic neurons of a PD model. Our findings revealed a pathophysiological mechanism of sundowning syndrome in PD, pointing to the potential of REV-ERBα as a novel therapeutic target for affective disorders related to circadian behavioral disturbances in PD.

### Ultraviolet radiation: a hazard to children and adolescents… [^738c74da]. publications.aap.org (2011). Low credibility.

The sun emits electromagnetic radiation that ranges from short-wavelength, high-energy x-rays to long-wavelength, lower-energy radio waves. Ultraviolet radiation waves range from 200 to 400 nm. UVR waves are longer than x-rays and shorter than visible light and infrared radiation. The intensity of UVB radiation varies; it has greater intensity in summer than in winter, at midday than in morning or late afternoon, in places closer to the equator, and at higher altitudes. Sand, snow, concrete, and water can reflect up to 85% of sunlight, thus intensifying exposure. A classification system of 6 skin types ranging from light to dark takes into account a person's expected sunburn and suntan tendency.
5. Tanning Tanning is a protective response to sun exposure. 7 Immediate tanning results from oxidation of existing melanin after exposure to visible light and UVA.

Immediate pigment-darkening becomes visible within several minutes and usually fades within 1 to 2 hours. Delayed tanning occurs when new melanin is formed after UVB exposure. Delayed tanning becomes apparent 2 to 3 days after exposure, peaks at 7 to 10 days, and may persist for weeks or months. According to recent evidence, the tanning response means that DNA damage has occurred in skin.
8. In general, NMSC occurs in maximally sun-exposed areas of fair-skinned people. NMSC is uncommon in black people and people with increased natural pigmentation. The head and neck region is the most common site for BCC and SCC; 80% to 90% of cases occur in this area in the general population. NMSC is more common in people older than 50 years, and the incidence in this age group is increasing rapidly. A trend toward a greater number of BCC cases occurring on the torso in younger patients has been reported.

21, –, 23 This change in location supports the possibility that excessive outdoor tanning, use of tanning booths, or both give rise to BCC. Tanning-bed use has been shown to be a risk factor for NMSC in young women. 24 Sun exposure is the main environmental cause of NMSC. Cumulative exposure over long periods, which results in photodamage, is considered important in the pathogenesis of SCC.

### The treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders [^4541d176]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Conditions: Commonalities and Discriminators

Important commonalities are present among neurodegenerative conditions with regard to the nature of sleep dysfunction. Insomnia, in the form of delayed sleep onset, fragmentation, or early awakening difficulties, is a prevalent abnormality affecting around 50% of patients and is convergent across the spectrum of neurodegenerative disease. Circadian dysfunction is also common throughout, as evidenced by loss of robust rest–activity rhythms, abnormalities of melatonin concentration and rhythmicity, and loss of autonomic diurnal fluctuation. Likewise, where sleep architecture is analyzed via polysomnography, a characteristic pattern of abnormalities emerges; that of increased arousals/awakenings, loss of slow-wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages, increased latency to initiation of REM, and consequent gain in time spent in the lightest stages of sleep. It is also notable that, across the spectrum of neurodegenerative disease, sleep abnormalities frequently precede diagnostic clinical features: for example, sleep fragmentation precedes the onset of overt Alzheimer's disease and manifest Huntington's disease and REM behavior sleep disorder (RBD) often precedes the clinical onset of motor features of Parkinson's, multiple system atrophy, or Lewy body dementia.

Nevertheless, important discriminators are also evident. For example, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is notably prevalent in Alzheimer's disease, affecting 40% of patients, and is the predominant abnormality seen in vascular dementia. By contrast, restless leg syndrome (RLS) and RBD are more prevalent in Parkinson's disease, affecting 15 and 35 to 46% patients respectively, with rates of RBD in multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia being even higher. While daytime sleepiness and sundowning are prominent in Alzheimer's disease, true excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks typify Parkinson's disease. Periodic limb movement disorder, meanwhile, is seen more commonly in Huntington's disease.

These parallels and discrepancies likely reflect the underlying pathology of neurodegeneration. Commonalities are likely driven by shared neurodegenerative patterns of hypothalamic involvement leading to circadian dysfunction, and generalized atrophy leading to an inability to gate and support sleep stages appropriately. By contrast, discriminators likely reflect relative patterns of disease burden, for example, a brainstem emphasis in Parkinson's disease, versus basal forebrain dysfunction in Alzheimer's.

### Evaluation of SAMP8 mice as a model for sleep-wake and rhythm disturbances associated with Alzheimer's disease: impact of treatment with the dual orexin (hypocretin) receptor antagonist lemborexant [^821612c8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 45%of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) display circadian rhythm and sleep-wake disturbances, which may precede overt cognitive impairments. When these disturbances occur frequently, they can be collectively referred to as irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD; ICD-10-CM code G47.23). This circadian rhythm sleep disorder is also identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition. The typical symptoms include fragmented sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, unintended bouts of sleep during the day, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep-related aspects of ISWRD have been observed in up to 66%of patients with AD. Alterations in sleep architecture may also occur in AD, specifically reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep, and increased REM sleep latency. Increased nighttime wakefulness and activity are particularly difficult symptoms for caregivers, and sleep issues often ultimately contribute to the institutionalization of patients with AD. Treatments used for sleep disturbances in AD are often problematic (e.g. benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines have been found to increase the risk of fractures in patients with dementia), and are not recommended by the American Geriatrics Society ("Beers list") for use in older adults for this and other reasons.

Senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice, created by Kyoto University (Japan) by selective breeding, display AD-like learning and memory deficits compared with their control, senescent-accelerated mouse resistant-1 (SAMR1), counterparts. SAMP8 mice also exhibit other AD-like characteristics, including increased locomotion behavior at the onset of the rest (lights-on) period, which is potentially analogous to "sundowning" in patients with AD. These mice also show various pathological changes, such as increased amyloid-β protein precursor, increased amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, amyloid-like plaque deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, decreased dendritic spine density, and decreased choline acetyl transferase activity. Pathophysiologic and cognition/memory disturbances are the typical areas of focus in mouse models of AD. In contrast, models focused on the sleep-wake and rhythm phenotypes of AD are scarce. Indeed, few mouse AD models exhibit robust and consistent sleep and circadian deficits. We therefore wanted to investigate whether SAMP8 mice exhibit some of the disturbed sleep-wake and rhythm aspects of AD.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^8986726f]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Patients with PD experience motor symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability; however, non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disorders, psychiatric disorders, sensory disturbances, and autonomic disabilities, are also common. Approximately 45% of patients with PD experience depression and anxiety. Disturbances in sleep–wake cycles and mood disorders are associated with dysregulated circadian rhythms. One relatively common circadian rhythm disturbance among elderly individuals and patients with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, is "sundowning syndrome". This syndrome, also called nocturnal delirium, is characterized by the occurrence or exacerbation of behavioral disturbances, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, confusion, anxiety, and depression, in a temporal pattern during the late afternoon or early evening. These behaviors disrupt both patients and caregivers, and circadian disturbances represent a serious detriment to an individual's quality of life. However, the neural basis underlying sundowning syndrome behavior and its connection with circadian rhythm disturbances remain unknown.

### Role of melatonin in the management of sleep and circadian disorders in the context of psychiatric illness [^d9e392ea]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive Disorders

Abundant data shows that neurocognitive disorders such as dementia or mild cognitive impairment are commonly accompanied by abnormalities of sleep and circadian rhythms. The abnormalities might be related to decreases in the pineal gland volumes or pineal calcification. Given that the pineal gland dysfunction implies the necessity of melatonin supplement, using melatonin for part of treatments of neurodegenerative disorders is warranted and supported by several trials.

One comprehensive review on 14 original studies reported that melatonin supplements in Alzheimer's disease improved sundowning, sleep quality, and rest-activity disturbances. In this review, most clinical studies in Alzheimer's disease used relatively high dosages of melatonin up to 10 mg, mostly administrated at bedtime. In addition, melatonin supplements with a wide range of dosage from 1 to 24 mg in mild cognitive impairment enhanced rest-activity rhythms and improved sleep profiles such as sleep quality, morning alertness, and sleep onset latency in a comprehensive review including 11 studies. Melatonin can be a useful treatment for correcting sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases. When considering the aspect of compensating the abnormal melatonin secretion rather than the advancing effect of melatonin rhythm, it might be reasonable to opt for high doses of melatonin. Furthermore, high doses of melatonin have potential antioxidant effects, with speculative benefits in neurodegenerative diseases.

EMAs of Cognition

A relatively recent area of EMA research concerns the collection of many repeated assessments of cognitive performance in the real world. Moreover, emerging research suggests that intraindividual variability in cognition may be a particularly sensitive marker of future cognitive decline and fluctuations over time are hallmark features of some age-related neurodegenerative diseases (eg, sundowning, fluctuating attention in dementia with Lewy bodies). Schmitter-Edgecombe and colleagues found that older adults' intraindividual variability on a tablet-based n-back test (a measure of working memory) taken 4 times per day over 1 week was more strongly associated with self-reported functional status than an individual's average performance on the task, or that same person's lab-based global neurocognitive functioning. Aschenbrenner and colleagues found that greater intraindividual variability on mobile cognitive tests taken 28 times over 1 week was associated with preclinical AD risk. A number of toolsets have emerged in recent years to facilitate the collection of cognitive performance measures repeatedly and in the field. For instance, NeuroUX, a platform to collect EMA, mobile cognitive testing, and passive sensor data, is now available in multiple languages and is being used at institutions across the United States as well as internationally. As another example, the Mobile Toolbox arose from a collaboration between researchers at 8 institutions and offers a point-and-click system allowing for collection of mobile cognitive data on research participants.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: a structured literature review [^60810066]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal studies suggest that sleep disturbances in AD may predict worsening clinical symptoms. Yin et al. found significantly lower MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scores after five years in those reporting sleep disturbances, despite comparable scores in good versus poor sleepers at baseline. They also reported a higher cumulative incidence of psychotic symptoms and sundowning syndrome among those with sleep disturbances after five years. Escudero et al. also reported that sleep problems were predictive of cognitive and functional decline in AD patients (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]).

Caregiver burden and institutionalization of patients

Impact of insomnia/sleep disturbances on caregiver burden

Caregiver burden associated with sleep problems in AD patients was overall found to be increased (20 of 21 studies; Table 3). Only one study reporting caregiver burden outcomes included patients with a sleep disturbance defined as insomnia (30.4% with clinically diagnosed insomnia). Caregivers were typically spouses or adult children/grandchildren, and frequently aged over 50 years, with a mean reported caregiver age of 60–80 years. Ownby et al. found sleep disturbances in AD patients were associated with greater caregiver depression, but cognitive decline was not controlled for in the study. To this point, Kazui et al. reported a significant increase in sleep disturbance-associated distress among caregivers of patients with more severe AD. The type of sleep problem is also a factor; McCurry et al. reported that nighttime awakenings, but not excessive sleeping, were most disturbing to caregivers and associated with greater memory impairment and worse functional status in patients.

### Dementia caregiver burden: a research update and critical analysis [^5460a407]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Another approach researchers have taken would be to conduct multiple regression analysis using different NPS as individual predictors of caregiver burden and depressive symptoms. Controlling for burden and instrumental ADLs, a Japanese study found only delusions to be associated with elevated depressive symptoms in the caregivers. However, Dauphinot and colleagues found the presence of apathy, agitation/aggression, aberrant motor behavior, appetite changes, and irritability to be significantly and independently associated with burden in 548 French caregivers, after controlling for global cognitive performance, functional impairment, and use of antidepressants.

Such analysis of individual symptoms is not always feasible due to the co-occurrence of certain symptoms in some individuals, making it difficult to determine the unique effect of each symptom. Several researchers have elected to examine the clustering of symptoms and their effects in order to minimize statistical redundancy. On the basis of three clusters of NPI symptoms established via confirmatory factor analysis, Cheng and colleagues found that the disruptive behavior cluster (i.e. agitation/aggression, irritability, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior) was the strongest and most consistent predictor of measures of burden and depressive symptoms in AD caregivers, followed by the mood cluster (e.g. anxiety, dysphoria/depression), while the psychosis cluster was unrelated to the outcomes. But whether the effect of delusions was attenuated by the simultaneous inclusion of hallucinations within the psychosis cluster was not clear.

A team of researchers grouped the symptoms conceptually, but they did it inconsistently. In a cohort of caregivers followed for an average of 4.5 years, they initially placed disruptive behaviors into two different categories (e.g. grouping aggression together with paranoid and abandonment delusions, but placing agitation, wandering, and verbal outbursts together with sundowning in another group). Using this grouping method, they found that only mood disturbance (depression), when present, was significantly correlated with caregiver burden and depressive symptoms at baseline, after controlling for CR functional impairment and whether the caregiver was a spouse. However, when examining the longitudinal outcomes, they regrouped agitation, verbal outburst and physical aggression into a new category and found that this symptom cluster, when persisted during the first year of study, was the only one predicting subsequent depressive symptoms in the caregiver.

### Pharmacological rescue with SR8278, a circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERB α antagonist as a therapy for mood disorders in Parkinson's disease [^4eeb340c]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study clearly demonstrated that a unilateral intrastriatal 6-OHDA-injected mouse model of PD exhibits an increase in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a circadian time-dependent manner, specifically at dawn (see Fig. 5). Interestingly, the local microinjection of SR8278, a REV-ERBα antagonist, into the VTA had antidepressant and anxiolytic effects only at dawn in the 6-OHDA-lesioned mice, restoring the rhythmic mood-related behavioral patterns. 6-OHDA lesions altered the transcription levels of Rev-erbα and Nurr1 in the remaining DAergic neurons of the VTA and atypical antagonistic crosstalk between two nuclear receptors, REV-ERBα and Nurr1, in a time-dependent manner. This is concomitant with arrhythmic oscillations of TH expression in the hypoDAergic state. SR8278 restored DAergic-specific transcription levels of Rev-erbα and Nurr1, and REV-ERBα and NURR1 binding affinities to R/N sites in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice at dawn, thereby increasing TH expression in the VTA region of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice at dawn. Similarly, SR8278 also altered the chromatin accessibility of the TH genome and R/N motif enrichment patterns in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice compared to the control groups, especially at dawn. These results suggest that REV-ERBα may be a novel molecular target and its antagonism (SR8278) may be a valuable drug candidate for the treatment of PD-related circadian behavioral disturbances, namely sundowning syndrome, thereby providing insights into circadian rhythm-based therapeutic interventions.

### Psychophysiological responses in people living with dementia after an art gallery intervention: an exploratory study [^9a2938bc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The present study has some limitations. Due to the population under investigation, it is possible that some saliva collection protocols were not followed precisely, such as brushing of teeth while unsupervised. Groups One to Four were collected with a researcher and care staff supervising. However, it was not possible to confirm that all participants followed the protocol precisely. The present study collected passive drool samples despite previous studies recommending the use of oral swab collection methods. In the pilot and feasibility study of PLWD by Bourne et al. (2019), the researchers had difficulty with using oral swabs due to chewing and recommended passive drool sample collection in future studies to facilitate greater volume for analysis. Indeed, the present study excluded two participants from the saliva analysis due to insufficient volumes provided. As such, recommendations have been made to conduct diurnal cortisol sampling across three consecutive days for the most reliable results; however, the practicality with PLWD is questionable. Our sampling schedule did not include an afternoon or pre-dinner sample, meaning the potential presence of sundowning could not be evaluated. We did not ask participants about their medication regime, nor did we exclude participants based on their medications, as it is expected the majority of participants receive pharmacological treatment, which may have included glucocorticoids. We also requested study partners to complete an events diary to assess stress-related confounders. However, several study partners did not provide comprehensive information, and we could not report this data.

### Prevalence and comorbidity of nocturnal wandering in the U.S. adult general population [^f8df5851]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

As noted by Ohayon et al., nocturnal wandering (NW) is not synonymous with sleepwalking. NW may also refer to wandering during the night due to epilepsy. Alcohol intoxication can also result in drunken behavior while awake, but this type of cognitive impairment may be undistinguishable from other forms of NW. Dementia and CNS drug effects can also result in NW.

### Sleep related scratching: a distinct parasomnia? [^edfbc6a3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Pruritus (itching) during the sleep period can present as a symptom of dermatological or systemic disease, or as a parasomnia. Sleep related scratching as a primary parasomnia, exclusively confined to sleep in the absence of coexisting dermatological disorders, has not been well described. This case series describes three such patients, and discusses potentially relevant pathophysiology that can underlie itching or pain. Such cases of sleep related scratching may merit nosologic classification apart from previously defined parasomnias.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^7c9757a1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Wandering risk and prevention in dementia — families should be advised that patients with dementia may wander away from home and that wandering may be dangerous to patients, and provision of adequate supervision is important to prevent patients from wandering. However, since walking may be beneficial, both as stimulation and exercise, it should not be limited unnecessarily; providing access to a large, safe area for walking or opportunities for supervised walks is ideal, and environmental changes may also be necessary to prevent unsupervised departures, with the addition of a more complex or less accessible door latch at home potentially helpful. If wandering occurs at night when caregivers are asleep, pharmacological intervention may be indicated, and in institutional settings, electronic locks or electronic devices that trigger an alarm when the patient tries to leave may be used. Although visual or other subjective barriers have been tried, there is no evidence that these subjective barriers prevent wandering in cognitively impaired people, and if patients are prevented from leaving on their own, adequate supervision must be provided to ensure emergency egress. Pharmacotherapy is rarely effective in the treatment of wandering unless due to an associated condition such as mania, and provision should be made for locating patients should wandering occur, including referrals to the Safe Return Program of the Alzheimer's Association (1-888-572-8566) or similar programs, which should be considered for patients at risk of wandering.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^e4268bb6]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Position statement: daylight saving time — conclusions state that existing data support the elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, year-round time. Daylight saving time (DST) can cause misalignment of the human circadian biological clock and environmental clock, resulting in significant health and public safety-related consequences. A change to permanent standard time is best aligned with human circadian biology and has the potential to produce beneficial effects for public health and safety.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^7e669fe9]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

None

The last several years have seen intense debate about the issue of transitioning between standard and daylight saving time. In the United States, the annual advance to daylight saving time in spring, and fall back to standard time in autumn, is required by law (although some exceptions are allowed under the statute). An abundance of accumulated evidence indicates that the acute transition from standard time to daylight saving time incurs significant public health and safety risks, including increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes. Although chronic effects of remaining in daylight saving time year-round have not been well studied, daylight saving time is less aligned with human circadian biology-which, due to the impacts of the delayed natural light/dark cycle on human activity, could result in circadian misalignment, which has been associated in some studies with increased cardiovascular disease risk, metabolic syndrome and other health risks. It is, therefore, the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time.

Climate and sun exposure — Some parks are located at higher elevations and closer to the equator, making proper sun precautions imperative for avoiding sunburn, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and dehydration. Advise travelers to seek shade, when possible, to avoid the sun during midday hours, and to carry water, and in addition, advise travelers to wear sunglasses, protective clothing, and hats, and to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen, SPF ≥ 15. Advise mountain trekkers to apply sunscreen and wear clothing that protects against ultraviolet exposure, and recommend that travelers bring sunscreen and sunburn remedies with them because selection can be limited and expensive once abroad.

### Distressing dreams, cognitive decline, and risk of dementia: a prospective study of three population-based cohorts [^16e300d6]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

As such, the results of the present study, alongside the aforementioned studies, suggest that screening for distressing dreams in the general population may help to identify individuals in the earliest stages of a neurodegenerative dementia - several years or decades before a clinical diagnosis. Moreover, by tracking changes in distressing dream frequency over time, this may even allow doctors to determine how close these individuals are to the onset of clinical dementia. Given that the first-line pharmacological treatment for nightmares (prazosin) has been shown to prevent memory decline and reduce amyloid β generation in preclinical studies of Alzheimer's disease– this raises the possibility that treating distressing dreams might even help to slow cognitive decline and prevent cognitive impairment.

This study has several strengths, including the prospective design, long follow-up period, use of a well validated questionnaire for assessing habitual sleep disturbances, inclusion of a wide range of potential confounders, and the community-based approach involving three independent cohorts. Furthermore, the participants were not selected based on distressing dream frequency or cognitive status. The study does have limitations however. First, as with most large population-based cohort studies, there was no clinical dementia adjudication or information on subtypes of dementia. Second, the questionnaire item used to assess distressing dreams does not clearly distinguish between bad dreams (i.e. distressing dreams without awakenings) and nightmares (i.e. distressing dreams with awakenings). As such, it is not possible to determine whether the associations with later cognitive outcomes may vary by distressing dream subtype. Also, many people in the general population have negatively toned dreams which they may not consider to be bad dreams or nightmares. Given that the term 'bad dreams' was not defined for participants in this study, it is possible that they may have responded to the questionnaire item in different ways. Third, given that the questionnaire item focused on distressing dreams that cause difficulty sleeping, there remains a possibility that the associations were not due to the distressing dreams themselves – but rather the sleep disturbances caused by them. However, given that the associations were similar – or even strengthened - after adjusting for sleep onset insomnia (difficulty falling asleep) and sleep maintenance insomnia (difficulty staying asleep), this strongly suggests that the associations were due to the dreams themselves, and not the disturbances caused by them. Fourth, although the use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines and hypnotics were adjusted for in the analyses, it remains possible that another medication group - or use of these medications earlier on in life - may have biased the associations. Fifth, it is possible that including covariates with missing data might have introduced some bias. However, the results were similar and remained significant after including only participants with complete covariate data (not shown). Sixth, it is possible that some patients with MCI were still included in the study sample despite the baseline exclusions. However, the results were even stronger in the older cohort after excluding those with possible MCI based on baseline cognitive scores (Table 4). Interestingly, the association between distressing dreams and incident dementia even became statistically significant amongst older women after excluding these participants (data not shown). As such, this suggests that the inclusion of individuals with MCI – possibly leading to diminished dream recall ability- might have actually led to an underestimation of the associations, especially amongst women. Finally, given that the study included mostly white men and women, it is possible that the findings might not be generalisable to more racially diverse populations. However, this limitation was mitigated by controlling for race in the analyses.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for wandering of people with dementia in the domestic setting [^6ae81efa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting, but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting. The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia. The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 11 May 2006 using the terms exit* or wander* or elopement or ambulat* or walk*. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing intervention with no intervention or usual treatment ('standard care') or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

No suitable trials of non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention and management of wandering in the domestic setting were found.

Main Results

As no randomised controlled trials were found, no results can be reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting.

### The role of prescribed napping in sleep medicine [^21b3831c]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Napping, when its timing and duration are designed properly, has the potential to improve our daily lives. Laboratory findings indicate that scheduled napping promotes waking function after normal sleep at night, and also counteracts decreased alertness and performance under conditions of sleep deprivation. Since these effects are evident even with naps shorter than 30 min, shiftwork problems may be alleviated by the short nap at the workplace. Multiple short naps are effective in managing excessive daytime sleepiness in narcoleptic patients under medication. The therapeutic usefulness of napping in other sleep disorders, however, remains to be established. Epidemiological studies suggest a decrease in the risk of cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction by the practice of taking short naps several times a week. Sleep inertia occurs immediately after napping, but its severity can be minimized by avoiding long naps that may result in awakening from deep non-rapid eye movement sleep. Activities during the post-nap period should also be undertaken carefully. To allow the maximum advantage to be gained from napping, more efforts are needed to identify the strategies of napping that are compatible with individual cases including aging, work schedules, and sleep disorders, and to examine their efficacy in real-life settings.

### Manipulating the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms to improve clinical management of major depression [^4ebd4fd4]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nowhere is the loss of confidence in the diagnostic processes in psychiatry more acute than it is in relation to the major depressive disorders. This is reflected not only in the acrimonious debate about proposed changes to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5, but also in the degree of professional discord and the sustained social critique of the current concepts. More profoundly from a therapeutic perspective, it has contributed to the withdrawal of major pharmaceutical industry support for new drug development.

This all occurs at a time when internationally there is widespread recognition of the premature death and disability attributable to mood disorders, reflecting their early age-of-onset, high population prevalence, chronicity, comorbidity with physical illness and the degree of resultant impairment. To reduce that burden, earlier identification and enhanced long-term care of those who are at risk or are in the early phases of life threatening or chronic disorders has been prioritized.

However, this key 'pre-emptive' approach is compromised by poorly-validated and entirely descriptive diagnostic systems. Further, these systems were based on the experiences of middle or older age cohorts with recurrent or persistent disorders. By contrast, one of the few concepts that can be supported neurobiologically is that early-onset major depression (that is, develops before age 25 years) is pathophysiologically distinct from late-onset major depression (that is, develops after the age of 50 years, and typically in association with other genetic or vascular risk factors).

When the current criteria are used as the basis for identifying biomarkers of a risk or illness course in very mixed clinical populations of those experiencing major depression, they result in very poor specificity. Previous attempts to link major depression to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) axis were abandoned for this reason. In parallel, there has been a failure to link major depression to any clear set of genetic risk factors. Most importantly clinically, the outcome of current treatment trials is highly compromised. The examination of very heterogeneous groups of subjects, and particularly the inclusion of those with lower levels of severity of illness, appears to contribute substantially to the general failure to identify specific biomarkers and the large differences between active and placebo therapies. Depression treatment is also sub-optimal due to the general lack of rapid onset of action. The risk of suicide or other self-harm remains high during the period of acute depression and only decreases substantially in parallel with the provision of effective treatments.

### Novel perspective of' poor sleep' in public health: a narrative review [^c1850b82]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Who are the poor sleepers?

Poor sleep represents a new category of sleep disturbances, which does not fall within any existing definitions of sleep disorder, yet it affects a large part of the general population. Poor sleepers need to be recognised as sufferers, not only because of the impact on their quality of life but also because sleep disturbances affect long-term mental and physical health and can ultimately lead to the development of sleep disorders. We propose that a poor sleeper is someone who regularly sleeps less than 6 hours/night, for at least three times/week for 3 months (consensus between expert authors), experiencing unsatisfactory, non-restorative sleep episodes that result in two or more symptoms impacting the following day's activities. Although the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least 7 hours/night, less than 6 hours is the duration associated with increased health risk in the literature, and the one considered more appropriate for the definition of poor sleepers in order to account for individual variations. Similarly, the frequency of sleep problems occurring more than or equal to three times a week is an indicative measure based on existing evidence. Sleep regularity (eg, weekdays vs weekend) and napping are important factors to consider when assessing sleep duration, as catching up on sleep in the long term may contribute to developing irregular sleep patterns. However, short 10 min naps taken in the afternoon have been shown to produce immediate benefits without the side effect of sleep inertia. The following is a non-comprehensive list of day-to-day symptoms associated with poor sleepers: (1) irritability, (2) sleepiness, (3) tiredness, (4) increased stress, (5) decreased attention and concentration and (6) somatic problems, such as headache, fatigue, pain, bowel problems or dizziness. A summary of the characteristics of a poor sleeper is shown in figure 2A.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 6 family travel [^0f85ea26]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Traveling safely with infants and children — sun exposure advises that sun exposure, particularly sunburn before age 15 years, is strongly associated with melanoma and other forms of skin cancer, and that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is greatest near the equator, at high elevations, during midday (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and where light is reflected off water or snow; physical (also known as inorganic) UV filters (sunscreens) generally are recommended for children aged > 6 months and should be applied as directed and reapplied as needed after sweating and water exposure; babies aged < 6 months require extra protection from the sun, severe sunburn in young infants is considered a medical emergency, and babies should be kept in the shade and dressed in clothing that covers the entire body, with a minimal amount of sunscreen applied to small, exposed areas including the infant's face and hands; for older children, sun-blocking shirts made for swimming can preclude having to apply sunscreen over the entire trunk, and hats and sunglasses also reduce sun injury to skin and eyes; if both sunscreen and insect repellent are used, apply the sunscreen first and the insect repellent second (i.e., over the sunscreen), and because insect repellent can diminish the level of UV protection provided by the sunscreen by as much as one-third, children should also wear sun-protective clothing, reapply sunscreen, or decrease their time in the sun, accordingly.

It may occur every night or infrequently", and "Degree of injury, rather than vocalization or intensity of movement, determines the extent of harm". When dream enactment is noninjurious, "escalating pharmacotherapy is usually unwarranted" because more aggressive or sedating therapy "is often futile and dangerous, increasing the risk of nighttime falls and daytime sleepiness". The guideline adds that "ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the severity of dream enactment and treatment efficacy and to explore whether bed partners should be sleeping separately".

### Psychological therapies for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^e68798ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full-text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding. The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45- to 60-minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR, range 0–90) from September 2011 to mid-April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS-SR ≥ 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence). For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS-SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI -3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality-evidence). The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence.

### Confronting drowsy driving: the American Academy of Sleep Medicine perspective [^64f6c61e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Drowsy driving — individual risk factors, symptoms, and immediate actions are outlined as follows: The average adult needs 7 or more hours of sleep per night, and even sleeping for at least 7 hours per night may be insufficient if an undiagnosed sleep disorder impairs sleep quality; non-traditional work schedules (e.g., shift-work) can disrupt and shorten sleep time. Symptoms include frequent yawning or difficulty keeping eyes open, "nodding off" or trouble keeping the head up, inability to remember the last few miles, missing road signs or turns, difficulty maintaining speed, and drifting out of the lane. If drowsiness occurs while driving, you should pull off the road and rest until no longer sleepy; caffeinated beverages can temporarily increase alertness but are not a substitute for adequate sleep, and turning up the radio, opening the window, or turning up the air conditioner are not effective. Preventive measures include getting plenty of sleep before long drives and using a designated driver or alternate drivers rather than risk driving while drowsy when a long trip is planned and tiredness is anticipated.

This British Association for Psychopharmacology guideline replaces the original version published in 2010, and contains updated information and recommendations. A consensus meeting was held in London in October 2017 attended by recognised experts and advocates in the field. They were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aiming to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate, or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was circulated to all speakers for comments, which were incorporated into the final statement.

### The untold story of the scorching sun – A wake up call for sun protection [^6f5ab8f7]. Burns (2018). Low credibility.

Despite extensive warnings from health authorities regarding the dangers of direct sunlight exposure, most people still turn to sun bathing to get a golden tan. Unfortunately, that pleasant tan appearance is often lost because of over exposure to sunlight, resulting in painful red sunburns. In this paper we are reporting a case with significant sunburn injuries that required hospitalization and treatment in a burn center. Concurrently a pilot study was conducted to assess the knowledge about sun protection among the adult population and the results are discussed. The results obtained from the study revealed the lack of knowledge regarding sun protection and sun seeking behaviour among the responders. Deeper burns are rarely caused by direct sunlight exposure and are underreported in literature. Despite extensive health education and warnings, there are significant numbers of sunburn injuries reported annually. On most occasions, these are superficial and are in the form of erythema. Nonetheless, the public is unaware of the impending risks of developing deep sunburn injuries that can occur especially during protracted holiday exposures. Therefore, it is crucial to escalate public awareness and to implement preventive measures to reduce the short and long-term risks of sun exposure.

### Excessive sleep is associated with worse cognition, cognitive decline, and dementia in mild cognitive impairment [^950de046]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Emerging evidence shows that excessive sleep, both daytime napping and long nighttime sleep, is associated with worse cognition and cognitive decline across multiple cognitive domains and dementia onset in older adults. Excessive sleeping patterns are common among those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a major risk factor for dementia. Yet, research is limited whether excessive sleep leads to further cognitive decline in individuals with MCI. By improving sleeping habits in older adults already experiencing cognitive difficulties, further cognitive decline, including dementia onset, could be prevented.

Daytime napping has both been associated with positive cognitive outcomes and with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Contradictions are partly due to variations in napping measures and duration, timing, frequency, nighttime sleep, intentionality, and cognitive status. Moreover, it remains uncertain whether excessive napping compensates for poor nighttime sleep or independently relates to cognitive impairment. Subjective short or long nighttime sleep is similarly linked to worse memory, executive functioning, verbal fluency, perceptual speed, verbal short‐term memory, and global cognition. Short sleep is repeatedly linked to short‐term and long‐term negative cognitive outcomes; however, emerging evidence shows that excessive nighttime sleep is equally negatively associated. Similarly, studies show worse cognition for individuals with excessive daytime napping but not for shorter daytime naps. Therefore, sleeping excessively, irrespective of when during the 24‐h day, could potentially serve as an indicator of cognitive deficits. While sleep disturbances increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Current theories suggest a bidirectional relationship involving multiple factors. Neuronal degeneration in wake‐promoting areas, tau tangles, and beta‐amyloid accumulation, hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, may play a role. For instance, sleep disturbances, including excessive nighttime sleep, self‐reported daytime sleepiness, and napping are associated with greater beta‐amyloid accumulation. Additionally, subclinical cerebrovascular disease could serve as an alternative explanation causing both sleep disturbances and other non‐Alzheimer's dementias. Increased risk of vascular dementia is observed for individuals with daytime sleepiness, longer daytime naps, and disturbed sleep. Individuals with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk for Alzheimer's, while those with non‐amnestic MCI are prone to other dementias like vascular or Lewy bodies dementia. By linking MCI subtypes to excessive daytime or nighttime sleep, we can start to clarify whether excessive sleep is more related to memory‐related or other forms of dementia.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^4bda752a]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Together, it appears that the pervasiveness of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption is rising, and observational evidence implicates this disruption in adverse health effects. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these consequences provides the foundation from which to intervene appropriately, and disorganization of the circadian system is at the center of many of these health problems.

### Circadian rhythm disruption and mental health [^e6ad7026]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure to light at night perturbs the circadian system because light is the major entraining cue used by the body to discriminate day from night. When exposure to light is mistimed or nearly constant, biological and behavioral rhythms can become desynchronized, leading to negative consequences for health. The relationship among mood disorders, light, and circadian rhythms have long been recognized. One example is seasonal affective disorder in which mood oscillates between dysthymia during the short day lengths of winter and euthymia during the long summer days. Indeed, many mood disorders are either characterized by sleep and circadian rhythm disruption or precipitated by an irregular light–dark cycle. Sleep disruption is a diagnostic criterion for major depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety, and other mood disorders.

Shift work disorder (SWD) is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder associated with working outside of the typical 800 to 1700 h shifts. Individuals with SWD report insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and experiencing excessive sleepiness or micro-naps when it is important to be alert and productive. Affective responses associated with SWD include irritability, depression, and difficulty maintaining personal relationships. Shift work disorder can be provoked by night shifts, rotating shifts, afternoon shifts, or even early morning shifts. SWD is associated with chronic sleep deprivation and a persistent "sleep debt". Such chronic sleep loss has serious consequences for health, productivity, and safety. Pharmacological treatments for SWD have largely been ineffective, although proper timing of caffeine has been reported to improve alertness for people working simulated night shifts. Melatonin appears to improve adaptation to day-time sleep schedules and increases the length of sleep. However, separating out the effects of circadian rhythm disruption from sleep disruption on mood disorders often requires studies on nocturnal animals as most studies on humans cannot parse the two factors.

UV exposure prevention — Travelers "can take steps to avoid overexposure to UVR", and clinicians "can remind travelers that UVB radiation is maximal during midday", that exposure persists in cooler weather and on overcast days, and that UVR increases at lower latitudes and higher elevations. Sun avoidance guidance states travelers "can decrease UV exposure by avoiding exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m". and "can reduce UV exposure by seeking shade" under natural or manmade structures; because UV rays reflect off "snow, water, and sand", studies indicate combining shade with sunscreen "will protect people from excessive UVR far more effectively than reliance on a single method".

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^f4196e29]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for lightning injury, more specifically with respect to thunderstorm safety, WMS 2014 guidelines recommend to advise avoiding peaks and ridgelines in the afternoon as thunderstorms are most frequent during this time period. Advise following the common safety adage of "up by noon and down by two", and advise hikers and climbers to be off peaks and ridgelines by 2:00 pm. Advise climbers to tie off individually if caught in a thunderstorm, as lightning is able to conduct over wet climbing ropes and may affect both climber and belayer. Advise discarding metal objects, such as ski poles or mountaineering axes, to avoid contact burns.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^7c0c8639]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions show promise in offsetting the adverse effects of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption. Some of the beneficial effects of these interventions may be independent of the circadian system and sleep, however. Because our understanding of the range of healthy phase relationships between the SCN and peripheral clock systems is poorly characterized, clarifying these relationships could help personalize prescription of chronobiotics, some of which still require human safety and efficacy studies. Thereafter, comparisons of these interventions are needed to evaluate which are most effective and in what circumstances.

Ultimately, we hope that mankind's historic fascination with the temporal world will continue to draw interest to the importance of the human timing system in all facets of health.

Sun exposure in travelers — recommendations for safer exposure include avoiding direct sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.; using shade and fabrics with UV protection factor (UPF) > 30, and wearing lightweight, long-sleeved garments made of fabric with a UPF ≥ 30; wearing a hat with a circumferential brim ≥ 3 inches (approximately 75 mm) wide; wearing sunglasses that protect from both UVA and UVB; choosing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) ≥ 30 and labeled to protect from both UVA and UVB; applying sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside, using enough — typically ≥ 1 fluid ounce (equivalent to 2 US tablespoons or 1 shot glass) — and reapplying every 2–4 hours (more frequently with sweating or after water exposure); and applying a lip balm with SPF ≥ 30, looking for products labeled as SPF 30 or more. Reflective surfaces like water, snow, or sand can increase total UV radiation received.

Sleep deprivation — higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, obesity, and poorer school performance have been demonstrated in sleep-deprived adolescents, especially in those getting 6 hours or fewer of sleep per night; electronic devices and the light emitted from most electronic screens can disrupt circadian rhythms by delaying the release of melatonin, resulting in sleep disturbances, and the added effects of electronic media can exacerbate these sleep problems; adolescents should be advised to aim for 9 hours of sleep per night and to avoid using electronic devices before bed to improve sleep quality.

### British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus statement on evidence-based treatment of insomnia, parasomnias and circadian rhythm disorders [^c27664f4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in the general population and even more so in clinical practice, yet are relatively poorly understood by doctors and other health care practitioners. These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines are designed to address this problem by providing an accessible up-to-date and evidence-based outline of the major issues, especially those relating to reliable diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A consensus meeting was held in London in May 2009. Those invited to attend included BAP members, representative clinicians with a strong interest in sleep disorders and recognized experts and advocates in the field, including a representative from mainland Europe and the USA. Presenters were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aimed to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was then circulated to all participants for comment. Key subsequent publications were added by the writer and speakers at draft stage. All comments were incorporated as far as possible in the final document, which represents the views of all participants although the authors take final responsibility for the document.

Delirium — relationships with sleep and circadian disruption are outlined by defining delirium as the presence of inattention, fluctuating mental status, disorganized thinking, and an altered level of consciousness, which are also often found in severe sleep deprivation. Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are regarded as potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of delirium, although delirium itself may contribute to sleep disturbances. Studies mainly in cardiac surgical patients indicate that sleep deprivation can cause delirium or lower the threshold for transitioning to delirium, and a prospective cohort of surgical ICU patients demonstrated an association between delirium and severe rapid eye movement (REM) sleep reduction.

### What is paradoxical lucidity? The answer begins with its definition [^b65ccd10]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Paradoxical lucidity in dementia is a clinically significant but understudied phenomenon. A provisional definition was proposed by the 2018 National Institute on Aging expert workshop and published in Alzheimer's and Dementia. However, several conceptual features of this definition remain vague, creating barriers to robust clinical research. Here, we critically analyze the provisional definition and present a refined definition that can be applied in clinical research. The refined definition is based on an analytic process our research group recently undertook to operationalize paradoxical lucidity for our own study protocol. Our goal is to facilitate debate and potentially harmonize interpretations of paradoxical lucidity among research groups.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia with lewy bodies: fourth consensus report of the DLB consortium [^f8428cae]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder.

RBD is a parasomnia manifested by recurrent dream enactment behavior that includes movements mimicking dream content and associated with an absence of normal REM sleep atonia. It is particularly likely if dreams involve a chasing or attacking theme, and if the patient or bed partner has sustained injuries from limb movements.e10 RBD is now included as a core clinical feature because it occurs frequently in autopsy-confirmed cases compared with non-DLB (76% vs 4%). It often begins many years before other symptoms, may become less vigorous or even quiescent over time, and should be screened for using a scale that allows for patient or bed partner report. Conditions mimicking RBD are common in people with dementia, e.g. confusional awakenings, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and periodic limb movements, all of which must be excluded by careful supplementary questioning to avoid a false-positive diagnosis. If there is any doubt whether a sleep disturbance is due to RBD, referral to a specialist sleep clinic should be made, or polysomnography (PSG) requested.

Supportive clinical features.

These are clinical features that are commonly present, sometimes early. Although lacking diagnostic specificity, such symptoms may indicate DLB in a patient with dementia, particularly when they persist over time or if several occur in combination. New to this list is hypersomnia, usually presenting as excessive daytime sleepiness. Also new is hyposmia, which occurs earlier in DLB than in AD. Transient episodes of unresponsiveness may represent an extreme form of cognitive fluctuation, difficult to distinguish from true syncope. Severe antipsychotic sensitivity is now listed as supportive, because reduced prescribing of D2 receptor blocking antipsychotics in DLB limits its diagnostic usefulness. e11 Caution about their use remains unchanged.

Biomarkers.

Although direct biomarker evidence of LB-related pathology is not yet available for clinical diagnosis, several useful indirect methods are.

Indicative biomarkers.

If one or more of these is found, associated with one or more core clinical features, probable DLB should be diagnosed. Dementia without any core clinical features, but with one or more indicative biomarkers, may be classified as possible DLB. Probable DLB should not be diagnosed on the basis of biomarkers alone.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^fed830e3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — sleep disturbance management emphasizes nonpharmacological strategies and careful sequencing; clinicians should consider behavioral and environmental interventions, combine nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and seek to avoid use of multiple psychotropic medications; other initial steps may include establishing regular sleep and waking times, limiting daytime sleeping, avoiding fluid intake in the evening, establishing calming bedtime rituals, and providing adequate daytime physical and mental activities; pharmacological treatment should be instituted only after other measures have been unsuccessful and the potential benefits outweigh the risk of side effects; if another behavioral or neuropsychiatric condition is present and medications for that condition have sedative properties, clinical practice favors prescribing that agent at bedtime, if appropriate; if the patient has psychotic symptoms and sleep disturbance, second-generation antipsychotics may be the initial treatment of choice; if there are clear deficits in sleep hygiene, education and behavioral management might be the preferred treatment course; identification of sleep apnea is particularly important, which may affect 33%–70% of patients with dementia, and this condition is a relative contraindication to the use of benzodiazepines or other agents that suppress respiratory drive.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^7ef64ae1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Intensive care unit sleep and circadian disruption (SCD) is described as clinically important because sleep and circadian rhythms are believed to play an important role in recovery from injury and illness. Sleep quality and circadian rhythm entrainment are linked to mortality in the general population, and emerging data suggest that acute SCD may be linked to ICU mortality. Even short-term sleep loss and/or circadian disruption in non-ICU study subjects can negatively influence cognition, mood, glucose control, cardiovascular function, immune responses, and respiratory physiology. Although associations between ICU SCD and functional outcomes are challenging to prove in the complex ICU environment, the promise of broad‑ranging benefits related to promotion of normal sleep and circadian function has motivated the field forward. Research to date has focused on the associations between ICU SCD, respiratory function, and delirium, with impact on cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune functions also likely. Sleep disturbances such as insomnia are common after ICU admission and may influence rehabilitation capacity and quality of life. Opportunities may therefore exist to improve outcomes by improving sleep and circadian function throughout the trajectory of critical illness and recovery.

### Aspects of parasomnias in childhood and adolescence [^ff90294a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

The many parasomnias now officially described often occur in young patients. They are at risk of being confused with each other if their characteristic features are not well known and if they are not carefully assessed, mainly clinically. Accurate diagnosis is essential for choice of treatment, which varies considerably for different parasomnias. These points are illustrated mainly by reference to arousal disorders (including sleepwalking and sleep terrors) and the other parasomnias, such as nightmares and sleep-related epilepsies, from which they must be distinguished.

Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder — combination treatments in demented elderly adults: This topic was previously designated as a GUIDELINE, but the reviewed studies did not clearly include patients with ISWRD or measure predefined CRITICAL outcomes, and the level of evidence was VERY LOW. Two non-blinded, randomized trials of multimodal interventions that included daytime activity, bright light exposure, and sleep scheduling in community-dwelling elderly patients with dementia demonstrated significant decreases in nighttime wakefulness, with greater adherence associated with more improvement. In demented, elderly nursing home residents, two 5-day studies required participants to be out of bed from 08:00 to 20:00, scheduled low-intensity physical activity 3 times per day, and exposure to at least 30 minutes of outdoor sunlight daily, with additional procedures including a structured nighttime routine and minimization of nighttime noise and interventions.

- Avoid sunlamps, tanning beds, and try to limit your time in the sun. Ciprofloxacin tablets can make your skin sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You could get a severe sunburn, blisters or swelling of your skin. If you get any of these symptoms while you take ciprofloxacin tablets, call your healthcare provider right away. You should use a sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight.

What are the possible side effects of ciprofloxacin tablets?

Ciprofloxacin tablets may cause serious side effects, including:

### Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia [^3934f6b2]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral symptoms such as repetitive speech, wandering, and sleep disturbances are a core clinical feature of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. If untreated, these behaviors can accelerate disease progression, worsen functional decline and quality of life, cause significant caregiver distress, and result in earlier nursing home placement. Systematic screening for behavioral symptoms in dementia is an important prevention strategy that facilitates early treatment of behavioral symptoms by identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended because available pharmacologic treatments are only modestly effective, have notable risks, and do not effectively treat some of the behaviors that family members and caregivers find most distressing. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments include provision of caregiver education and support, training in problem solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific behaviors (eg, implementing nighttime routines to address sleep disturbances). Based on an actual case, we characterize common behavioral symptoms and describe a strategy for selecting evidence-based nonpharmacologic dementia treatments. Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia can significantly improve quality of life and patient-caregiver satisfaction.

### Understanding and approaching excessive daytime sleepiness [^dbcfa3af]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a public health issue. However, it remains largely undervalued, scarcely diagnosed, and poorly supported. Variations in the definition of EDS and limitations in clinical assessment lead to difficulties in its epidemiological study, but the relevance of this symptom from a socioeconomic perspective is inarguable. EDS might be a consequence of several behavioural issues leading to insufficient or disrupted sleep, as well as a consequence of sleep disorders including sleep apnoea syndrome, circadian disorders, central hypersomnolence disorders (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), other medical or psychiatric conditions, or medications. Furthermore, EDS can have implications for health as it is thought to act as a risk factor for other conditions, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Because of the heterogeneous causes of EDS and the complexity of its pathophysiology, management will largely depend on the cause, with the final aim of making treatment specific to the individual using precision medicine and personalised medicine.
