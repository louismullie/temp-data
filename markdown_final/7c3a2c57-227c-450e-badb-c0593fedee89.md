## Question

what is pansinustitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pansinusitis is and wants a definition of the term. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the linguistic construction and conventional clinical usage of the term. Then, I should verify how imaging characterizes anatomic extent. Next, I will review temporal course (acute vs chronic) and laterality (unilateral vs bilateral). After that, I need to check associated conditions and complications that often co-occur. Finally, I should differentiate pansinusitis from guideline-based diagnostic frameworks for rhinosinusitis and synthesize a refined definition, while self-checking any overstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the term itself: "pan-" means "all", and "sinusitis" denotes inflammation of the paranasal sinuses; so, by construction, pansinusitis implies inflammation involving all paranasal sinuses rather than a localized subset, and I should verify that the literature uses it this way in practice, not as a separate diagnostic entity with its own criteria.

> I will now examine clinical usage patterns to ensure this interpretation aligns with real-world reports; wait, let me verify specific contexts where the term is used. Kartagener syndrome (a primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotype) is classically described with chronic pansinusitis, situating the term in diffuse inflammatory sinonasal disease states, and acute or chronic cases appear across reports including cystic fibrosis and other severe presentations, which reinforces pansinusitis as an extensive, rather than focal, sinonasal process [^112CXuHQ] [^112guEkj] [^117Bc32s].

> Next, I should review imaging characterizations; hold on, I should verify whether CT descriptions consistently show multi-sinus involvement. Imaging case series explicitly describe "pansinusitis with complete opacification of the paranasal sinuses", and radiologic narratives consistently emphasize multi-cavity involvement; CT remains the optimal modality for delineating the full anatomic extent of disease in CRS contexts, though its use should be clinically indicated and interpreted with symptoms due to false positives [^114VESDS].

> Let me consider temporal and laterality facets; I should confirm that usage spans acute and chronic, unilateral and bilateral. The documents include "chronic pansinusitis" (e.g., in Kartagener syndrome) and "acute unilateral pansinusitis" complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis; bilateral disease is often observed and may suggest benignity in contrast to unilateral opacification that can raise concern for neoplasm, though that heuristic must be contextualized with clinical and endoscopic findings [^112CXuHQ] [^115RpCH2].

> I need to check associations and complications to understand clinical significance. Reported associations include primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener syndrome) and cystic fibrosis; severe complications such as subdural empyema, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and mucopyoceles underscore that pansinusitis often represents extensive disease with higher complication risk, warranting vigilance for orbital or intracranial spread and urgent multidisciplinary management when suspected [^112CXuHQ] [^112guEkj] [^1113XGci] [^115RpCH2] [^117NdB5h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic frameworks; I should confirm how pansinusitis relates to guideline-defined rhinosinusitis categories. Standard definitions of CRS and ABRS hinge on symptom duration and objective evidence of inflammation rather than the anatomic extent "pan", and guideline methodology requires objective documentation (endoscopy or CT) for CRS confirmation; thus, pansinusitis functions as an anatomic descriptor layered onto these entities rather than a standalone diagnosis with distinct criteria [^116Jkr2C] [^1164DQ9t] [^1128B1i8] [^115FTUXp].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I implied that "complete opacification" on CT defines pansinusitis; I should double-check whether that is too stringent. While some imaging exemplars show complete opacification, the core concept is diffuse involvement of all paranasal sinuses (maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal), which may manifest as mucosal thickening or partial opacification across all sinuses; requiring complete opacification would be overly restrictive and not mandated by guidelines, which emphasize objective evidence of inflammation and clinical context for imaging use in CRS and for complications in ARS [^1163DUsL] [^112399jW] [^116Jkr2C] [^116ood7u].

> Let me synthesize a refined, clinically useful definition, ensuring clarity on scope, time course, and laterality. Pansinusitis is best defined as sinonasal inflammation involving all paranasal sinuses (maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal) within a side or bilaterally, demonstrable by objective findings (endoscopic evidence across drainage pathways and/or CT evidence of mucosal disease in each sinus), and it can present as acute or chronic and unilateral or bilateral; it often occurs in systemic mucociliary disorders (e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis) and is associated with higher risk of complications such as mucopyoceles, orbital involvement, and intracranial extension, necessitating prompt recognition and appropriate imaging when complications are suspected [^112CXuHQ] [^112guEkj] [^117NdB5h] [^1113XGci] [^115RpCH2] [^116Jkr2C] [^114VESDS].

> But wait, what if we over-interpret laterality as implying malignancy? I should verify the nuance here: unilateral opacification can raise concern for neoplasm, yet unilateral pansinusitis is documented in acute infectious contexts as well; therefore, laterality must be integrated with clinical features, endoscopic findings, and bone changes on imaging (e.g., bony destruction vs rarefaction) before concluding malignant versus benign processes [^115RpCH2] [^1163DUsL].

> Finally, I need to ensure the operational implications are consistent with guidelines. For patients labeled with pansinusitis, clinicians should still apply standard ABRS/CRS diagnostic criteria and reserve CT for CRS confirmation, surgical planning, or when complications are suspected, while evaluating for underlying disorders like cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia in diffuse or recurrent disease patterns per guideline emphasis on comorbid modifiers; this maintains diagnostic rigor while using "pansinusitis" to communicate anatomical extent and potential risk [^116Jkr2C] [^114VESDS] [^116FFPkX] [^116KRGjn] [^116ood7u].

Pansinusitis is inflammation of **all paranasal sinuses** (maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid) and can be acute or chronic [^1163DUsL]. Diagnosis requires **objective confirmation** [^116Jkr2C] by nasal endoscopy or CT [^1164DQ9t], not symptoms alone. Management includes antibiotics for acute bacterial cases [^11552ayP], intranasal corticosteroids [^115Ks3ay], saline irrigation, and surgery [^116FFPkX] for refractory disease or complications. Complications can be severe, including orbital [^117NdB5h] and intracranial spread [^115RpCH2], so prompt recognition and treatment are essential.

---

## Clinical presentation

Pansinusitis presents with **symptoms reflecting inflammation of all paranasal sinuses** [^114xDzAh]:

- **Nasal congestion**: blockage or obstruction
- **Nasal discharge**: anterior or posterior drainage
- **Facial pain**: pressure or fullness
- **Hyposmia**: reduced sense of smell
- **Headache**: diffuse or localized
- **Fever**: systemic symptoms in acute cases

These symptoms must **persist for at least 12 weeks** [^1128B1i8] to meet the criteria for chronic pansinusitis [^116Jkr2C].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of pansinusitis **requires both clinical symptoms and objective evidence** of sinonasal inflammation [^116Jkr2C]. Criteria include at least two symptoms persisting for ≥ 12 weeks — nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, or hyposmia [^1128B1i8] — plus **objective confirmation** by nasal endoscopy or computed tomography (CT) [^1164DQ9t] showing inflammation in all paranasal sinuses [^114VESDS]. CT imaging is the **gold standard** for confirming pansinusitis, providing detailed visualization of sinus involvement and guiding surgical planning when necessary [^112399jW].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Pansinusitis has **infectious and non-infectious etiologies**. Infectious causes include bacterial (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) [^11552ayP], viral (e.g. influenza, rhinovirus), and fungal (e.g. Aspergillus species) infections [^116raUVV]. Non-infectious causes include allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders, anatomical abnormalities, and environmental irritants. Risk factors include **chronic respiratory conditions** (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis), **immunodeficiency** [^116KRGjn], and **exposure to allergens or pollutants** [^116hidHG].

---

## Complications

If left untreated, pansinusitis can lead to **severe complications**:

- **Orbital complications**: orbital cellulitis, abscess formation, proptosis, and vision loss [^117NdB5h].
- **Intracranial complications**: meningitis, brain abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis [^115RpCH2], and subdural empyema [^1113XGci].
- **Systemic complications**: sepsis and chronic respiratory infections.

---

## Treatment strategies

Management combines **medical and surgical** approaches. Medical therapy includes **antibiotics** for acute bacterial infections [^11552ayP], intranasal corticosteroids [^115Ks3ay], saline irrigation, and antihistamines for allergic components, while **surgical options** — functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) [^116FFPkX] or balloon sinuplasty [^115cTHif] — are reserved for chronic or refractory cases or when complications arise.

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, disease severity, and adherence to treatment. Chronic pansinusitis has a **high recurrence rate** [^1164dpQt], necessitating long-term medical management and regular follow-up.

---

Pansinusitis is a severe inflammation of all paranasal sinuses, requiring objective confirmation [^116Jkr2C] and a combination of medical and surgical treatments [^116FFPkX]. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent **complications and recurrence** [^1164dpQt].

**Methods**: We created a checklist that includes the most prevalent co‐occurring features reported in post-COVID condition (PCC), which have emerged from a systematic review as well as from clinical experience. This checklist is designed to assess whether each symptom is present and whether its timeframe of onset and persistence fulfills WHO criteria to assess for plausible association with primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Based on checklist assessment, we also provided a criterion to define possible PCC cases. Other possibly relevant symptoms, whose association with PCC is less clear or established, were reported in a checklist (supplementary appendix — Data S1) for further phenotyping only, not for PCC case definition. Finally, considering target population characteristics, the most frequently reported symptoms, and reported alterations in cognitive/psychiatric domains, we devised a comprehensive protocol for cognitive, psychiatric, and general symptom evaluation.

### Dupilumab in CRSwNP: responder analysis using clinically meaningful efficacy outcome thresholds [^115J3pCZ]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

Data reported from the SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 phase 3 trials demonstrate a substantial reduction in the proportion of dupilumab‐treated patients with anosmia, determined by the clinician‐observed measure of smell, UPSIT. At week 24 in SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52, there were decreases of 50% and 49%, respectively, in the proportion of dupilumab‐treated patients with anosmia, compared with negligible changes in placebo‐treated patients. Our findings on UPSIT further show that more than half of the dupilumab‐treated patients, compared with approximately 6% of placebo‐treated patients, reached the clinically meaningful responder threshold of smell improvement.

Several biologic treatments are either approved or being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with CRSwNP. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis (EPOS) and European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) consensus guidelines on biologics for CRSwNP have outlined criteria that are important when considering biologic therapy. The EPOS concluded that biologics should be indicated in patients with three of the following criteria: evidence of type 2 inflammation (tissue eosinophils ≥ 10/high power field, hpf [×400], or blood eosinophils ≥ 250/μL, or total IgE ≥ 100 IU/mL); need for SCS in the previous two years; significant impairment in HRQoL; significant LoS; or diagnosis of comorbid asthma. The EUFOREA criteria for the indication of biologics included a confirmed diagnosis of uncontrolled severe CRSwNP, a high likelihood of type 2 inflammation (blood eosinophils ≥ 300/μL).

### Covid-19-related headache and sinonasal inflammation: A longitudinal study analysing the role of acute rhinosinusitis and ICHD-3 classification difficulties in SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111mauUd]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The genesis of headache in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently unclear, and the multitude of disease symptoms often further hinders locating the source of pain. Interestingly, many subjects with COVID-19 have symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis. The relation between nasal symptoms and headache in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown.

- **Methods**: This bi-center longitudinal study evaluated symptoms in consecutive COVID-19 patients in the participating practices. The first assessment was performed during the initial consultation after infection confirmation, followed by a second consultation following a median of 9 days.

- **Results**: 130 patients were included in the study (80 women, 50 men; mean age 46.9 years). Headache was highly prevalent at the first visit (72%) and significantly associated with acute rhinosinusitis symptoms. The odds ratio for headache in subjects with rhinosinusitis was 3.5. Headache could be attributed to systemic viral infection in 96% and to acute rhinosinusitis in 51% of cases according to the 3rd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Criterion C.3 (exacerbation of headache by pressure applied over paranasal sinuses) and C.4 (ipsilateral nature of headache and sinusitis) had low sensitivity in headache attributed to acute rhinosinusitis.

- **Conclusions**: Nasal inflammation is associated with headache in COVID-19, although the pain mechanism likely lies in a systemic reaction to the virus. The 3rd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for headaches attributed to acute rhinosinusitis requires further evaluation.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116hidHG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, historically, has been considered to be caused by upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, today that concept has changed, as it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder. It exhibits increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to asthma. Exacerbations are caused by aeroallergens in allergic individuals and irritants, pollutants, and viral or bacterial infections in all subjects.

- **Phenotypes and endotypes**: Chronic rhinosinusitis may be categorized by phenotypes, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. Defined endotypes are based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes will optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies.

Understanding that rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of various predisposing conditions and new medical treatment options. This reinforces the concept that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical problem.

### Endotyping in chronic rhinosinusitis-an EAACI task force report [^113ABMBz]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the nose and paranasal sinuses, diagnosed through a combination of symptoms such as nasal blockage and/or nasal discharge, along with facial pain/pressure and/or reduction or loss of smell. It also requires compatible endoscopic findings such as nasal polyps, edema, and purulent discharge, with optional radiological findings. Although CRS can occur in the context of systemic conditions like cystic fibrosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or present unilaterally, as in the case of a fungal ball, it is commonly a primary diffuse (bilateral) disease. This condition is also a heterogeneous entity regarding symptoms, mechanisms, prognosis, and therapy response, where distinct phenotypes and endotypes can be identified.

From a historical perspective, international guidelines used to propose a phenotypic classification of the disease based on the presence (CRSwNP) or absence (CRSsNP) of nasal polyps. Recent updates of the CRS classification advocate for an endotypic classification, focusing on underlying activated immune/inflammatory pathways. This task force report summarizes current knowledge of CRS endotypes and discusses the possibilities and limitations of endotyping CRS in clinical practice.

- **Type 1, 2, and 3 immunological response pathways**: Single or combined responses are aimed at eliminating the identified class of pathogens such as viruses, parasites, or bacteria/fungi, respectively. Type 1 (T1) canonical cytokines include IFN‐gamma (IFN‐γ) and IL‐12. Type 2 (T2) cytokines encompass IL‐4, IL‐5, and IL‐13. Type 3 (T3) cytokines consist of IL‐17A and IL‐22.

### Comparing early signs and basic symptoms as methods for predicting psychotic relapse in clinical practice [^1125DsLN]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

To monitor basic symptoms as part of a personalized relapse signature, clinicians need to identify which of these an individual experienced prior to previous relapses. The best way of identifying pre-relapse basic symptoms in the study was a verbal checklist asking specifically about these experiences; twice as many participants identified basic symptoms during verbal checklists than during in-depth interviews. This may be because the in-depth interview required recall memory, whereas the verbal checklist only used recognition memory, the latter being easier and both being impaired in schizophrenia.

Unlike psychotic symptoms, patients are not commonly asked about basic symptoms in a UK mental health service context. Aside from a small number of early intervention services assessing basic symptoms as prodromal symptoms of FEP (e.g. Lancashire Early Assessment and Detection Clinic), very few clinical services in the UK assess them. Participants in the study, all receiving care from UK mental health services, may not have spontaneously divulged these experiences because they did not expect the interviewer to be interested in them.

Moreover, patients may not recognize the experiences as 'symptoms' per se and only begin to think their experience is unusual when asked about them. Some basic symptoms may not be spontaneously divulged due to embarrassment, whereas being asked as part of a checklist, framed as a list of experiences that people sometimes report before relapse, may normalize the experience.

### Rhinosinusitis: Developing guidance for clinical trials [^113Z99rb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The Rhinosinusitis Initiative was developed by five national societies. The guidance document, an expansion of the 2004 publication "Rhinosinusitis: Establishing definitions for clinical research and patient care", provides templates for clinical trials in antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and symptom-relieving therapies for the following conditions: (1) acute presumed bacterial rhinosinusitis, (2) chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, (3) CRS with nasal polyps, and (4) classic allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. In addition to the templates for clinical trials and proposed study designs, the Rhinosinusitis Initiative has developed six appendices addressing:

- **Health outcomes**: Assessing the impact of treatments on patient health.
- **Nasal endoscopy and staging of CRS**: Providing criteria for diagnosis and progression.
- **Radiologic imaging**: Guidelines for utilizing imaging in diagnosis.
- **Microbiology**: Standard practices for microbial analysis.
- **Laboratory measures**: Recommended laboratory tests and their relevance.
- **Biostatistical methods**: Suggested statistical techniques for data analysis.

### Dupixent [^113gDwRC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The demographics and baseline characteristics of these two trials are provided in Table 25 below.

- **Clinical response (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52)**: The results for primary endpoints in CRSwNP studies are presented in Table 26. Statistically significant efficacy was observed in SINUS-52 regarding improvement in the bilateral endoscopic NPS score at week 24 and week 52.

Figure 11: LS mean change from baseline in bilateral nasal polyps score (NPS) up to week 52 in subjects 18 years of age and older with CRSwNP (SINUS-52 - ITT Population).

Similar results were seen in SINUS-24 at week 24. In the post-treatment period, when subjects were off DUPIXENT, the treatment effect diminished over time.

Figure 12: LS mean change from baseline in bilateral nasal polyps score (NPS) up to week 48 in subjects 18 years of age and older with CRSwNP (SINUS-24 - ITT Population).

At week 52, the LS mean difference for nasal congestion in the DUPIXENT group versus placebo was -0.98 (95% CI: -1.17, -0.79). In both studies, significant improvements in nasal congestion were observed as early as the first assessment at week 4. The LS mean difference for nasal congestion at week 4 in the DUPIXENT group versus placebo was -0.41 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.30) in SINUS-24 and -0.37 (95% CI: -0.46, -0.27) in SINUS-52.

### The sinonasal outcome test-22 or European position paper: Which is more indicative of imaging results [^115moNjG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Approval for this study was obtained from the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board before data collection began.

- **Study design and participants**: Consecutive patients age 18 years or older who presented with a chief complaint of rhinosinusitis or nasal drainage to a participating hospital ambulatory otolaryngology clinic were eligible. Patients were included if they prospectively provided a structured sinonasal history, completed the entire SNOT-22 questionnaire, and underwent sinus CT imaging within 1 month. The structured history included an assessment of symptom duration. Exclusion criteria were the presence of nonnasal chief complaints or lack of either SNOT-22 completion or related imaging within the specified timeframe. Since studies of discriminatory ability ideally include patients with a range of symptom and disease states, symptom thresholds and endoscopy were not a requirement for entry.

### Judicious antibiotic use and intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis [^112R3HEL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis are treated with antibiotics. However, many cases of rhinosinusitis are secondary to viral infections and are unlikely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. The inappropriate use of antibiotics in patients with acute nonbacterial rhinosinusitis contributes to the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance. Consequently, safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics are needed in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral infections. Recent results from controlled trials have shown that intranasal corticosteroids, used in combination with antibiotics or as monotherapy in selected cases, provide significant symptom relief and resolution of acute rhinosinusitis. The use of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis, therefore, might reduce the inappropriate use of antimicrobial therapy in such cases.

### Real-life assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis patients using mobile technology: The mySinusitisCoach project by EUFOREA [^116sV4Bx]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

**Assessment of disease control**: The level of disease control assessed by the patient in the mSC app was based on the VAS global sinusitis symptom score, which correlates with SinoNasal Outcome Test‐22 (SNOT‐22) scores. The following cut‐off levels were applied: controlled (VAS ≤ 20 mm), partly controlled (VAS > 20 mm and ≤ 50 mm), and uncontrolled (VAS > 50 mm and ≤ 100 mm). Alternatively, disease control was defined based on the adapted EPOS criteria for comparison in Figure 1 only. Five characteristics (nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea/postnasal drip, facial pain, impaired sense of smell, and sleep disturbance or fatigue) are deemed critical to determine the level of disease control according to EPOS guidelines: controlled (no symptoms present), partly controlled (presence of at least one symptom), or uncontrolled (presence of 3 or more symptoms). Clinical signs of inflammation and medication history were not taken into account. For the study, a VAS level higher than 50 mm was used to define the presence of one of the respective symptoms.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number, and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article reviews the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and also summarizes the guidelines.

### Contemporary classification of chronic rhinosinusitis beyond polyps vs no polyps: A review [^116E1Srt]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a broadly defined process used to describe a variety of sinonasal pathologic conditions, ranging from odontogenic sinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis to the more contemporary definition of broad inflammatory airway conditions. Historically, classification systems have categorized these conditions into CRS with nasal polyps and CRS without nasal polyps. However, there is growing recognition of distinct inflammatory subtypes within CRS, which could enhance treatment delivery and effectiveness.

In clinical practice, treatment decisions hinge on observable findings, clinical history, presumed disease, and molecular pathophysiologic characteristics. A proposed classification system, both simple and practical, suggests that the initial division of CRS should be based on functional anatomical compartments, leading to classifications as either local or diffuse CRS. These are typically unilateral or bilateral, with "diffuse" indicating the disease's presence beyond a recognizable functional anatomical unit rather than implying "pansinusitis". This system considers local anatomical factors in pathogenesis and separates inflammatory endotype dominance into type 2 skewed inflammation, bearing implications for cause and treatment strategies. The non-type 2 CRS includes other unknown inflammatory aspects that may evolve over time. The proposed phenotypes or clinical examples illustrate CRS entities in line with this classification system.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, equating to about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### Bronchiolitis as a feature of Kartagener syndrome: A case report [^112CXuHQ]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Kartagener syndrome (KS), also known as immotile cilia syndrome or primary ciliary dyskinesia, is characterized by the triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic pansinusitis. A few studies have reported that diffuse bronchiolitis might be one of the characteristic features of the lung in KS. We aimed to present the radiologic characteristics of KS, including diffuse bronchiolitis, sinus aplasia, and situs inversus totalis in a single case.

### Pneumosinus dilatans: A novel algorithm for its classification and management [^113rHo7D]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Pneumosinus dilatans (PD) is a rare condition in which one or more paranasal sinuses are pathologically hyperaerated. Patients commonly present with an aesthetic complaint; however, it has been associated with several serious conditions. The etiology is largely theoretical, and the management remains unstandardized, potentially leading to missed diagnoses. This article aims to establish a presumptive classification scheme and management algorithm based on a comprehensive review of the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of all available publications on the search term "Pneumosinus dilatans" was conducted in PubMed. Associated conditions were identified and clustered based on the number and anatomic location of the sinuses involved. The resultant data was used to formulate an evidence-based algorithm for the evaluation and management of PD patients.

- **Results**: A total of 145 patients from 103 articles were included. The majority of patients were male (57.2%) with an average age of 32.6 years at onset. The frontal sinus was most commonly involved (62.8%), and one pathologic sinus was most common (84.6%). Fifty-one percent of patients presented with an associated condition. This was least common in frontal sinus PD (29.7% of cases) and most common in ethmoid sinus PD (81.5%). At the time of writing, no articles have proposed a management algorithm for PD based on the number or location of sinuses involved.

- **Conclusions**: A standardized evidence-based management algorithm and classification scheme for patients with PD will not only lead to the highest-quality treatment, but…

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms or imaging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

### Sinus microbiota varies among chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes and predicts surgical outcome [^113CZpXH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent multifactorial disease in which bacteria are believed to play a role in propagating inflammation. Multiple subtypes of CRS have been described based on clinical and pathologic features, yet a detailed examination of the sinus microbiota in patients with CRS and its clinical subtypes has not been performed.

- **Objective**: We sought to examine the resident microbiota of CRS subtypes and determine whether bacterial diversity is a predictor of disease outcomes.

- **Methods**: Sinus swabs from patients with CRS and healthy subjects collected during endoscopic sinus surgery were analyzed through molecular phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA pyrosequences.

- **Results**: Fifty-six patients with CRS and 26 control subjects were studied. Biodiversity was similar between the CRS and control groups. Among the CRS subtypes examined, only two conditions (presence of purulence and comorbid condition of asthma) were associated with significant alterations in microbial community composition. In 27 patients with CRS who were followed postoperatively, those with better outcomes had more diverse bacterial communities present at the time of surgery, along with higher relative abundances of Actinobacteria.

- **Conclusion**: Analysis of microbiota in a large cohort reveals that particular CRS phenotypes (asthma and purulence) are characterized by distinct compositions of resident bacterial communities. Bacterial diversity and composition are predictors of surgical outcomes, promoting the concept of community ecology in patients with CRS.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part I. Evaluation [^111DS9Ni]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although it is often caused by viruses, it can sometimes be caused by bacteria, a condition known as acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are similar to those of a prolonged viral upper respiratory infection, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis challenging.

Because two-thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infections improve within seven days, antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet specific clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement.

Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended for diagnosing uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography can play a role in the management of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^111D9Pho]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract illnesses are common during childhood and require frequent medical care. Acute rhinosinusitis frequently occurs as a complication of acute viral upper respiratory infections. Children with acute rhinosinusitis constitute approximately 6.5% to 13% of the patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses, and some acute rhinosinusitis patients need medical care. Although acute rhinosinusitis is a common pediatric disease, its etiology remains unknown.

A few studies have reported the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens through microbiological analysis of sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. However, no study has comprehensively assessed viral and bacterial pathogens through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the microbiology of acute pediatric rhinosinusitis through molecular biological analysis.

### Rhinosinusitis: Developing guidance for clinical trials [^111EocuR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The Rhinosinusitis Initiative was developed by five national societies. The guidance document is an expansion of the 2004 publication, "Rhinosinusitis: Establishing Definitions for Clinical Research and Patient Care" and provides templates for clinical trials in antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and symptom-relieving therapies for the following: (1) acute presumed bacterial rhinosinusitis, (2) chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, (3) CRS with nasal polyps, and (4) classic allergic fungal rhinosinusitis.

In addition to the templates for clinical trials and proposed study designs, the Rhinosinusitis Initiative has developed six appendices, which address:

- **Health outcomes**: Focused on assessing patient recovery and quality of life.
- **Nasal endoscopy and staging of CRS**: Detailing procedures and evaluation methods for CRS.
- **Radiologic imaging**: Recommendations for imaging techniques to accurately diagnose rhinosinusitis.
- **Microbiology**: Guidelines on identifying pathogens involved in rhinosinusitis.
- **Laboratory measures**: Standardized tests for assessing sinus health.
- **Biostatistical methods**: Statistical techniques for analyzing trial data.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis executive summary [^115sZDcs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management (including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function), and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### The accuracy of symptom-based definition of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117DR6Z1]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Currently, the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a symptom-based definition. This study aims to study, verify, and evaluate the predictive value of the symptom-based definition of CRS, comparing this with objective tests.

- **Methods**: Seven hundred and sixty-eight adults, referred from primary care centers as patients who met the definition of CRS, were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to their allergic status and subjected to nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) on the same day.

- **Results**: The results showed that 73.15% of the nonallergic patients with symptom-based diagnosed CRS and 65.34% of the allergic patients with symptom-based diagnosed CRS had no CT and endoscopic pathology (Endoscopic score 0 + CT score 0). Nasal discharge was the most common major symptom in all patients from both groups who had pathologic endoscopic and/or CT scan scores.

- **Conclusions**: It is well established that symptoms are very important in the diagnosis of CRS. However, two major symptoms are insufficient for diagnosis. Therefore, endoscopy and CT have important differential diagnostic roles. Our study showed that in patients with three major symptoms, CT pathology may be sufficient for a definitive diagnosis. However, in patients with two major symptoms such as nasal discharge and/or low-grade nasal polyposis, endoscopy becomes considerably more important due to inspective findings. If no endoscopic findings are found, the importance of the CT scans is increased.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates — defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary — in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit [95% CI: -4.2, 10.0 for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg].

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population with specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit, 22 days post-treatment.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in adults [^114AXRN3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis. By convention, the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis are similar to those of acute rhinosinusitis but last more than 8 weeks. Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and computed tomography scan of the sinuses or rhinoscopy. Treatment options are numerous and, for the most part, not evidence-based. They include antibiotics, nasal or oral corticosteroids, antihistamines, nasal lavage, decongestants, immunotherapy, and surgery. Which diagnostic and therapeutic options to exercise when is the focus of this article.

### Definitions of relapse in trials comparing antipsychotic maintenance with discontinuation or reduction for schizophrenia spectrum disorders: A systematic review [^114dW1JU]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Avoidance of relapse is the main aim of long-term antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, yet how 'relapse' is defined in trials is not well-known.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of definitions of relapse in trials of continuous antipsychotic treatment compared with discontinuation, intermittent treatment, or dose reduction for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Trials were identified from previous Cochrane reviews and a new search. The quality of relapse definitions was rated in terms of reliability and clinical relevance, and associations between quality of definitions and trial characteristics and outcome were explored.

- **Results**: We identified 82 reports of 81 trials that employed 54 different definitions of relapse. There were 33 definitions in the 35 trials published since 1990, with recent trials employing complex definitions often involving alternative criteria. Only ten primary definitions of relapse required the presence of psychotic symptoms in all cases, and only three specified this in combination with a measure of overall severity or functional decline. Only two definitions specified a duration longer than two days. Relapse definitions were rated as showing good reliability in 37 trials, but only seven showed good clinical relevance. Six trials with definitions that were both reliable and clinically relevant were slightly longer but did not differ from remaining trials in other characteristics or overall or relative risk of relapse.

- **Conclusions**: Antipsychotic trials define relapse in numerous different ways, and few definitions are uniform across studies.

### Canadian clinical practice guidelines for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^114VESDS]. Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery = Le Journal d'Oto-Rhino-Laryngologie et de Chirurgie Cervico-Faciale (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the RS-CEG 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining a CT of the sinuses, preferably in the coronal view, as the imaging modality of choice in patients with CRS. It is important to interpret imaging findings in the context of clinical symptoms due to the high false-positive rates.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients with three or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after three to five days of symptoms, or seven or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available.

Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including the use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited.

### Sinus and allergy health partnership releases report on adult chronic rhinosinusitis [^114kEnYc]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The report states that chronic rhinosinusitis is an evolving area of study, with new information being assessed on an ongoing basis. Debate continues about potential etiologies, associated conditions, pathophysiology, common inflammatory mediators, and whether most cases of chronic rhinosinusitis are associated with infection. Evidence in the most recent literature supports the significant role that microbes (i.e. bacteria, fungi) play in the inflammatory process. The report discusses classification schemes, the role of potential bacterial, allergic, and fungal etiologies, and the controversies surrounding these areas of study.

### Fungal rhinosinusitis: A categorization and definitional schema addressing current controversies [^112EpW7T]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Fungal (rhino-) sinusitis encompasses a wide spectrum of immune and pathological responses, including invasive, chronic, granulomatous, and allergic disease. However, consensus on terminology, pathogenesis, and optimal management is lacking. The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology convened a working group to attempt consensus on terminology and disease classification.

- **Discussion**: Key conclusions reached were as follows:
	- Rhinosinusitis is preferred to sinusitis.
	- Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is preferred to fulminant or necrotizing and should refer to disease of less than 4 weeks duration in immunocompromised patients.
	- Both chronic invasive rhinosinusitis and granulomatous rhinosinusitis were useful terms encompassing locally invasive disease over at least 3 months duration, with differing pathology and clinical settings.
	- Fungal ball of the sinus is preferred to either mycetoma or aspergilloma of the sinuses.
	- Localized fungal colonization of nasal or paranasal mucosa should be introduced to refer to localized infection visualized endoscopically.
	- Eosinophilic mucin is preferred to allergic mucin.
	- Terms such as allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS) are imprecise and require better definition.

In particular, to implicate fungi (as in AFRS and EMRS), hyphae must be visualized in eosinophilic mucin, but this is often not processed or examined carefully enough by histologists, reducing the universality of the disease classification. A schema for subclassifying these entities, including aspirin.

### Diagnostic criteria for a curable form of chronic rhinosinusitis: The mucous recirculation syndrome [^113eFc23]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, nonallergic rhinosinusitis (rhinopathy) is a common diagnosis of exclusion. The mucous recirculation syndrome is one incompletely defined condition that masquerades as nonallergic rhinopathy. Mucous recirculation syndrome, a curable condition, should be differentiated from nonallergic rhinopathy. The underdiagnosis of this condition is due in part to a lack of diagnostic criteria. In this article, we review the medical literature to better characterize mucous recirculation syndrome and to establish diagnostic criteria for it.

### Centrofacial cutaneous and oral ulcerations associated with pansinusitis [^117Bc32s]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A 56-year-old Vietnamese woman presented with worsening chronic pansinusitis with progressive oral and cutaneous involvement. For the previous 8 months, she had undergone multiple endoscopic submucosal resections of the nasal turbinates. Despite debridement and many courses of oral and intravenous antibiotics, her clinical course worsened. Although further tests were pending, the dermatology department was consulted. On the day of the consultation, a physical examination showed diffuse centrofacial edema, ulceration of the right alar groove (Fig 1), and necrosis of her soft palate (Fig 2). A punch biopsy of the skin adjacent to the ulcer was performed, and the dermal infiltrate stained CD56+ (Fig 3).

- **Question 1**: Which is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Rhinosporidiosis
	- B. Nasal extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL)
	- C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
	- D. Extranasal ENKTL
	- E. Paracoccidioidomycosis

- **Answers**:
	- A. Rhinosporidiosis – Incorrect. This is a chronic infection caused by the fungus *Rhinosporidium seeberi*. This could be included as a differential diagnosis due to the frequent involvement of the nasal turbinates and lack of improvement with antibiotic therapy; however, the tissue biopsy did not show fungal involvement.
	- B. Nasal ENKTL – Correct. The anatomic distribution of nasal ENKTL includes primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract and nose. The signs and symptoms and diagnostic markers such as CD56+, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytotoxic proteins, along with the presence of a midline oral lesion, confirm the diagnosis. The cutaneous involvement is secondary to the…

### Chronic rhinosinusitis pathogenesis [^114xDzAh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic rhinosinusitis:

- **Definition**: CRS is defined as evidence of inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa for more than 12 weeks, characterized by sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and a decreased sense of smell.

- **Pathophysiology**: A complex interplay of host factors, including defects in mechanical, innate, and adaptive components of the immune system, and environmental factors, such as allergens, toxins, and microbial agents, have been implicated in the development of CRS.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include persistent sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and a decreased sense of smell.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CRS is not associated with increased mortality.

### What's that smell? A pictorial review of the olfactory pathways and imaging assessment of the myriad pathologies that can affect them [^112399jW]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is common, and the severity of chronic sinusitis is correlated with reduced olfactory bulb volumes. Sinonasal polyposis often coexists with chronic rhinosinusitis. The role of CT is to assess the pattern of sinonasal drainage impairment, to guide potential endoscopic approach. Prompt diagnosis allows for early treatment, which can increase olfactory bulb volumes and improve the patient's sense of smell. Mucosal thickening and sinus opacification can occur in both acute and chronic sinusitis. The presence of an air-fluid level distinguishes the acute form from the chronic form.

Fungal sinusitis can be either non-invasive (subcategorized as allergic or fungal ball/mycetoma-forming) or invasive (subcategorized as acute invasive, chronic invasive, or the very infrequently occurring chronic granulomatous). Allergic non-invasive fungal sinusitis is most common. Although olfactory dysfunction is not considered part of the diagnostic criteria, patients can experience significant olfactory disturbance. It is characterized by the presence of hyperdense serpiginous fungal elements (which can even be calcified), completely opacifying and expanding/remodeling the sinus.

A 20-year-old patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) complicated by pansinusitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and diabetes presented to the local emergency department after an episode of large-volume hemoptysis at home. At baseline, she had advanced lung disease (FEV1, 0.97 L; 31% predicted) and upper lobe-predominant fibrocavitary changes. She was intermittently followed at a regional lung transplant center. She was previously evaluated for transplant but was not listed at the time of this presentation because of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection. She had never used tobacco, and there were no reports of recreational inhaled drug use. Her mother had CF, and one of her brothers died in 2018 at age 24 of respiratory failure resulting from the disease.

### Bilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis complicating acute unilateral pansinusitis in a 15-year-old boy [^115RpCH2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare and potentially fatal complication of acute sinusitis. Therefore, timely diagnosis and management are essential in preventing death and neurological disability. Here, we describe the case of a pediatric patient with bilateral CST secondary to acute unilateral pansinusitis, which presented with rapidly progressing bilateral periorbital edema. Initial imaging was negative. This case serves to emphasize the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion when managing pediatric patients with suspected CST who exhibit persistent symptoms. Expeditious investigation and management of our patient in this case resulted in a positive outcome, with resolution of symptoms and no residual neurological deficit.

### Criteria and definitions for the radiological and clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults for use in clinical trials: international consensus recommendations [^1165Nt42]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to both a clinical disease and a radiological appearance that has multiple causes and can be associated with a range of conditions. Disease heterogeneity and the absence of standardized definitions have hampered clinical trials of treatments for bronchiectasis and are important challenges in clinical practice. In view of the need for new therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis to reduce the disease burden, we established an international taskforce of experts to develop recommendations and definitions for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults to facilitate the standardization of terminology for clinical trials.

Systematic reviews were used to inform discussions, and Delphi processes were used to achieve expert consensus. We prioritized criteria for the radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis and suggest recommendations on the use and central reading of chest CT scans to confirm the presence of bronchiectasis for clinical trials. Furthermore, we developed a set of consensus statements concerning the definitions of clinical bronchiectasis and its specific signs and symptoms, as well as definitions for chronic bacterial infection and sustained culture conversion.

The diagnosis of clinically significant bronchiectasis requires both clinical and radiological criteria. These expert recommendations and proposals should help to optimize patient recruitment into clinical trials and allow reliable comparisons of treatment effects among different interventions for bronchiectasis. Our consensus proposals should also provide a framework for future work in this field.

In this direction and from a clinical point of view, involvement of upper airway disease should also be considered in every patient with asthma in the light of a precision medicine approach, as it has been identified as a treatable trait that needs to be assessed and treated to improve outcome.

The aim of this study was to investigate, first, the prevalence of sinonasal diseases such as rhinitis (allergic or nonallergic) and CRS (CRSwNP and CRS without nasal polyps [CRSsNP]) in patients with asthma, and second, the phenotype characteristics that are significantly associated with asthma severity and control.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: Background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely, some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases.

Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms — especially those with unilateral facial pain — regardless of duration of illness.

1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections.
2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.
3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases.
4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms — especially those with unilateral facial pain — regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens should be used.

### What's that smell? A pictorial review of the olfactory pathways and imaging assessment of the myriad pathologies that can affect them [^1163DUsL]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Coronal bone window CT images of three different patients with sinonasal disease present distinct features:

- **51-year-old female with sinusitis**: She has a 4-year history of nasal congestive symptoms and anosmia. The imaging shows pansinusitis with complete opacification of the paranasal sinuses. The bilateral nature of the disease suggests benignity, whereas the rarefaction and thinning of the bony architecture (indicated by arrows) indicate a more chronic process.

- **70-year-old female with sinonasal carcinoma**: This patient presents with bloody nasal discharge and right nasal blockage. The unilateral opacification is suspicious for a malignant process. There is notable bony destruction of the inferior turbinate, shown by the arrows, which differentiates from rarefaction when associated with unilateral disease. Histology confirmed sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma in this case.

- **70-year-old female with malignant melanoma**: Similar symptoms of nasal congestion were observed in this patient. The imaging in this case also showed unilateral opacification suggestive of malignancy, with bony destruction of the inferior turbinate. Histology distinguished this as malignant melanoma.

An incidental note is made of bilateral maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts in the sinonasal carcinoma case (b). These are identified by their rounded, convex contour, and fluid density (indicated by arrowhead), contrasting the concave maxillary mucosal thickening seen in the malignant melanoma case (c), highlighted by the arrowhead.

### Clinical practice guideline: Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116FFPkX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning preoperative assessment, the AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a CT with a fine-cut protocol in an adult candidate for sinus surgery. If not already available, this CT should be used to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning.

### Centrofacial cutaneous and oral ulcerations associated with pansinusitis [^116sJJM4]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Patient demographic affected by ENKTL**: The most commonly affected demographic by ENKTL predominantly includes middle-aged men in the fifth and sixth decades. Age is a vital prognostic factor, with patients older than 60 years tending to have a poorer prognosis. Cases are rare in the United States and Europe and are more commonly seen in Asia and in South and Central America.

	- **A. A 57-year-old man from Peru**: Correct. This option aligns with the typical demographic profile of ENKTL.
	- **B. A 64-year-old woman from Malaysia**: Incorrect. Although the patient is from Asia and fits the age demographic, she is a woman. A male patient of a similar age would be more likely.
	- **C. A 23-year-old woman from Germany**: Incorrect. This patient is from Europe, where cases of ENKTL are rare. Moreover, the patient is a woman, and her age is much less than the typical age at which patients present with ENKTL.
	- **D. A 36-year-old man from the United States**: Incorrect. Although a male, this patient is from the United States, where cases of ENKTL are rare. Moreover, his age is much less than the typical age at which patients present with ENKTL.
	- **E. A 25-year-old man from China**: Incorrect. Although a male and from Asia, this patient is not the best answer choice, given the observed typical demographic profile of patients with ENKTL.

### Elimination of pain improves specificity of clinical diagnostic criteria for adult chronic rhinosinusitis [^112673aX]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the elimination of pain improves the accuracy of clinical diagnostic criteria for adult chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Methods**: History, symptoms, nasal endoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) results were analyzed for 1,186 adults referred to an academic otolaryngology clinic with a presumptive diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis. Clinical diagnosis was rendered using the 1997 Rhinosinusitis Taskforce (RSTF) Guidelines and a modified version that eliminates facial pain, ear pain, dental pain, and headache.

- **Results**: Four hundred seventy-nine subjects (40%) met the inclusion criteria. Among subjects positive by RSTF guidelines, 45% lacked objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation by CT, 48% by endoscopy, and 34% by either modality. Applying modified RSTF diagnostic criteria, 39% lacked sinonasal inflammation by CT, 38% by endoscopy, and 24% by either modality. Using either abnormal CT or endoscopy as the reference standard, modified diagnostic criteria yielded a statistically significant increase in specificity from 37.1% to 65.1%, with a nonsignificant decrease in sensitivity from 79.2% to 70.3%. Analysis of comorbidities revealed temporomandibular joint disorder, chronic cervical pain, depression/anxiety, and psychiatric medication use to be negatively associated with objective inflammation on CT or endoscopy.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical diagnostic criteria overestimate the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis. Removing facial pain, ear pain, dental pain, and headache increased specificity without a concordant loss in sensitivity.

### Signs and symptoms that differentiate acute sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection [^111vyZuJ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Differentiating acute bacterial sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is challenging; 20% to 40% of children diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria likely have an uncomplicated URI. The objective of this study was to determine which signs and symptoms could be used to identify the subgroup of children who meet clinical criteria for sinusitis but who nevertheless have a viral URI.

We obtained sinus radiographs in consecutive children meeting a priori clinical criteria for acute sinusitis. We considered the subgroup of children with completely normal sinus radiographs to have an uncomplicated URI despite meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for sinusitis. We examined the utility of signs and symptoms in identifying children with URI.

Of 258 children enrolled, 54 (20.9%) children had completely normal radiographs. The absence of green nasal discharge, the absence of disturbed sleep, and mild symptoms were associated with a diagnosis of URI. No physical exam findings were particularly helpful in distinguishing between children with normal versus abnormal radiographs.

Among children meeting criteria for the diagnosis of acute sinusitis, those with mild symptoms are significantly more likely to have a URI than those with severe symptoms. In addition to assessing overall severity of symptoms, practitioners should ask about sleep disturbance and green nasal discharge when assessing children with suspected sinusitis; their absence favors a diagnosis of URI.

### The sinonasal outcome test-22 or European position paper: Which is more indicative of imaging results [^112zARHr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Our study assessed symptoms alone separately from symptoms with a specified duration of at least 3 months. The relationship between subjective symptoms and objective imaging findings was similar in both cases. However, in other cases, the serial addition of diagnostic characteristics may change the ultimate odds of disease. We assessed symptoms and duration in a stepwise fashion for this reason, as well as because the SNOT-22 instrument classically focuses on the preceding 4 weeks rather than 3 months. We found that the separately reported duration of sinonasal problems did not increase the successive likelihood of SNOT-22 nasal domain scores or EPOS-defined symptoms in predicting an abnormal Lund-Mackay imaging result within the study's context. Overall, the present data demonstrated that symptoms alone could not strongly predict CT findings of chronic rhinosinusitis, suggesting utility in corroboration of findings.

This study has limitations. These include taking place at a single academic institution and using just two different measures of patients' symptoms, SNOT-22 and EPOS. Moreover, while our study has implications for telehealth delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, it does not directly study the use of SNOT-22 and EPOS during telehealth visits. This may be a benefit as our "gold standard" is the diagnostic capability and timing we had prior to pandemic-related limitations. In addition, Lund-Mackay thresholds of import are not definitively established, and so we evaluated two proposed inflection points, which have limitations.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

The 14 developed recommendations address:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Focused on adult rhinosinusitis.
- **Appropriate use of ancillary tests**: Utilized to confirm diagnosis and guide management, including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function.
- **Judicious use of therapy**: Emphasizing both systemic and topical therapy.

An emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised states, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is necessary due to new clinical trials, newly conducted systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures.

The guideline update group represented disciplines from otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, and family medicine.

### Acute proptosis secondary to bilateral pansinus mucopyocele with orbital compartment syndrome: A rare presentation, its management and outcome [^117NdB5h]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old Indian female presented with forward protrusion of the left eye for one week, associated with progressive diminution of vision. The patient had undergone sinus surgery for nasal polyposis a year ago. On examination, there was severe proptosis and limitation of extraocular movements in all gazes. A CT scan revealed a heterogeneous expansile mass arising from the left fronto-ethmoidal sinus and infiltrating the left orbit. MRI showed T2-hyperintense, peripherally enhancing areas in the bilateral nasal cavity (right > left), bilateral ethmoidal sinuses, and frontal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses.

Otorhinolaryngology consultation was sought, and in view of vision-threatening proptosis — with likely orbital compartment syndrome — emergent endoscopic guided exploration and orbital decompression was undertaken. Rapid relief of signs and symptoms was achieved, with normal vision, extraocular movements, and resolution of proptosis. Cytology and microbiology ruled out infectious or malignant etiology and helped in resolving a diagnostic dilemma. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of mucopyocele and the follow-up period was uneventful.

### COSMIN systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [^112RALnD]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is the most frequently used scale to rate the symptoms of schizophrenia. It was developed in the 1980s by Kay et al. when it became clear that negative symptoms are at least as significant, if not more significant, than the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. For example, Crow hypothesized that there is a type I schizophrenia characterized by positive symptoms and a good response to antipsychotic drugs, and a type II schizophrenia predominated by negative symptoms and associated with a poorer outcome. Similarly, Andreasen coined the terms positive and negative schizophrenia. In practice, the acute phase is often dominated by positive symptoms, while negative symptoms develop later, and some of these negative symptoms may be the result of extrapyramidal side effects.

At that time, the most commonly used 18-item version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) did not sufficiently cover negative symptoms. Therefore, a new scale had to be developed. Following the two-dimensional positive versus negative symptoms illness concept and adding a third domain for measuring general psychopathology, the PANSS was created. It is a synthesis of all 18 items of the BPRS with 12 items from the 32-item Psychopathology Rating Schedule (PRS), which Kay and colleagues had put together in the 1970s without, however, following valid scale-development methods. In order to improve on the BPRS, the severity levels of each of the 30 PANSS items were anchored by clear descriptions. Thus, the PANSS consists of three subscales: positive scale, negative scale, and a general psychopathology scale.

### Fungal sinusitis: histologic spectrum and correlation with culture [^116SM5GS]. Human Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Fungi are important etiologic agents of sinusitis. However, features of fungal sinusitis, including the histologic spectrum, diagnostic mishaps, incidence, and fungal types, have not been systematically studied. From 1996 through 2001, a total of 788 surgical pathology sinus specimens from 384 cases were retrieved. Fungal sinusitis was diagnosed in 58 specimens (7%) from 47 cases (12%).

- **Categories of fungal sinusitis**:
	- Allergic fungal sinusitis was identified in 34 cases, characterized by copious mucin, abundant eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals (so-called allergic mucin), with rare noninvasive fungal hyphae.
	- Mycetoma/fungus ball was found in 11 cases, characterized by tightly packed fungal hyphae without allergic mucin or tissue invasion.
	- Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis was present in 1 case, characterized by tissue granulomas with fungal hyphae.
	- Acute fulminant fungal sinusitis was identified in 1 case, characterized by fungal vascular invasion.

The diagnosis was initially missed in 16 out of 34 cases (47%) of allergic fungal sinusitis despite typical features. Incorrect classification was noted in 47% of cases. Sixty-seven percent of cases had positive fungal cultures, with dematiaceous fungi being the most common. Allergic fungal sinusitis accounted for the majority of fungal sinusitis cases. Although misdiagnosis or incorrect classification is rather frequent, awareness of the distinctive morphologic features of this entity may prevent these errors.

### Comparing early signs and basic symptoms as methods for predicting psychotic relapse in clinical practice [^117MDe3M]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

- **How did people describe basic symptoms**: The eighteen most frequently self-reported basic symptoms are shown in Table 2, with example quotations. A further 15 basic symptoms, not listed in the table, were reported by only one participant each. Thus, 73% (33/45) of basic symptoms listed in the SPI-A were specifically identified as beginning or increasing during the period before relapse, rather than at other times. The quotations from participants provide rich, authentic descriptions of basic symptoms, which will be used to design items for a self-report measure.

- **What is the best way of identifying basic symptoms: in-depth interview or verbal checklist**: Twice as many participants reported ≥ 1 basic symptom during the verbal checklist (69.6%) than during the in-depth interview (34.8%), a statistically significant difference (χ² = 6.40, p = 0.022). The number of basic symptoms reported in the verbal checklist (Median = 2, IQR = 0,3) was also significantly higher (z = 2.87, p = 0.004) than in the in-depth interview (Median = 0, IQR = 0,1).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). High credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. This includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

### Subdural empyema and unilateral pansinusitis due to a tooth infection [^1113XGci]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Paranasal sinus infections are very common. Dental infections, tumors, and anatomical malformations can cause unilateral sinusitis. Most cases can be treated without complications; however, rare life-threatening intracranial complications can occur. Generally, an intracranial complication progresses rapidly and can cause meningismus, focal neurological disorders, loss of consciousness, and seizures. In such cases, an emergency craniotomy and concurrent sinus surgery are required. This article presents a 16-year-old patient with pansinusitis and subdural empyema that developed following a dental abscess.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^1128B1i8]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend diagnosing CRS in the presence of at least two of the following cardinal symptoms for ≥ 3 continuous months, along with objective criteria on nasal endoscopy or CT:

- **Nasal blockage**: obstruction or congestion
- **Nasal drainage**: anterior or posterior
- **Facial pain** or pressure
- **Hyposmia**

These criteria are essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of the condition.

### Evolution in the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis: Current indications and pitfalls [^1164dpQt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) consists of a range of inflammatory conditions in the sinuses that can result in clinical symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology and its relationship to lower airway disease are complex. Definitions of CRS can serve more as an indication for potential surgical intervention rather than a marker of disease state. CRS can be asymptomatic and may require medical management to avoid disease progression and minimize the risk of lower airway disease.

Endoscopic surgery has undergone significant evolution and refinement, but the most common surgical complication remains persistent inflammation and disease recurrence. It is important to recognize that surgery alone rarely cures CRS, and patients require long-term medical therapy for continued asymptomatic inflammation. Careful postoperative care and endoscopic follow-up are key to ensuring optimal surgical outcomes and reducing the risk of revision surgery.

Future work on CRS endotypes will allow the discovery of new therapies to treat CRS, as well as refine indications for medical or surgical intervention and postoperative care.
