## Question

Npi indications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about NPI indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "NPI" stands for in this context. Then, I should verify the regulatory basis and scope of NPI use. Next, I will identify who must obtain an NPI and who is exempt. After that, I should review how NPIs are assigned and maintained. Finally, I will synthesize practical indications and implications for clinicians and organizations, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the acronym. In healthcare administration, NPI stands for National Provider Identifier, a unique 10-digit numeric identifier established under HIPAA to standardize provider identification across all health plans and clearinghouses, replacing legacy payer-specific IDs.

> I need to check the regulatory foundation. The NPI was mandated by HIPAA and is used in standard electronic transactions; it contains no embedded intelligence about provider type or location, which helps ensure privacy and interoperability across systems.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who needs one. I should confirm the scope. NPIs are required for healthcare providers that conduct electronic transactions covered by HIPAA, including individual practitioners, physician groups, hospitals, laboratories, nursing homes, health plans, and suppliers like pharmacies and medical supply companies; this aligns with CMS guidance and the original rulemaking description.

> Wait, let me verify who is exempt. Administrative and support personnel who do not provide healthcare services — such as billing staff, housekeeping, and orderlies — do not obtain NPIs; this distinction is explicit in the federal description of covered entities versus non-covered workers.

> Next, I should review how NPIs are assigned. Let me think about enumeration. NPIs are issued by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System; Medicare providers were initially enumerated automatically from existing HCFA data, while other providers apply via online or bulk processes through designated enumerators, and the NPI remains with the individual or organization regardless of practice location or employment changes.

> I will now examine practical indications and why clinicians need an NPI. Clinicians need an NPI to submit claims, prescribe medications, coordinate benefits, appear in provider directories, and link records across systems; it is also used for program integrity, quality reporting, and public registries, which operationalizes HIPAA's standardization goals in everyday practice [^111DstGH].

> But wait, what if the user meant something else by "NPI"? I should double-check for ambiguity. In some clinical contexts, "NPI" could be misread as "noninvasive positive pressure ventilation" or "neuromuscular pacing", yet the documents provided consistently point to the administrative National Provider Identifier rather than ventilatory modalities; thus, the correct interpretation here remains the HIPAA NPI [^111DstGH] [^115Yxoyy].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the core answer succinctly. The indication for obtaining an NPI is that any healthcare provider — individual or organization — that conducts standard electronic transactions under HIPAA must have one; this includes clinicians, hospitals, labs, health plans, and suppliers, whereas purely administrative staff do not, and the NPI is permanent and portable across settings [^111DstGH] [^115Yxoyy].

---

The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is **required for all healthcare providers** who conduct electronic transactions covered by HIPAA, including physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and medical supply companies [^111DstGH]. It is also needed for **billing, prescribing, and credentialing** activities. NPIs are not required for administrative or support staff who do not provide direct patient care. The NPI is a unique, permanent identifier used across all health plans and clearinghouses to streamline administrative processes and ensure accurate provider identification [^115Yxoyy].

---

## Who needs an NPI?

The following **healthcare providers are required to obtain an NPI**:

- **Individual healthcare providers**: Physicians, dentists, nurses, therapists, chiropractors, pharmacists, and other licensed healthcare professionals who provide medical services or supplies [^111DstGH].

- **Healthcare organizations**: Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, medical supply companies, and other entities that provide healthcare services or supplies [^111DstGH].

- **Health plans**: Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other health plans that engage in standard electronic transactions [^111DstGH].

---

## Specific indications for obtaining an NPI

NPIs are **required in the following scenarios**:

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Billing and claims submission | Required for submitting healthcare claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers [^115Yxoyy] |
| Electronic prescribing | Necessary for electronic prescription transactions [^notfound] |
| Credentialing and provider enrollment | Required for enrollment with health plans, hospitals, and other healthcare organizations [^notfound] |
| Coordination of benefits | Used to identify providers in coordination of benefits transactions [^115Yxoyy] |
| Internal administrative purposes | Used by healthcare organizations for internal record-keeping and provider identification [^115Yxoyy] |

---

## Who does not need an NPI?

Administrative and support staff who do not provide direct patient care — such as billing personnel, housekeeping staff, and orderlies — **do not need an NPI** [^111DstGH].

---

## Consequences of not having an NPI

Failure to obtain an NPI can result in:

- **Delayed or denied claims**: Healthcare claims may be delayed or denied, resulting in financial losses for providers and organizations [^notfound].

- **Inability to participate in electronic transactions**: Providers may be unable to participate in standard electronic transactions, limiting their ability to conduct business efficiently [^notfound].

- **Legal and regulatory non-compliance**: Non-compliance with HIPAA regulations may result in legal and regulatory penalties [^notfound].

---

## Process for obtaining an NPI

Healthcare providers can obtain an NPI by **completing an online application** through the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) website [^115Yxoyy]. The application process requires providers to submit personal and professional information, including their name, date of birth, social security number, and professional credentials. Once assigned, the NPI is permanent and does not change, even if the provider changes practices or works in different settings [^115Yxoyy].

---

The NPI is a **unique identifier required for healthcare providers** who conduct electronic transactions covered by HIPAA. It is used for billing, prescribing, credentialing, and other administrative purposes, and failure to obtain an NPI can result in significant consequences for providers and organizations.

### Noninvasive electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation in critically ill patients: a feasibility study [^113ChP29]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Conduct of the Study

The initial study design (Identifier:) aimed at different stimulation training protocols: bid, tid, or five times per day until extubation or day 10. However, after the mandatory reapproval of medical devices in the European Union (renewed European Union law 2017/745), only a bid timing could be executed for this training protocol, and the data presented herein are based solely on this group.

To gather the necessary data, the intervention group (n = 5) received 15 min of bilateral transcutaneous NEPNS sessions bid, whereas the control group (n = 6) was not stimulated. Fifteen minutes of NEPNS were delivered as three 5-min NEPNS sessions of training, separated by at least 1 min of pause, during which the patient was ventilated again using the same mechanical ventilation mode previously set by the treatment team.

The setup is presented in e-Figure 1. To identify coil positioning for stimulation (capture point [CP]), the phrenic nerve was localized according to anatomic landmarks. Contractions were validated through diaphragm ultrasound and ventilator flow adjustments. Further details on CP establishment and stimulation maintenance are provided in e-Appendix 1. The bilateral transcutaneous NEPNS stimulator specifications were equivalent to those published before (e-Appendix 1).

TV, capture loss during the session, and presence or absence of sternocleidomastoid muscle or plexus brachialis costimulations were documented. Additionally, before every stimulation session, vital signs, clinical frailty score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score, and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction results were documented. Transpulmonary pressure (P_L), airway pressure (maximal and minimal tracheal pressure), occlusion pressure (P_occ), flow, and volume were recorded and analyzed; the hardware used is described in e-Appendix 1. Patients in the control group received standard of care without any stimulations. Diaphragm ultrasound measurements were obtained in both groups from days 1 through 10 (or until extubation). The description of the ultrasound assessment and its masked analysis are presented in e-Appendix 1.

### What does it take to have a successful noninvasive ventilation program? [^112sY7VL]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has dramatically increased over the last decade. This increase is multifaceted with regard to the number of patients receiving NIV and in the increasingly varied disease conditions for which NIV is being used. Successful development of an NIV program depends on many variables, but perhaps most important is a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates experience and education. Many aspects of an NIV program must come together to make it successful for both patients and clinicians. Among these are needs assessment, institutional buy-in, use of proper equipment, staff and patient training, protocols/guidelines, and outcomes. We analyze these issues and identify characteristics that produce a successful NIV program.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^113vHFkB]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) benefit–harm profile and priority — In neuromuscular weakness, outcomes included timing of NIV, care use, patient preference, symptom improvement, and mortality, and the desirable effects of NIV were moderate while the undesirable effects were small with no clear harm, with the net benefit favoring NIV; the certainty of the evidence was very low, and given the significant impact of respiratory failure on morbidity and mortality, the testing and timing of NIV were considered a priority.

### Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist versus pressure support ventilation: a randomized controlled feasibility trial performed in patients at risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation [^112bA58Y]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Feasibility outcomes

The average recruitment rate was 1.7 patients per month. Low rates of physician enrolment refusal (15 patients, 11.8%) (Fig. 1) suggests the trial was acceptable to clinical staff. Of the 78 randomized participants, one withdrew consent and five (three NAVA, two PSV) did not commence weaning and were excluded from the adherence analysis. In the 72 participants in whom weaning was attempted, median (95% CI) proportion of time in assigned ventilator mode from randomization to extubation, death, or D28 was 83.1% (64.0 to 97.1%) (NAVA) and 100% (100 to 100%) (PSV). Compliance, i.e. ≥ 65% adherence to assigned mode, was met in 82.2% (95% CI 71.7 to 89.4%) of all participants, 66.7% of NAVA participants (95% CI 50.3 to 80.0%), and 100% of PSV participants (95% CI 89.0 to 100.0%). Mode cross-over occurred in 28 (71.8%) NAVA and 3 (8.3%) PSV participants; the proportion of time cross-over from randomization to extubation, death, or D28 was 17.7% (95% CI 3.2 to 51.4%) and 0% (95% CI 0 to 0%) respectively (Table 2).

### Noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular disease: equipment and application [^116Q9hdc]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Noninvasive support of ventilation is commonly needed in patients with neuromuscular disease. Body ventilators, which are used rarely, function by applying intermittent negative pressure to the thorax or abdomen. More commonly, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) is used. This therapy can be applied with a variety of interfaces, ventilators, and ventilator settings. The patient interface has a major impact on comfort during NPPV. The most commonly used interfaces are nasal masks and oronasal masks. Other interfaces include nasal pillows, total face masks, helmets, and mouthpieces. Theoretically, any ventilator can be attached to a mask rather than an artificial airway. Portable pressure ventilators (bi-level positive airway pressure) are available specifically to provide NPPV and are commonly used to provide this therapy. Selection of NPPV settings in patients with neuromuscular disease is often done empirically and is symptom-based. Selection of settings can also be based on the results of physiologic studies or sleep studies. The use of NPPV in this patient population is likely to expand, particularly with increasing evidence that it is life-prolonging in patients with diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Appropriate selection of equipment and settings for NPPV is paramount to the success of this therapy.

### Best clinical practices for the sleep center adjustment of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic alveolar hypoventilation syndromes [^117Bo1fs]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

General recommendations for NPPV titration — The indications, goals of treatment, and side effects of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) treatment should be discussed in detail with the patient prior to the NPPV titration study, and careful mask fitting and a period of acclimatization to low pressure prior to the titration should be included as part of the NPPV protocol; NPPV titration with polysomnography (PSG) is the recommended method to determine an effective level of nocturnal ventilatory support in patients with chronic alveolar hypoventilation (CAH), and when treatment is initiated empirically a PSG should be utilized if possible to confirm that the final NPPV settings are effective or to make adjustments as necessary; NPPV treatment goals should be individualized but typically include prevention of worsening of hypoventilation during sleep, improvement in sleep quality, relief of nocturnal dyspnea, and providing respiratory muscle rest; when obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coexists with CAH, pressure settings for treatment of the OSA may be determined during the NPPV titration PSG following AASM Clinical Guidelines for the Manual Titration of Positive Airway Pressure in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea; attended NPPV titration with PSG is the recommended method to identify optimal treatment pressure settings for patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), CAH due to restrictive chest wall disease (RTCD), and acquired or central CAH syndromes in whom NPPV treatment is indicated, and attended PSG titration allows definitive identification of an adequate level of ventilatory support for patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) in whom treatment is indicated.

### Operational definitions related to pediatric ventilator liberation [^116iARak]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Negative pressure ventilation (NPV) — definition and implementation (96% Agreement) defines NPV as A type of respiratory support in which the surface of the thorax and/or abdomen is exposed to sub-atmospheric pressure (ie, negative pressure), typically delivered through a cuirass-type device that can synchronize with patient effort to augment a reduction in pleural pressure to stimulate airflow delivery, with devices commercially available and used in some PICUs to provide respiratory support in addition to or in place of positive pressure ventilation; panelists felt that NPV constituted a form of respiratory support and that NPV should be explicitly differentiated from other forms of respiratory support, with concomitant use reported.

### Noninvasive mechanical ventilation may be useful in treating patients who fail weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation: a randomized clinical trial [^113d826S]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The combination of early extubation and noninvasive positive-pressure mechanical ventilation (NPPV) is a useful and safe alternative for ventilation in patients who fail initial weaning attempts.

- NPPV use resulted in efficient gas exchange, a tendency to decrease intensive care unit and hospital stays, and principally an important reduction in the incidence of pneumonia as well as in the need for tracheotomy.

Data extraction and management

We will use a preconfigured form in Covidence to extract study characteristics and outcome data, which we will pilot on at least one study in the review. Two review authors will extract study characteristics and intervention outcome data from the included studies.

We will extract the following study characteristics: study design and setting, characteristics of participants (e.g. disease severity and age), eligibility criteria, intervention details, the outcomes assessed, source(s) of study funding and any conflicts of interest among investigators. We will extract outcome measures of interest (predefined critical and important outcome measures) and record them under individual extraction form columns. Where outcome data are not reported in a usable way (i.e. in a way that will allow their inclusion in a meta‐analysis), we will extract them for potential inclusion in the Discussion and report them in a supplementary extracted data table. These data will be subject to qualitative description only. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. One review author will transfer data into Review Manager. A second review author will validate the outcome data entries and will spot‐check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.

When reports require translation, the translator will extract data directly using a data extraction form, or authors will extract data from the translation provided. Where possible, a review author will check numerical data in the translation against the study report.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two (or more) review authors will independently assess the risk of bias for each study/outcome using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author. We will use the RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in RCTs, which includes the following domains.

Risk of bias arising from the randomization process
Risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions
Risk of bias due to missing outcome data
Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome
Risk of bias in selection of the reported result

We will assess the risk of bias in NRSIs using the ROBINS‐I V2 tool, covering the following domains.

Risk of bias due to confounding

### Diaphragm pacing in early critical illness? A plea for a super-relaxed approach [^116xkGTN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diaphragm Pacing in the Critically Ill

Diaphragm pacing is mainly applied to maintain or improve diaphragm strength. Pacing has been applied in early critical illness, but also during the weaning phase. In experimental studies, early diaphragm pacing (initiated immediately after endotracheal intubation) provided encouraging results. For instance, in animal models, electrical phrenic nerve pacing mitigates diaphragm atrophy during controlled ventilation, but the effects on diaphragm strength are less convincing. In patients, scarce data are available on the effects of early diaphragm pacing. In a feasibility study that recruited ventilated patients < 36 hours after endotracheal intubation (n = 5), noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves appeared feasible, but adequate ventilation was achieved in only 43% of the stimulations. In another study, Morris and coworkers reported the preliminary results of the STIMULUS trial. In two patients, in the early phase of acute respiratory failure (25 hours and 114 hours on ventilators), phrenic nerve stimulation prevented diaphragm inactivity in 50% of the breaths when respiratory drive was absent during mechanical ventilation. Clinical outcomes were not reported. In addition, short-term positive effects of early diaphragm pacing on lung mechanics and hemodynamics have been reported in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in animal studies on brain function.

In the RESCUE-2 trial, pacing was applied during the weaning phase. In this trial, patients (N = 112) who were difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation (randomization ± 29 days after endotracheal intubation) were randomized between standard care and temporary electrical transvenous diaphragm pacing. Although pacing increased maximum inspiratory pressure, the primary endpoint, the duration of mechanical ventilation, was not different between groups. Currently, several clinical trials are ongoing in ICU patients (early critical illness and weaning phase) to investigate the effect of electrical or magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve on outcome.

### Acute applications of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [^115eQor9]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been used increasingly to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF). The best indications for its use are ARF in patients with COPD exacerbations, acute pulmonary edema, and immunocompromised states. For these indications, multiple controlled trials have demonstrated that therapy with NPPV avoids intubation and, in the case of COPD and immunocompromised patients, reduces mortality as well. NPPV is used to treat patients with numerous other forms of ARF, but the evidence is not as strong for its use in those cases, and patients must be selected carefully. The best candidates for NPPV are able to protect their airway, are cooperative, and are otherwise medically stable. Success is optimized when a skilled team applies a well-fitted, comfortable interface. Ventilator settings should be adjusted to reduce respiratory distress while avoiding excessive discomfort, patient-ventilator synchrony should be optimized, and adequate oxygenation should be assured. The appropriate application of NPPV in the acute care setting should lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient resource utilization.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^114thDnx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular stimulation

Neuromuscular stimulation ("pacing") uses electrical currents to generate muscle contraction in the absence of volitional efforts, making it an attractive intervention in incapacitated critically ill patients. There is growing interest in neuromuscular stimulation as a novel strategy to preserve or restore respiratory muscle activity and, in turn, to prevent or treat ICU-acquired diaphragm weakness. In addition, by inducing diaphragm contractions, neuromuscular stimulation may improve lung aeration of dependent lung regions. Pacing must be synchronized with the ventilator and potentially injurious inspiratory efforts must be avoided.

There is as yet no clinical evidence of benefit from diaphragm pacing in ICU patients. Direct stimulation of the phrenic nerves by surgically implanted electrodes has been employed to restore spontaneous ventilation in patients with high-level spinal cord injury and central hypoventilation syndrome. The feasibility of direct pacing using temporary implanted electrodes for the prevention of diaphragm dysfunction is currently under investigation in cardiac surgery patients identified to be at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation (NCT04309123). Preclinical work showed that this technique could reduce the development of diaphragm type II fiber atrophy. Recently, Reynolds et al. presented a first-in-human series of temporary transvenous phrenic nerve pacing in surgical patients and showed that this technology delivered safe and effective diaphragm contractions. This strategy is currently being studied as potential intervention for improving diaphragm strength in difficult-to-wean patients (NCT03096639). The role of transvenous phrenic nerve pacing for the prevention of diaphragm disuse atrophy remains to be investigated.

Neuromuscular stimulation strategies targeting the expiratory muscles of ICU patients are less well studied. This is surprising, as stimulation of the expiratory abdominal wall muscles can be employed noninvasively via surface electrodes placed over the abdominal wall. Feasibility of a breath-synchronized expiratory muscle stimulation technique during the early phase of mechanical ventilation was recently demonstrated with promising results and its efficacy is under investigation (NCT03453944).

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation: current status in paediatric patients [^111DYHsW]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is a treatment for patients with respiratory dysfunction accomplished by an external interface and a positive pressure ventilator. The goals of NPPV therapy are to decrease the work of breathing and to improve respiratory gas exchange. Children with respiratory dysfunction are increasingly being treated with NPPV with the belief that it is a safe and effective alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation. Reports in support of NPPV are most promising in older children with chronic respiratory failure associated with restrictive pulmonary disorders and neuromuscular weakness. In children with advanced cystic fibrosis and nocturnal hypoxaemia, NPPV appears to be superior to treatment with supplemental oxygen alone in preventing hypoventilation. The role of NPPV in children with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure is less well defined. Although early reports are encouraging, the question remains unanswered whether early application of NPPV as opposed to standard treatment reduces the likelihood or only delays the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. As young infants may not trigger the inspiratory pressure support feature of bi-level ventilators, application of NPPV with current devices is problematic in patients of this age. The horizon is promising for NPPV in the paediatric population and will likely include novel interfaces and responsive positive pressure devices better suited to the unique mechanical properties of the developing respiratory system.

### Optimal NIV Medicare access promotion: patients with thoracic restrictive disorders: a technical expert panel report from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Association for Respiratory Care, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American Thoracic Society [^112255JN]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

The existing coverage criteria for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) do not recognize the benefits of early initiation of NIV for those with thoracic restrictive disorders and do not address the unique needs for daytime support as the patients progress to ventilator dependence. This document summarizes the work of the thoracic restrictive disorder Technical Expert Panel working group. The most pressing current coverage barriers identified were: (1) delays in implementing NIV treatment; (2) lack of coverage for many nonprogressive neuromuscular diseases; and (3) lack of clear policy indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) support in thoracic restrictive disorders. To best address these issues, we make the following key recommendations: (1) given the need to encourage early initiation of NIV with bilevel positive airway pressure devices, we recommend that symptoms be considered as a reason to initiate therapy even at mildly reduced FVCs; (2) broaden CO₂ measurements to include surrogates such as transcutaneous, end-tidal, or venous blood gas; (3) expand the diagnostic category to include phrenic nerve injuries and disorders of central drive; (4) allow a bilevel positive airway pressure device to be advanced to an HMV when the vital capacity is < 30% or to address severe daytime respiratory symptoms; and (5) provide additional HMV when the patient is ventilator dependent with use > 18 h per day. Adoption of these proposed recommendations would result in the right device, at the right time, for the right type of patients with thoracic restrictive disorders.

### Noninvasive electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation in critically ill patients: a feasibility study [^117A6XA6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparisons with studies using diverse magnetic stimulators, coils, or other stimulation techniques are challenging because of inherent differences in the generated magnetic field shapes and intensities. These variations result in different effects on the phrenic nerve and diaphragm contractions, making direct comparisons limited, as previously discussed. All other techniques for phrenic nerve stimulation were classified systematically in a recent review into invasive electrical, noninvasive electrical, or noninvasive (electro)magnetic, summarizing the results and underlying benefits and disadvantages. Direct phrenic nerve stimulation during mechanical ventilation (MV) showed positive outcomes at the molecular level, including improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress. O'Rourke et alused percutaneous needle stimulation for spontaneous breathing support, akin to the third pattern we identified. They reported a significant 34.6 ± 16.9% increase in TVs for stimulated spontaneous breaths and increased diaphragm thickness by 15%. Diaphragm pacing in patients with spinal cord injury achieved successful weaning without tracheostomy in 69% of patients. Transvenous temporary diaphragm neurostimulation demonstrated significant improvements in maximum inspiratory pressure, indicating the potential for inhibiting diaphragmatic weakness during MV. The current expert consensus on lung-protective MV revolves around mitigating barotrauma through lower MV and transpulmonary pressures. Throughout the present experiments with bilateral transcutaneous NEPNS, transpulmonary pressures (maximum transpulmonary pressure [P_Lmax] and minimum transpulmonary pressure [P_Lmin]) consistently remained < 20 mbar. This adherence to the upper limit of the physiologic range (set at 15–20 mbar) further supports the feasibility of our intervention during stimulation only and PSV-supported stimulation. While during stimulation only, P_Lmax always stayed within the safety threshold, PSV-stimulated P_Lmax regularly exceeded this threshold and stimulation with spontaneous breathing in most patients. Therefore, caution in patients with spontaneous breathing is warranted.

Two infants (one in the newborn period) were treated with nasal mask bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and then both were transitioned to negative pressure chamber ventilation at several years of age because of possible midface hypoplasia. Tracheostomies were not performed. Two older children were transitioned from mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy to nasal mask BiPAP, and then in one case to negative pressure chamber ventilation, and in the other to phrenic nerve pacing.

### Average volume-assured pressure support in a 16-year-old girl with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome [^114FbfCc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is an uncommon disorder characterized by the absence of adequate autonomic control of respiration, which results in alveolar hypoventilation and decreased sensitivity to hypercarbia and hypoxemia, especially during sleep. Patients with CCHS need lifelong ventilatory support. The treatment options for CCHS include intermittent positive pressure ventilation administered via tracheostomy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, negative-pressure ventilation by body chamber or cuirass, and phrenic nerve pacing. However, it may be necessary to alter the mode of ventilation according to age, psychosocial reasons, complications of therapy, and emergence of new modes of ventilation. We present a case of a 16-year-old girl with CCHS who was mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy for 16 years and was successfully transitioned to a new modality of noninvasive ventilation (average volume-assured pressure support [AVAPS]) that automatically adjusts the pressure support level in order to provide a consistent tidal volume.

### Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as a weaning strategy for intubated adults with respiratory failure [^112Jc56S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) provides ventilatory support without the need for an invasive airway. Interest has emerged in using NPPV to facilitate earlier removal of the endotracheal tube and decrease complications associated with prolonged intubation.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence comparing NPPV and invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) weaning on clinical outcomes in intubated adults with respiratory failure.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003) and EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2003) for randomized controlled trials comparing NPPV and IPPV weaning. Additional data sources included personal files, conference proceedings and author contact.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized studies comparing early extubation with immediate application of NPPV to IPPV weaning in intubated adults with respiratory failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were planned to assess the impact of (i) excluding quasi-randomized trials and (ii) the etiology of respiratory failure on outcomes.

Main Results

We identified eleven trials, of which five were included, involving 171 participants with predominantly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Overall, the included studies were of moderate to good quality. Compared to the IPPV strategy, the NPPV strategy decreased mortality (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.76), the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85), intensive care unit length of stay (WMD -6.88 days, 95% CI -12.60 to -1.15), hospital length of stay (WMD -7.33 days, 95%CI -14.05 to -0.61), total duration of mechanical support (WMD -7.33 days, 95% CI -11.45 to -3.22) and the duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (WMD -6.79 days, 95% CI -11.70 to -1.87). There was no effect of NPPV on weaning failures or the duration of mechanical support related to weaning and insufficient data to pool adverse events or quality of life. Excluding a single quasi-randomized trial maintained the significant reduction in mortality and ventilator associated pneumonia. Subgroup analyses suggested that the mortality benefit of the NPPV approach is greater in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Summary estimates from five studies of moderate to good quality demonstrated a consistent positive effect on overall mortality. At present, use of NPPV to facilitate weaning in mechanically ventilated patients, with predominantly chronic obstructive lung disease, is associated with promising, although insufficient, evidence of net clinical benefit.

### Randomized clinical study of temporary transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation in difficult-to-wean patients [^111Sz6nv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the most frequently used life-saving technique in ICUs and is required by 20–40% of ICU patients on a daily basis. It is, however, associated with complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury and pulmonary infection. Animal experiments have also led to the description of ventilator-induced diaphragmatic lesions and weakness, so called ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Critically ill patients with difficult weaning from MV often present with diaphragm dysfunction, defined as an impaired capacity of the diaphragm to produce negative intrathoracic inspiratory pressure. The underlying mechanisms can include, but are not limited to, contractile weakness. Multiple causes beyond MV can affect the diaphragm in ICU patients, hence the wider concept of "critical illness–associated diaphragm weakness". Preventing or reversing this phenomenon could reduce the duration of MV, resulting in lower mortality in difficult-to-wean patients and lower total inpatient costs.

There is currently no established strategy to directly treat or reverse critical illness associated diaphragmatic abnormalities in critically ill patients. Experimental data recorded in animals suggest that keeping the diaphragm active during MV could be useful, and limited clinical data have suggested the usefulness of inspiratory muscle training to facilitate weaning from prolonged MV. Animal studies also suggest that superimposing diaphragm pacing during MV could mitigate experimental VIDD. In humans, the ability of diaphragm pacing to correct profound diaphragm atrophy in the absence of diaphragm denervation has been demonstrated in MV-dependent quadriplegic patients.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of diaphragm pacing with bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at the bedside (temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation [TTDN]) on weaning outcome in difficult-to-wean patients. We hypothesized that TTDN would result in a higher rate of weaning success and shortened duration of MV in relation to improved maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).

The data included in this article have been presented in part at the American Thoracic Society International Conference (May 14–19, 2021, virtual event, thematic poster presentation), the European Respiratory Society International Congress (September 5–9, 2020, virtual event, oral presentation), and the 33rd Annual Congress of the European Society of Intensive Medicine ("ESICM LIVES 2020", December 6–9, 2020, virtual event, oral presentation).

The study protocol, published before completion of the study, and three major amendments (see Table E3 in the online supplement) were approved at all sites by institutional review boards or ethical committees depending on local regulations.

### Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation as a weaning strategy for intubated adults with respiratory failure [^11658qdp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) provides ventilatory support without the need for an invasive airway. Interest has emerged in using NPPV to facilitate earlier removal of an endotracheal tube and to decrease complications associated with prolonged intubation.

Objectives

We evaluated studies in which invasively ventilated adults with respiratory failure of any cause (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-COPD, postoperative, nonoperative) were weaned by means of early extubation followed by immediate application of NPPV or continued IPPV weaning. The primary objective was to determine whether the noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) strategy reduced all-cause mortality compared with invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) weaning. Secondary objectives were to ascertain differences between strategies in proportions of weaning failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), total duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical support related to weaning, duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (ETMV), frequency of adverse events (related to weaning) and overall quality of life. We planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses to assess (1) the influence on mortality and VAP of excluding quasi-randomized trials, and (2) effects on mortality and weaning failure associated with different causes of respiratory failure (COPD vs. mixed populations).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5, 2013), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2013), proceedings from four conferences, trial registration websites and personal files; we contacted authors to identify trials comparing NPPV versus conventional IPPV weaning.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing early extubation with immediate application of NPPV versus IPPV weaning in intubated adults with respiratory failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses assessed (1) the impact of excluding quasi-randomized trials, and (2) the effects on selected outcomes noted with different causes of respiratory failure.

Main Results

We identified 16 trials, predominantly of moderate to good quality, involving 994 participants, most with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Compared with IPPV weaning, NPPV weaning significantly decreased mortality. The benefits for mortality were significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively participants with COPD (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.56) versus mixed populations (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.40). NPPV significantly reduced weaning failure (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.43); shortened length of stay in an intensive care unit (mean difference (MD) -5.59 days, 95% CI -7.90 to -3.28) and in hospital (MD -6.04 days, 95% CI -9.22 to -2.87); and decreased the total duration of ventilation (MD -5.64 days, 95% CI -9.50 to -1.77) and the duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (MD - 7.44 days, 95% CI -10.34 to -4.55) amidst significant heterogeneity. Noninvasive weaning also significantly reduced tracheostomy (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47) and reintubation (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) rates. Noninvasive weaning had no effect on the duration of ventilation related to weaning. Exclusion of a single quasi-randomized trial did not alter these results. Subgroup analyses suggest that the benefits for mortality were significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively participants with COPD versus mixed populations.

Authors' Conclusions

Summary estimates from 16 trials of moderate to good quality that included predominantly participants with COPD suggest that a weaning strategy that includes NPPV may reduce rates of mortality and ventilator-associated pneumonia without increasing the risk of weaning failure or reintubation.

### Respiratory muscle rehabilitation in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation: a targeted approach [^112DU5cd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Identifying Respiratory Muscle Weakness in ICU Patients

While researchers have used sophisticated and sometimes invasive methods to study respiratory muscle weakness in ICU patients (e.g. muscle biopsies and nerve stimulation), simple bedside measures of respiratory muscle strength do not have to be complex or invasive. For ventilator-dependent patients, features within the ventilator software can be used to obtain an approximation of maximal inspiratory pressure (e.g. "negative inspiratory force"). In this procedure, the ICU clinician coaches the patient to inhale forcefully against a "closed gate" within the system, with the resultant pressure an indication of inspiratory muscle strength. In our experience it is essential that the patient is warned that they will experience no flow of air during the attempt. While this is not a true measure of maximal inspiratory pressure, as it is not performed from residual volume (due to the presence of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]), a low "negative inspiratory force" score can flag a patient for whom inspiratory muscle weakness should be suspected. Based on both our clinical experience and the data available, scores < 30 cmH₂O should be cause for concern.

An alternative method of inspiratory muscle strength assessment in ICU patients is the Marini method where the patient exhales for 25 s through a one-way valve to reach true residual volume before maximal inhalation. This approach has been described as a strategy to obtain maximal inspiratory pressure values in ICU patients who are not responsive or cooperative. However, this method has questionable inter-rater reliability in ICU patients, and in our clinical practice this procedure can be prohibitively stressful for patients who are conscious.

Instead, we use either the method described above (i.e. ventilator-based assessment) or a handheld manometer (Fig. 1). In this latter approach, the patient is briefly disconnected from the ventilator, instructed to "empty their lungs", and the manometer is attached to the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube via a connector. The patient then inhales maximally and the best of three attempts are recorded. While maximal inspiratory pressure scores have not been found to reliably predict weaning failure, our experience has been that scores < 30 cmH₂O may indicate a degree of inspiratory muscle weakness which could impact on weaning and recovery. To obtain an estimate of the patient's inspiratory muscle strength as a percentage of predicted values (that accommodate variance due to age and sex), we recommend the normalization equations provided by Evans et al. (Table 1).

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Percocet) [^112VF2WT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

PERCOCET should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of PERCOCET for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with PERCOCET. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with PERCOCET [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS; Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Which tests may predict the need for noninvasive ventilation in children with neuromuscular disease? [^115KfigM]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal inspiratory pressure correlate with nocturnal hypoventilation in adults with neuromuscular disease, but children may not be able to perform these volitional tests.

Objective

To identify volitional and non-volitional parameters reflecting lung and respiratory muscle function which differ in children treated or not with nocturnal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).

Methods

Parameters reflecting lung function and respiratory muscle performance were measured in 27 children not treated with NPPV (Unventilated group) and 8 children treated with NPPV (Ventilated group).

Results

Concerning noninvasive tests, the Ventilated group had a rapid shallow breathing and a lower ventilatory response to carbon dioxide compared to the Unventilated group. FVC (performed by 69% of the patients) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure were lower in the Ventilated group. Concerning invasive tests, the non-volitional measurement of diaphragmatic strength by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves showed lower results in the Ventilated group as compared to the Unventilated group. Volitional tests evaluating inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength and endurance by means of the sniff and cough manoeuvres and the tension time indexes, revealed lower values in the Ventilated group as compared to the Unventilated group.

Conclusions

Several lung function and respiratory muscle function tests are lower in children treated with NPPV as compared to children not treated with NPPV. A prospective hierarchical evaluation of these tests, according to their feasibility and invasiveness, may be helpful to identify children with neuromuscular disease at risk for nocturnal hypoventilation.

### 2012 EHRA / HRS expert consensus statement on cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: implant and follow-up recommendations and management [^117B2GPd]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) left ventricular (LV) lead placement — determinants, apical positioning, and scar considerations are described as follows: The optimal placement of an LV lead represents one of the most challenging aspects of CRT device implantation, and the final position of the LV pacing lead depends on the anatomy of the cardiac venous system, the performance and stability of the pacing lead, and the absence of phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS). A significant percentage of patients do not have the typical left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology or have an indeterminate ventricular conduction defect indicating a more heterogeneous activation sequence, making the most effective LV pacing site less predictable to restore LV synchrony. Reports indicate that an apically positioned LV lead location is associated with a worse clinical outcome; mechanistically, the LV depolarization wavefront in most conduction disturbances activates the apex relatively early, whereby an apical position results in pacing a region of the heart with less delayed electrical and mechanical activation, and an apical LV lead location is often in close proximity to the right ventricular (RV) apex, reducing inter-electrode distance and inter-lead electrical separation. Clinicians have used an improvement in cardiac contractility, cardiac output, pulse pressure, or other haemodynamic variables at implantation to define an optimal site, but while this approach may have some merit, there are no randomized data to support its use in clinical decision making, there is insufficient data on the reproducibility of these acute measures, and it is uncertain if resting, intra-procedural measurements reflect the real-world ambulatory state. Pacing within myocardial scar is associated with slow conduction or block and less LV haemodynamic improvement, and both scar location and burden can be associated with poor clinical outcome.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^117QfLV7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation — indications, cautions, and initial settings: Noninvasive ventilation can improve oxygenation and ventilation by providing positive end-expiratory pressure and augmenting respiratory muscles, and patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure are more likely to benefit from noninvasive ventilation. The potential benefits should be weighed against potential adverse events, such as skin breakdown, muffled communication, claustrophobia, and inability to eat, and contraindications include facial trauma, decreased level of consciousness, severe vomiting, inability to clear secretions, and severe claustrophobia. Interventions should be administered if noninvasive ventilation is more burdensome than beneficial after a time-limited therapeutic trial (typically < 1 hour), and clinicians should be cautious about using noninvasive ventilation in the last days of life because it may be more burdensome than beneficial. When initiating noninvasive ventilation, consider starting with low inspiratory pressure (ie, 8–10 cmH₂O) and then gradually increase as tolerated, and expiratory pressure should never be above 6–8 cmH₂O unless indicated.

### Monitoring the electric activity of the diaphragm during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation: a case report [^111CfASr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managing severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be challenging, both during invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and after extubation, when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) plays an important role.

The best strategy for monitoring clinical response to NPPV after extubation is not clear. Clinical parameters, oxygen saturation, and blood gas analysis are recommended to guide whether the patient requires reintubation or can be weaned from NPPV, but the lack of objective measures of respiratory overload at the bedside may contribute to delayed reintubation and worse clinical outcomes.

Monitoring of the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) can provide objective information about the neural respiratory drive, since its amplitude reflects the neural excitation of the diaphragm. EAdi monitoring has been an important research tool to help us understand respiratory drive activation and neuro-muscular coupling.

EAdi can be captured and recorded using an esophageal catheter with multiple electrodes (Fig. 1). It is used to trigger and to provide inspiratory support proportional to the electrical activity of the diaphragm in the ventilatory mode called Neurally adjusted ventilatory Assist (NAVA). EAdi monitoring has also been used to monitor respiratory effort during the weaning phase in invasive mechanical ventilation, but not to monitor post-extubation NPPV effectiveness. We present a case of EAdi monitoring during post-extubation NPPV in a patient with an exacerbation of COPD. We followed the CARE guidelines for reporting of case reports and we obtained written approval to publish the case report from the patient.

### What is the national provider identifier (NPI)? [^111DstGH]. aspe.hhs.gov (2000). Low credibility.

What is the National Provider Identifier. Today, health plans assign identification numbers to health care providers — individuals, groups, or organizations that provide medical or other health services or supplies. The result is that providers who do business with multiple health plans have multiple identification numbers. The NPI is a unique identification number for health care providers that will be used by all health plans. Health care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses will use the NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions specified by HIPAA. The NPI was proposed as an 8-position alphanumeric identifier. However, many commenters preferred a 10-position numeric identifier with a check digit in the last position to help detect keying errors.

The NPI contains no embedded intelligence; that is, it contains no information about the health care provider such as the type of health care provider or State where the health care provider is located. Who would get an NPI. NPIs would be given to health care providers that need them to submit claims or conduct other transactions specified by HIPAA. A health care provider is an individual, group, or organization that provides medical or other health services or supplies. This includes physicians and other practitioners, physician/practitioner groups, institutions such as hospitals, laboratories, and nursing homes, organizations such as health maintenance organizations, and suppliers such as pharmacies and medical supply companies. This does not include health industry workers, such as admissions and billing personnel, housekeeping staff, and orderlies, who support the provision of health care but do not provide health care services. How would NPIs be issued.

NPIs would be issued by the National Provider System based on information entered into the NPS by one or more organizations known as "enumerators. " Enumerators would carry out a number of functions, which include entering identifying information about a health care provider into the system, performing data validation, notifying a health care provider of its NPI, and updating information about a health care provider when notified by the health care provider. What entities would be enumerators. The two most viable options are described below. The Notice of Proposed Rule Making welcomes feedback on these options, as well as on alternate solutions. Because the data needed to enumerate Medicare providers is already available in HCFA files, that information will be loaded into the National Provider System and NPIs will be assigned automatically to Medicare providers under either option described below.

Medicare providers, therefore, would not have to apply for an NPI. Option 1: A Federally-directed registry would be the enumerator of all health care providers. After the initial load of Medicare provider data and assignment of NPIs to Medicare providers, all the remaining health care providers would apply directly to the registry for an NPI. The registry could be operated by an agent or contractor. The registry would enter the provider's data into the National Provider System; the National Provider System would assign an NPI, and the registry would notify the provider of the NPI. Option 2: A combination of Federal programs, Medicaid State agencies, and a registry would be enumerators. Federal programs and Medicaid State agencies would enumerate their own health care providers by entering provider data into the National Provider System; the National Provider System would assign NPIs to the providers.

### Neuroventilatory efficiency and extubation readiness in critically ill patients [^113jRtFG]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Based on the hypothesis that failure of weaning from mechanical ventilation is caused by respiratory demand exceeding the capacity of the respiratory muscles, we evaluated whether extubation failure could be characterized by increased respiratory drive and impaired efficiency to generate inspiratory pressure and ventilation.

Methods

Airway pressure, flow, volume, breathing frequency, and diaphragm electrical activity were measured in a heterogeneous group of patients deemed ready for a spontaneous breathing trial. Efficiency to convert neuromuscular activity into inspiratory pressure was calculated as the ratio of negative airway pressure and diaphragm electrical activity during an inspiratory occlusion. Efficiency to convert neuromuscular activity into volume was calculated as the ratio of the tidal volume to diaphragm electrical activity. All variables were obtained during a 30-minute spontaneous breathing trial on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 cm H₂O and compared between patients for whom extubation succeeded with those for whom either the spontaneous breathing trial failed or for those who passed, but then the extubation failed.

Results

Of 52 patients enrolled in the study, 35 (67.3%) were successfully extubated, and 17 (32.7%) were not. Patients for whom it failed had higher diaphragm electrical activity (48%; P < 0.001) and a lower efficiency to convert neuromuscular activity into inspiratory pressure and tidal volume (40% (P < 0.001) and 53% (P < 0.001)), respectively. Neuroventilatory efficiency demonstrated the greatest predictability for weaning success.

Conclusions

This study shows that a mixed group of critically ill patients for whom weaning fails have increased neural respiratory drive and impaired ability to convert neuromuscular activity into tidal ventilation, in part because of diaphragm weakness.

### NPY modulates PYY function in the regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis [^113YKtJs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Both the neuronal-derived neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) have been implicated in the regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. However, despite similar affinities for the same Y receptors, the co-ordinated actions of these two peptides in energy and glucose homeostasis remain largely unknown.

Methods

To investigate the mechanisms and possible interactions between PYY with NPY in the regulation of these processes, we utilized NPY/PYY single and double mutant mouse models and examined parameters of energy balance and glucose homeostasis.

Results

PYY(-/-) mice exhibited increased fasting-induced food intake, enhanced fasting and oral glucose-induced serum insulin levels, and an impaired insulin tolerance, - changes not observed in NPY(-/-) mice. Interestingly, whereas PYY deficiency-induced impairment in insulin tolerance remained in NPY(-/-) PYY(-/-) mice, effects of PYY deficiency on fasting-induced food intake and serum insulin concentrations at baseline and after the oral glucose bolus were absent in NPY(-/-) PYY(-/-) mice, suggesting that NPY signalling may be required for PYY's action on insulin secretion and fasting-induced hyperphagia. Moreover, NPY(-/-) PYY(-/-), but not NPY(-/-) or PYY(-/-) mice had significantly decreased daily food intake, indicating interactive control by NPY and PYY on spontaneous food intake. Furthermore, both NPY(-/-) and PYY(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced respiratory exchange ratio during the light phase, with no additive effects observed in NPY(-/-) PYY(-/-) mice, indicating that NPY and PYY may regulate oxidative fuel selection via partly shared mechanisms. Overall, physical activity and energy expenditure, however, are not significantly altered by NPY and PYY single or double deficiencies.

Conclusions

These findings show significant and diverse interactions between NPY and PYY signalling in the regulation of different aspects of energy balance and glucose homeostasis.

### Optimizing synchronized non-invasive support: clinical management guidelines for non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist [^1112fnZJ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is an innovative ventilation mode that empowers patients to control both the timing and level of ventilatory support. By utilizing the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) as the control signal, NAVA enables synchronized non-invasive ventilation (NIV-NAVA) even in the presence of leaks, while also providing continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory pattern and drive. NIV-NAVA offers several advantages compared to conventional non-invasive ventilation, including enhanced patient-ventilator interaction and synchrony, reliable respiratory monitoring, and self-regulation of respiratory support. These features make NIV-NAVA theoretically ideal for providing effective and tailored non-invasive support to newborns with respiratory insufficiency. In clinical practice, NIV-NAVA has been successfully employed in neonates to prevent intubation, facilitate early extubation, and deliver nasal continuous positive airway pressure in a novel manner. Set up and management of NAVA has unique differences from conventional ventilation and an understanding of these is essential for successful NAVA ventilation. The efficacy of this approach in neonatal care is supported by numerous studies and clinical experiences with NIV-NAVA, demonstrating its potential to improve outcomes for infants with respiratory challenges.

### Historical and potential modern uses of negative-pressure ventilation for critically ill patients [^116RaZWz]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Negative-pressure ventilation (NPV) is a form of noninvasive respiratory support in which an external subatmospheric pressure is applied to the thorax to facilitate lung expansion. Although largely supplanted by positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) in modern-day practice, NPV has garnered renewed interest as a potential noninvasive adjunct or alternative to PPV. Appropriate patient selection would be key, particularly in the ICU setting, where NPV is generally contraindicated in patients with severe upper airway obstruction, high oxygenation requirements, or absent airway reflexes. Clinical studies have investigated the use of NPV in patients with respiratory muscle weakness, acute on chronic respiratory failure, impaired airway clearance, and in the postoperative management of cardiac surgery patients. NPV can be delivered through tank, cuirass, and jacket ventilators, with supplemental oxygen provided as needed via nasal cannula or face mask. Modern negative pressure ventilators can support both spontaneous and controlled modes, including continuous negative extrathoracic pressure, synchronized negative pressure, cyclical negative pressure, high-frequency oscillation, and biphasic ventilation. In addition to providing respiratory support, NPV may also offer hemodynamic benefits in some patients, reduce sedation requirements, and improve patient well-being in the ICU by allowing for oral intake, verbal communication, and increased mobility. Still, the use of NPV has been stymied by challenges around device ergonomics, patient comfort, and clinical familiarity. Further research is needed to better define its role in contemporary medicine in terms of patient selection, equivalency or improvement of outcomes, optimization of interface design and portability, and exploration of applications such as hybrid ventilation strategies and synchronization. This narrative review provides a comprehensive evaluation of NPV in the intensive care unit, including its historical significance, physiologic principles, modern evidence for potential clinical use, modes of delivery, and key opportunities for innovation.

### Association between a state law allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription and naloxone dispensing rates [^116tmRSz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Opioid misuse is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted prevention and treatment approach. Laws intended to protect the public may hinder access to naloxone. The implementation of a new law in Ohio, which allowed pharmacists to provide naloxone without a prescription in accordance with a physician-approved protocol, was associated with increased naloxone dispensing rates, especially in low-education and high-poverty counties. Pharmacist provision of naloxone may improve access to this important medication.

### What is my taxonomy number? [^115Yxoyy]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of the National Provider Identifier is to uniquely identify a health care provider in standard transactions, such as health care claims. NPIs may also be used to identify health care providers on prescriptions, in internal files to link proprietary provider identification numbers and other information, in coordination of benefits between health plans, in patient medical record systems, in program integrity files, and in other ways. HIPAA requires that covered entities use NPIs in standard transactions. You are a covered entity if you conduct any electronic transaction with federal health programs. Your individual NPI is yours even if your employer files the application for it. The NPI does not change when you change practices or work in different settings. You will have only one individual NPI. It will be used by all health plans who are covered entities, eliminating what are likely many provider numbers assigned by Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers at present.

CMS has created an online NPI registry where a physician, other health care provider, or organization can access NPI information. This is part of the same National Plan and Provider Enumeration System website on which NPI registry is completed. Only the health care provider data elements that are disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act are released. If you practice as a sole proprietorship, you must apply as a type I. You will have to submit your social security number rather than your employer identification number. Eligible organizations, including S corporations, may apply for an NPI as an entity Type II. Eligible individuals working within an organization, including an S corporation, may also apply for an NPI as an entity Type I. An S corporation representing only one practitioner is still eligible for a Type II NPI.

From an NPI perspective, an S corporation is no different than a limited liability corporation or any other type of corporation. You can apply for an NPI in one of three ways: The fastest and easiest way for most physicians will be completing the online application form. Complete the application online. You will need: If you have someone other than yourself complete the application, they will also need to know in what country and state you were born, your date of birth, and your social security or individual taxpayer identification number. Electronic File Interchange, also referred to as bulk enumeration, is a process by which physician and other health care providers or group of providers can have a particular organization apply for NPI on their behalf. In other words, rather than a provider or group of providers submitting a paper or web NPI application, the EFIO obtains an NPI for him/her/them.

What makes EFI so unique is that one file can contain hundreds or thousands of providers' applications. By submitting these applications both simultaneously and electronically, the administrative and financial burdens for both the provider community and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services are greatly reduced. These benefits are enhanced because EFI can also be used to change or update a provider's existing NPI information. See the CMS Electronic File Interchange Summary for more information on the EFI process. Physicians may report primary and secondary taxonomy codes in the NPI application. For instance, a family medicine physician specializing in adolescent medicine might report a primary code for family medicine, 207Q00000X, and a secondary code for adolescent medicine, 207QA0000X.

### Availability of naloxone at rural Georgia pharmacies, 2019 [^116MwPaJ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Although the legislative barrier to obtaining naloxone has been addressed in Georgia, naloxone accessibility and availability, especially in rural areas, are still limited. These findings suggest that rural communities face additional barriers related to misinformation and varying costs. Despite these barriers, pharmacists can provide their patients with high-quality care, even if they cannot directly provide naloxone. Some pharmacists identified alternative pharmacies and cost-saving options.

This study did not ask pharmacists why the medication was not stocked in their pharmacies, nor did it examine county-level predictors of naloxone access. Future work should compare the accessibility of naloxone against the rates of opioid overdoses in the county. Despite the existence of a standing order in Georgia, this study shows the necessity for further education and training to ensure the translation and execution of legislative mandates necessary to address this public health crisis.

### Noninvasive electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation in critically ill patients: a feasibility study [^116ELt3h]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Electromagnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve induces diaphragm contractions, but no coils for clinical use have been available. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of ventilation using bilateral transcutaneous noninvasive electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (NEPNS) before surgery in lung-healthy patients with healthy weight in a dose-dependent manner.

Research Question

Is NEPNS feasible in critically ill patients in an ICU setting?

Study Design and Methods

This feasibility nonrandomized controlled study aimed to enroll patients within 36 h of intubation who were expected to remain ventilated for ≥ 72 h. The intervention group received 15-min bilateral transcutaneous NEPNS bid, whereas the control group received standard care. If sufficient, NEPNS was used without pressure support to ventilate the patient; pressure support was added if necessary to ventilate the patient adequately. The primary outcome was feasibility, measured as time to find the optimal stimulation position. Further end points were sessions performed according to the protocol or allowing a next-day catch-up session and tidal volume achieved with stimulation reaching only 3 to 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW). A secondary end point was expiratory diaphragm thickness measured with ultrasound from days 1 to 10 (or extubation).

Results

The revised European Union regulation mandated reapproval of medical devices, prematurely halting the study. Eleven patients (five in the intervention group, six in the control group) were enrolled. The median time to find an adequate stimulation position was 23 s (interquartile range, 12–62 s). The intervention bid was executed in 87% of patients, and 92% of patients including a next-day catch-up session. Ventilation with 3 to 6 mL/kg IBW was achieved in 732 of 1,701 stimulations (43.0%) with stimulation only and in 2,511 of 4,036 stimulations (62.2%) with additional pressure support. A decrease in diaphragm thickness was prevented by bilateral NEPNS (P = 0.034) until day 10.

Interpretation

Bilateral transcutaneous NEPNS was feasible in the ICU setting with the potential benefit of preventing diaphragm atrophy during mechanical ventilation. NEPNS ventilation effectiveness needs further assessment.

### Naloxone accessibility under the state standing order across Mississippi [^113a3Xu9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this survey study of naloxone availability under the state standing order across Mississippi community pharmacies, despite lawful availability, naloxone was not widely accessible to patients. A total of 40.95% of all pharmacies surveyed were unwilling to dispense naloxone under the state standing order, demonstrating that despite legislative action, the standing order has not been widely adopted by pharmacy stake holders. Findings from this study also have implications for recent interventions to improve access to naloxone in the state. Mississippi State Department of Health and FDA interventions aim to make naloxone affordable and available over the counter for consumers. However, given the low standing order availability and high unwillingness to dispense naloxone observed, questions about pharmacy adoption and appropriate implementation of the over-the-counter rollout remain.
