## Question

62 yo F with mild chronic anemia (Hb 9.6), history of rheumatoid arthritis, and prior partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease is admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. She is currently taking oral warfarin for atrial fibrillation (stable INR 2.4). Infectious diseases recommends starting oral clarithromycin 500 mg BID. Is it safe to start clarithromycin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to start clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily in a 62-year-old woman with community-acquired pneumonia who is taking warfarin with a stable INR of 2.4, considering her comorbidities and surgical history. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for the drug–drug interaction between clarithromycin and warfarin. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic mechanism and the clinical magnitude of INR elevation. Next, I will assess patient-specific bleeding risk factors, including anemia, prior gastrectomy, and rheumatoid arthritis. After that, I need to check guideline-supported alternatives for CAP that avoid this interaction. Finally, I will outline a practical monitoring plan if clarithromycin is unavoidable and state a clear recommendation with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the interaction signal. Multiple authoritative sources consistently warn that clarithromycin coadministered with warfarin can cause serious hemorrhage and marked INR elevations, necessitating frequent INR monitoring when used together, which is a strong red flag for safety concerns in this setting [^06b1b94a] [^0b0a6248] [^becdb945].

> I need to check the mechanism to ensure this is not just a theoretical risk. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor; warfarin's S-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9, but clarithromycin also inhibits CYP3A4 and may affect vitamin K–producing gut flora, collectively increasing warfarin effect and INR unpredictably, which explains the clinically observed bleeding risk [^06b1b94a] [^0b0a6248].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should quantify the clinical impact. Although exact INR increases vary, case series and labeling describe dramatic INR rises and bleeding with clarithromycin–warfarin coadministration, and guideline advice emphasizes that patient responses are unpredictable, so prospective dose adjustments are unsafe and close INR monitoring is mandatory if the combination is unavoidable [^0b0a6248] [^8526a563].

> Next, I should review patient-specific bleeding risks. Mild chronic anemia at Hb 9.6 g/dL already signals reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and diminished physiologic reserve. Prior partial gastrectomy increases the risk of upper GI bleeding and may impair iron and vitamin K absorption. Rheumatoid arthritis can be associated with GI mucosal disease and NSAID use, further elevating bleeding risk. Together, these factors compound the hemorrhagic risk of supratherapeutic anticoagulation from a clarithromycin–warfarin interaction [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify guideline-concordant alternatives for CAP that avoid this interaction. ATS/IDSA recommends either a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy for nonsevere inpatient CAP; however, when a significant warfarin interaction is a concern, azithromycin is preferred over clarithromycin because azithromycin lacks meaningful CYP3A4 inhibition, and doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone are reasonable alternatives depending on comorbidities and local resistance patterns [^f30cc1d7] [^d090ada5] [^def1fc02].

> I should double-check the macrolide-specific guidance. While azithromycin has been associated with isolated case reports of INR elevation, large clinical series and FDA labeling suggest the interaction is far less consistent and less clinically significant than with clarithromycin; nonetheless, prudent monitoring is still advised, but the risk profile is distinctly lower than with clarithromycin, making azithromycin the safer macrolide choice if a macrolide is indicated [^def1fc02] [^c4a56ace].

> Let me consider the scenario if clarithromycin is absolutely necessary despite risks. If no suitable alternative exists, I would obtain a baseline INR, recheck within 2–3 days of initiation, then monitor every 2–3 days through the course and for several days after completion, anticipating the need for warfarin dose reductions and holding doses if INR rises toward or above 3.5–4.0, with a low threshold to administer vitamin K if INR is dangerously elevated, consistent with anticoagulation safety guidance [^8526a563] [^57b83930].

> But wait, what if we can avoid the interaction altogether? Given this patient's bleeding risk profile, the balance favors choosing an alternative regimen such as doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or a respiratory fluoroquinolone like levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, aligning with ATS/IDSA options for nonsevere inpatient CAP and eliminating the CYP3A4-mediated warfarin interaction risk inherent to clarithromycin [^f30cc1d7] [^d090ada5].

> I should confirm duration and stewardship considerations to ensure the plan is complete. A 5-day total course is appropriate for most CAP once the patient is clinically stable, with step-down to oral therapy when feasible; this aligns with guideline recommendations and minimizes antibiotic exposure while maintaining efficacy [^760f62a6].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit. No, it is not safe to start clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily in this patient because of the high likelihood of a clinically significant warfarin interaction with unpredictable INR elevation and bleeding, compounded by anemia, prior gastrectomy, and rheumatoid arthritis. If a macrolide is required, azithromycin is the preferred macrolide with a much lower interaction risk, but the optimal approach is to select a noninteracting alternative such as doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone and, if clarithromycin is unavoidable, institute intensive INR monitoring with a plan for dose reduction and reversal as needed [^06b1b94a] [^f30cc1d7] [^def1fc02] [^8526a563].

It is **not safe** to start clarithromycin in a 62-year-old woman with stable warfarin therapy because clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor that can cause a **clinically significant INR increase and bleeding** [^06b1b94a]. Her mild anemia and prior gastrectomy further increase bleeding risk. If clarithromycin is essential, **monitor INR within 2–3 days** of initiation and adjust warfarin as needed [^8526a563]; otherwise, use azithromycin or doxycycline, which have minimal CYP3A4 interaction, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if appropriate [^f30cc1d7] [^d090ada5].

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between clarithromycin and warfarin

Clarithromycin is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, both of which are involved in warfarin metabolism and transport. Warfarin is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4; inhibition of CYP3A4 by clarithromycin **reduces warfarin clearance**, increases plasma concentrations, and potentiates anticoagulation, leading to an elevated INR and bleeding risk [^06b1b94a] [^0b0a6248].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction

Multiple case reports and clinical studies document significant INR elevation and bleeding with clarithromycin–warfarin coadministration. The FDA explicitly warns of **serious hemorrhage and INR elevation** when clarithromycin is used with warfarin, recommending frequent INR and prothrombin time monitoring [^06b1b94a] [^0b0a6248].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

This patient has several risk factors that **amplify bleeding risk** with clarithromycin:

- **Mild anemia (Hb 9.6 g/dL)**: Reduces oxygen-carrying capacity and increases susceptibility to ischemia and bleeding complications.
- **Prior partial gastrectomy**: Alters gastric anatomy, potentially impairing absorption and increasing bleeding risk.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Associated with increased bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction and NSAID use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **advise against routine coadministration** of clarithromycin with warfarin due to the high risk of bleeding and INR instability. If clarithromycin is absolutely necessary, close INR monitoring is essential [^8526a563].

---

## Alternative antibiotic options

Given the significant interaction risk, **alternative antibiotics** should be considered:

| **Antibiotic** | **Interaction with warfarin** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Azithromycin | Minimal CYP3A4 interaction | Safe alternative |
| Doxycycline | Minimal CYP3A4 interaction | Safe alternative |
| Levofloxacin | Moderate interaction, but less pronounced than clarithromycin | Use with caution and INR monitoring |
| Moxifloxacin | Moderate interaction, but less pronounced than clarithromycin | Use with caution and INR monitoring |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If clarithromycin is deemed necessary, the following **monitoring and management strategies** are recommended:

- **Baseline INR measurement**: Document pre-clarithromycin INR.
- **Frequent INR monitoring**: Check INR within 2–3 days of initiating clarithromycin and then every 2–3 days until stable.
- **Warfarin dose adjustment**: Reduce warfarin dose preemptively by 30–50% based on clinical judgment and INR trends.
- **Patient education**: Instruct the patient to report signs of bleeding (bruising, hematuria, melena, hematemesis) promptly.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the significant pharmacokinetic interaction, documented clinical risk, and the patient's bleeding risk profile, **clarithromycin should not be started** in this patient. Alternative antibiotics such as azithromycin or doxycycline are preferred. If clarithromycin is absolutely necessary, implement intensive INR monitoring and warfarin dose adjustments to mitigate bleeding risk [^06b1b94a] [^8526a563].

14.2 Community Acquired Pneumonia

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the US to compare the efficacy of moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily) to that of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 474 patients (382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 to 35 day follow-up visit). Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95% (184/194) for moxifloxacin and 95% (178/188) for high dose clarithromycin.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the US and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin 400 mg QD for 7 to 14 days to an IV/PO fluoroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 516 patients, 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 to 30 day post-therapy visit. The clinical success rate was 86% (157/182) for moxifloxacin therapy and 89% (161/180) for the fluoroquinolone comparators.

An open-label ex-US study that enrolled 628 patients compared moxifloxacin to sequential IV/PO amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.2 g IV q8h/625 mg PO q8h) with or without high-dose IV/PO clarithromycin (500 mg BID). The intravenous formulations of the comparators are not FDA approved. The clinical success rate at Day 5 to 7 for moxifloxacin therapy was 93% (241/258) and demonstrated superiority to amoxicillin/clavulanate ± clarithromycin (85%, 239/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.9%, 13.2%)]. The clinical success rate at the 21 to 28 days post-therapy visit for moxifloxacin was 84% (216/258), which also demonstrated superiority to the comparators (74%, 208/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.6%, 16.3%)].

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin: is new always better than the old? [^656c4336]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of the four RCTs comparing efficacy of DOACs versus warfarin found the DOACs to be superior to warfarin in terms of embolic and haemorrhagic stroke but to be inferior in terms of gastrointestinal bleeding events. An important qualification was that superiority was dependent on the proportion of warfarin patients in the therapeutic window. If the average time in the therapeutic range (TTR) was < 66%, the new drugs were superior but they were not superior if average TTR of patients on warfarin was > 66% (Relative Risk = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81 vs Relative Risk = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13, P interaction = 0.022).

Three other subsequent observations raise major concerns. RCTs tend to focus on younger people with fewer comorbidities. Abrahams et al reported in 2015 that adverse events were more common in the older population. This has a plausible biological basis since excretion rates are pivotal to maintaining correct therapeutic levels. DOACs are more dangerous in people with impaired renal function. In the frail elderly population, intercurrent illness can lead to acute decline in renal function leading to excessive anticoagulation and sometimes life-threatening bleeding. Guidance suggests that renal function should be regularly checked but compliance with this guidance is thought to be poor in practice. The importance of drug–drug interactions with DOACs is underappreciated and can occur with drugs used intermittently, for example, antibiotics such as clarithromycin. The lack of validated laboratory tests to monitor the degree of anticoagulation with DOACs means that any dose reduction in patients with impaired renal function or on interacting drugs is empirical.

### Enhanced hypoprothrombinemia with warfarin due to azithromycin [^b3e6649b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of probable azithromycin-warfarin drug interaction with enhanced hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin.

Case Summary

An 83-year-old African American man stabilized on warfarin therapy (10 mg on Wednesdays, 7.5 mg on other days) developed a prolonged prothrombin time one day after starting azithromycin 500 mg. The elevated prothrombin time normalized 3 days after azithromycin was discontinued. After the initial increase in the international normalized ratio, the absence of any significant confounding factors affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in our patient and the numerous reports of such interactions indicate that an interaction between azithromycin and warfarin may have been responsible for the elevated prothrombin time seen in this patient. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse event was probably related to the combination of these drugs.

Discussion

Azithromycin, unlike erythromycin and clarithromycin, is not known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and is presumed to be the macrolide of choice in patients already on warfarin. However, previously reported cases of azithromycin-warfarin interactions support the possibility that azithromycin does interact with warfarin, although the exact mechanism is not understood.

Conclusions

Azithromycin may interact with warfarin and enhance its hypoprothrombinemic effects. This effect may be delayed for 4–8 days after a course of azithromycin has been completed. Periodic monitoring of the prothrombin time is recommended when using azithromycin in patients taking warfarin.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient initial treatment — standard regimens are stratified by comorbidity and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa risk: for patients with no comorbidities or MRSA/P. aeruginosa risk factors, use "Amoxicillin or doxycycline or macrolide (if local pneumococcal resistance is < 25%)," with dosing "Amoxicillin 1 g three times daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, azithromycin 500 mg on first day then 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, or clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily." For patients with comorbidities — defined as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia" — use "Combination therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporin AND macrolide or doxycycline" with doses "Amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg three times daily, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily, 2,000 mg/125 mg twice daily, cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily, or cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily; AND azithromycin 500 mg on first day then 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily, or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily," or "monotherapy with respiratory fluoroquinolone" at "Levofloxacin 750 mg daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily." MRSA or P. aeruginosa risk factors are "prior respiratory isolation of MRSA or P. aeruginosa or recent hospitalization AND receipt of parenteral antibiotics (in the last 90 d)."

### Potential interaction between telithromycin and warfarin [^5ed8ad05]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of warfarin-telithromycin interaction resulting in an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and hemoptysis.

Case Summary

A 73-year-old white man developed an elevated INR and mild hemoptysis as a result of an interaction between warfarin and telithromycin 800 mg/day. The INR increased from 3.1 before telithromycin was started to 11 after 5 days of telithromycin therapy. The INR returned to the therapeutic range 4 days after telithromycin was discontinued.

Discussion

Telithromycin is the first member of the macrolide subclass of ketolides and offers potential advantages over traditional macrolides/azalides for community-acquired respiratory tract infections caused by macrolide-resistant pathogens. As of July 16, 2004, bleeding complications and an increased INR as a result of an interaction between warfarin and telithromycin have not been described. Although the mechanism for this interaction remains unknown, it is suspected that it is a result of the inhibition of the metabolism of the R-isomer of warfarin, which is metabolized predominantly by CYP1A2 and less by CYP3A4. Further research is required to elucidate this issue. An objective causality assessment revealed that this adverse drug event as a result of the warfarin and telithromycin interaction was probable.

Conclusions

We recommend close monitoring of INR levels in patients on warfarin who receive telithromycin therapy in an effort to control and prevent bleeding complications.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^8acdf162]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Macrolide therapy — moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with prior exacerbations: "For patients with moderate to severe COPD, who have a history of one or more moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in the previous year despite optimal maintenance inhaler therapy, we suggest the use of a long-term macrolide to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2A)." Safety notes specify that "patients should be carefully evaluated for predisposing conditions or medications before initiating therapy," and clinicians prescribing macrolides need to consider "prolongation of the QT interval and hearing loss as well as bacterial resistance." "The duration and exact dosage of macrolide therapy are unknown." Reported signals include colonization "with organisms that were resistant to azithromycin" with colonization "not associated with an increase in COPD exacerbations or pneumonia," and "a modest increase in the risk of hearing loss… although this effect was reversible." Additionally, macrolide therapy "is suggested (grade 2A)… and clinicians should be aware of the potential for adverse effects."

### The efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^aa562715]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

An international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3–5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. Clinical success rates were maintained at follow-up, 21–28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). The 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating CAP. At follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), Haemophilus influenzae (19%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. The adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. Most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. Study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. In all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of CAP. Bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater than those of clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

14.3 Community Acquired Pneumonia

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the U.S. to compare the efficacy of moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily) to that of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 474 patients (382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 to 35 day follow-up visit). Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95% (184/194) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 95% (178/188) for high dose clarithromycin.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the U.S. and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral fluoroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 516 patients, 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 to 30 day post-therapy visit. The clinical success rate was 86% (157/182) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride therapy and 89% (161/180) for the fluoroquinolone comparators.

### Efficacy and tolerability of once-daily oral telithromycin compared with clarithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^8234ebcd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Telithromycin is a new antibacterial agent of the ketolide class designed to provide optimal treatment against common bacterial respiratory tract pathogens. Telithromycin was derived by structural modification of the basic macrolide molecule to allow tight binding to the bacterial ribosome that enhances potency and minimizes the risk for the development of resistant strains.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of telithromycin 800 mg once daily with those of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), each for 10 days, in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at 54 centers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with acute CAP were randomized to receive 10-day treatment with oral telithromycin 800 mg once daily (administered as two 400-mg encapsulated tablets in the morning) and placebo (administered as 2 encapsulated tablets identical to the telithromycin in the evening) or high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg administered as two 250-mg identical encapsulated tablets twice daily). The primary outcome measure was clinical outcome at the posttherapy, test-of-cure visit (days 17–24 after the completion of therapy) in the clinically assessable per-protocol population. Secondary efficacy variables included bacteriologic outcome at the posttherapy, test-of-cure visit, and clinical and bacteriologic outcomes at the late posttherapy visit (day 31–45). Tolerability was assessed using investigator observation, patient self-reporting, clinical laboratory data, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and physical examination (including vital signs).

Results

A total of 493 patients were enrolled and 448 patients received ≥ 1 dose of study medication (224 patients/group). A diagnosis of CAP was confirmed in 416 patients (205 men, 211 women; median age, 43 years; telithromycin, n = 204; clarithromycin, n = 212). Clinical cure rates were 88.3% (143/162) in the telithromycin group and 88.5% (138/56) in the clarithromycin group. Bacterial eradication rates were comparable between treatment groups (telithromycin, (28/32) [87.5%]; clarithromycin, (29/30) [96.7%]. Both treatment were fairly well tolerated; adverse events were experienced in 57.0% of the patients treated with telithromycin and 49.1% of those treated with clarithromycin; most of these were assessed as mild.

Conclusions

In this study of adult patients with CAP, telithromycin 800 mg once daily was an effective and fairly well-tolerated regimen for initial empiric treatment, with clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and tolerability equivalent to therapy with high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily).

### Randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin versus IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin for treatment of patients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization [^5df6a098]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires the use of antibiotics with activity against a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens and suitable pharmacokinetic properties to simplify IV-to-oral step-down therapy switches.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin with a standard regimen of IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin in patients with mild to moderate CAP requiring hospitalization.

Methods

In a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study, adults with CAP received 7 to 14 days of treatment with either IV gatifloxacin 400 mg QD with the stepdown option or IV ceftriaxone 1 or 2 g QD (with or without erythromycin 0.5 or 1 g QID or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) with the stepdown option.

Results

One hundred seventy adults with CAP were included in the study. IV gatifloxacin was stepped down to oral gatifloxacin in 90.6% (7785) of patients; IV ceftriaxone was stepped down to oral clarithromycin in 87.1% (7485) of patients. Among clinically evaluable patients (n = 153), cure rates at 1 to 3 days after treatment were 97.4% in the gatifloxacin group (7476) and 90.9% in the ceftriaxone group (7077), with a 95% CI for the difference (-3.7% to 19.1%) indicating statistical equivalence. In patients in whom pathogens were isolated from pretreatment sputum cultures, bacteriologic eradication rates were 100.0% (2929) and 90.9% (3033), respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated; treatment-related adverse events occurred in 27.1% (2385) and 21.2% (1885) of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

In the population studied, treatment with IV gatifloxacin with an option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin was as effective for achieving clinical cure as IV ceftriaxone (with or without concomitant IV erythromycin or clarithromycin) with an option for oral stepdown clarithromycin. Both regimens were well tolerated.

### Respiratory tract infection and risk of bleeding in oral anticoagulant users: self-controlled case series [^172f0e93]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Most oral anticoagulants are initiated to prevent or treat venous thromboembolism, or to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. The main oral anticoagulants in use are warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. Recent trends suggest that warfarin use has decreased but use of direct oral anticoagulants has increased substantially, leading to an overall increase in oral anticoagulant use of 54% in the United States and 71% in the United Kingdom. In the highest prescribing regions of England in 2019, prescription rates of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants were 170 and 231 per 1000 residents, respectively. Although warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants can effectively prevent and treat thromboembolic events, they are also associated with morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding.

Drug-drug interactions between warfarin and certain antibiotics, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, are well known causes of serious bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants have fewer known drug-drug interactions than warfarin and have a more predictable anticoagulant response, resulting in fewer reports of antibiotic related harm. However, serious bleeding events are still reported, particularly after co-prescription of direct oral anticoagulants and macrolide antibiotics. For warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants, it is unclear whether bleeding arises primarily from antibiotic-anticoagulant interactions, or whether attributable risk is from the underlying infection itself. The relation between severe infection and coagulopathy is well recognisedbut little evidence currently supports an association between milder community acquired infections and bleeding.

### Effectiveness of oral moxifloxacin in standard first-line therapy in community-acquired pneumonia [^771eb96e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Based on recent guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, this study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new fluoroquinolone compared with standard antimicrobial regimens, in conditions relating as closely as possible to the real world setting. In this study, 564 patients were randomised to either oral moxifloxacin (400 mg o.d.) or to standard oral therapy (amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d. or clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. alone or in combination) for up to 14 days using a double-blind procedure. The choice between the three standard regimens was made by the clinician prior to randomisation. Clinical response, quality of life, symptoms, healthcare resources and safety were assessed. In the per-protocol population, clinical success was reported for 201 of 215 (93.5%) and 217 of 231 (93.9%) in the moxifloxacin and standard groups, respectively, at 7–10 days post-therapy. At 28–35 days follow-up, continued clinical cure was observed in 183 of 192 (95.3%) moxifloxacin and 207 of 221 (93.7%) standard groups. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 55 of 274 (20%) moxifloxacin and 86 of 279 (31%) standard patients with diarrhoea > 5%. Oral moxifloxacin monotherapy was as effective as, and better tolerated than, optimal antibiotic strategy represented either by mono- or combination therapy (amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin) in community-acquired pneumonia management.

### A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy comparative study of gatifloxacin with clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^0a1927a1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Eligible patients were randomised in this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy parallel-group study in a ratio of 1:1 to either gatifloxacin 400 mg once-daily for 5–14 days plus matching placebo, or clarithromycin 500 mg twice-daily for 5–14 days. The primary outcome measure was clinical response (clinical cure plus improvement) at the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints were clinical response at end of study, clinical cure at end of treatment and end of study, bacteriological response at end of treatment and end of study, and treatment duration. The overall clinical response was similar in the two treatment groups, with 92.2% of gatifloxacin-treated patients cured or improved at the end of treatment, compared with 93.1% of those receiving clarithromycin. Corresponding bacteriological response rates (eradication plus presumed eradication) were 96.7% and 87.5%, respectively. The study drugs were well-tolerated, with nausea (gatifloxacin) and bitter taste (clarithromycin) being the only treatment-related adverse events with a frequency of > 5%. No patients experienced phototoxicity, hepatic or renal dysfunction, tendonitis or crystalluria. Oral gatifloxacin 400 mg once-daily appeared to be a safe and effective alternative to clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Dabigatran etexilate — P-glycoprotein (P-gp) interactions include effects of inhibitors and inducers on exposure; the bioavailability of P-gp substrates like dabigatran may be raised or reduced through inhibition or induction, and P-gp inhibitors include amiodarone, verapamil, ketoconazole, quinidine, and clarithromycin, whereas inducers include rifampicin and St. John's wort. In formal interaction studies, a first dose of 600 mg amiodarone raised dabigatran AUC and Cmax by about 50% and 60%. With verapamil, giving an immediate-release dose 1 hour before 150 mg dabigatran etexilate increased Cmax and AUC by about 180% and 150%, these elevations were reduced to about 60% and 50% after repeated dosing and to about 90% and 70% with an extended-release formulation, and the interaction became negligible (increases of 10% in Cmax and 20% for AUC) if verapamil was taken > 2 h after dabigatran etexilate. Twice-daily 500 mg clarithromycin increased dabigatran AUC and Cmax by about 19% and 15%. The strong P-glycoprotein inhibitors quinidine and ketoconazole are contraindicated when taking dabigatran etexilate, and approved product information advises caution with strong P-gp inducers like rifampicin or St. John's wort. Drug interactions that change Cmax and AUC have not been correlated with clinical outcomes; very large increases (quinidine, systemic ketoconazole) are likely to raise bleeding risk, moderate increases (amiodarone, verapamil) may become important with old age or reduced renal clearance, and strong P-gp inducers like rifampicin have potential to decrease drug exposure and therefore reduce efficacy.

### Efficacy and safety of oral solithromycin versus oral moxifloxacin for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: a global, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial (SOLITAIRE-ORAL) [^140b28ce]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and treatment recommendations, each with specific limitations, vary globally. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a novel macrolide, with moxifloxacin for treatment of CABP.

Methods

We did this global, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial at 114 centres in North America, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with clinically and radiographically confirmed pneumonia of Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based central block randomisation procedure (block size of four), to receive either oral solithromycin (800 mg on day 1, 400 mg on days 2–5, placebo on days 6–7) or oral moxifloxacin (400 mg on days 1–7). Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, PORT risk class (II vs III or IV), and medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study sponsor, investigators, staff, and patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was early clinical response, defined as an improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum production, dyspnoea) with no worsening in any symptom at 72 h after the first dose of study drug, with a 10% non-inferiority margin. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT-01756339.

Findings

Between Jan 3, 2013, and Sept 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 860 patients to receive solithromycin (n = 426) or moxifloxacin (n = 434). Patients were followed up to days 28–35 after first dose. Solithromycin was non-inferior to moxifloxacin in achievement of early clinical response: 333 (78·2%) patients had an early clinical response in the solithromycin group versus 338 (77·9%) patients in the moxifloxacin group (difference 0·29, 95% CI -5·5 to 6·1). Both drugs had a similar safety profile. 43 (10%) of 155 treatment-emergent adverse events in the solithromycin group and 54 (13%) of 154 such events in the moxifloxacin group were deemed to be related to study drug. The most common adverse events, mostly of mild severity, were gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhoea (18 [4%] patients in the solithromycin group vs 28 [6%] patients in the moxifloxacin group), nausea (15 [4%] vs 17 [4%] patients) and vomiting (ten [2%] patients in each group); and nervous system disorders, including headache (19 [4%] vs 11 [3%] patients) and dizziness (nine [2%] vs seven [2%] patients).

Interpretation

Oral solithromycin was non-inferior to oral moxifloxacin for treatment of patients with CABP, showing the potential to restore macrolide monotherapy for this indication.

### Effect of azithromycin on anticoagulation-related outcomes in geriatric patients receiving warfarin [^c4a56ace]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is known to have multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Of the macrolide family, erythromycin and clarithromycin have been shown to interact with warfarin, leading to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). The incidence of overanticoagulation in patients prescribed azithromycin stabilized on a warfarin regimen is controversial.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess warfarin dosage adjustments and their effect on the INR after treatment with azithromycin. The secondary objective was to examine the occurrence of hemorrhage in patients taking warfarin who received azithromycin.

Methods

This retrospective review included 100 patients from the Western New York Veterans Affairs Healthcare System aged ≥ 65 years who received a prescription for azithromycin and warfarin between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009. The inclusion criteria consisted of a stable warfarin dose (2 INR values within 0.2 of the therapeutic range and the last INR determined ≤ 30 days before the introduction of azithromycin) and no medication changes in the 30 days before azithromycin therapy initiation. A repeated INR was determined 3 to 30 days after azithromycin therapy was initiated. Patients were excluded if they discontinued warfarin use, had a history of hemorrhage, or were taking antiplatelets, anti-inflammatory agents, or any other antibiotics.

Results

The impact on the INR was analyzed using a paired samples t test comparing INR values and warfarin doses before and after azithromycin exposure. There was a significant change in the INR between the 2 groups (before vs after azithromycin exposure, P < 0.001). This change was clinically significant given that the values before and after exposure to azithromycin lead to a decrease in warfarin from a mean weekly dose of 30 mg to 29.2 mg (P = 0.001). However, changes in the INR did not result in vitamin K administration or adverse bleeding events.

Conclusions

The addition of azithromycin to a stable warfarin regimen resulted in a significant change in the INR and warfarin dosage alteration without an increase in bleeding.

### Lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin [^06b1b94a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin

The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended.

Oral Anticoagulants

There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. INR and prothrombin times should be frequently monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins)

Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment.

Caution should be exercised when prescribing clarithromycin with statins. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g., fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided.

### A prospective, double-blind, multicenter study comparing clarithromycin extended-release with trovafloxacin in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^9359096c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) generally include use of a macrolide, a fluoroquinolone, or doxycycline, although there is some debate concerning the use of a fluoroquinolone.

Objective

The efficacy and tolerability of a new once-daily, extended-release (ER) formulation of clarithromycin were compared with those of a fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, in the treatment of patients with CAP.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial in which outpatients were randomized to receive 7 days of once-daily treatment with either clarithromycin ER (two 500-mg tablets) or trovafloxacin (200 mg). Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old with signs and symptoms of pneumonia, radiologic evidence of an acute infiltrate, and mild to moderate infection, as classified by the investigator.

Results

One hundred seventy-six patients were randomized to study treatment. They were primarily white (88%) and equally distributed between the sexes (52% female). Their mean (± SD) age was 47.5 ± 16.2 years. Results were similar between treatment groups in rates of clinical cure, microbiologic cure, bacteriologic eradication, and radiologic success at the test-of-cure visit (14–21 days posttreatment) for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Among clinically evaluable patients, clinical cure rates for clarithromycin ER and trovafloxacin were 87% (74/85) and 95% (63/66), respectively, and radiologic success rates were 95% (80/84) and 95% (63/66), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between groups. In clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients, overall bacteriologic eradication rates were 89% (85/95) for clarithromycin ER and 96% (64/67) for trovafloxacin, with no significant differences between groups. Both antibiotics demonstrated high eradication rates against target microorganisms. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of specific drug-related adverse events. The majority of drug-related adverse events (> 90%) were considered mild or moderate and resolved without the need for additional treatment.

Conclusions

Although the study was prematurely terminated, resulting in inadequate power to demonstrate equivalence, once-daily clarithromycin ER was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of ambulatory adult (age ≥ 18 years) outpatients with CAP.

### Omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin (omeclamox-pak) [^0b0a6248]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7.3 Pimozide

The coadministration of pimozide and OMECLAMOX-PAK may increase the pimozide plasma concentrations due to an interaction with the clarithromycin component of OMECLAMOX-PAK. Post-marketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with pimozide has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes). Two sudden deaths have been reported when clarithromycin was added to ongoing pimozide therapy. Pimozide is metabolized partly by CYP3A4. When clarithromycin and pimozide are administered together, inhibition of CYP3A4 by clarithromycin may lead to increased plasma exposure to pimozide. OMECLAMOX-PAK is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide [see Contraindications (4.2)].

7.4 Antiarrhythmics

Concurrent use of antiarrhythmic drugs and OMECLAMOX-PAK may potentiate the antiarrhythmic effects due to an interaction with the clarithromycin component of OMECLAMOX-PAK. There have been post-marketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have also been reported in post-marketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Monitor electrocardiograms for QTc prolongation during coadministration of OMECLAMOX-PAK with antiarrhythmic drugs. Serum concentrations of antiarrhythmics, including digoxin, should also be monitored.

7.5 Anticoagulants

The simultaneous administration of anticoagulants and OMECLAMOX-PAK may alter the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants due to an interaction with the omeprazole and clarithromycin components of OMECLAMOX-PAK. Monitor prothrombin time and INR in patients receiving OMECLAMOX-PAK and oral anticoagulants simultaneously.

There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including omeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.

Spontaneous reports in the post-marketing period suggest that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^e235eb66]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Avoid combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers (7.2, 7.3)
Anticoagulants: Avoid concomitant use (7.4)

7.1 General Inhibition and Induction Properties

Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2, and the P-gp and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporters. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of bleeding. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers decrease exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

7.2 Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant administration of XARELTO with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no precautions are necessary with concomitant administration with XARELTO as the change in exposure is unlikely to affect the bleeding risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with Renal Impairment

XARELTO should not be used in patients with CrCl 15 to < 80 mL/min who are receiving concomitant combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Drugs that Induce Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Anticoagulants and NSAIDs/Aspirin

Coadministration of enoxaparin, warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel and chronic NSAID use may increase the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Avoid concurrent use of XARELTO with other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk unless benefit outweighs risk. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed a reduction in COPD exacerbations with long-term macrolides, yet the use of macrolides has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in some database studies; in one trial the 1-year incidence of cardiovascular death was minimal (1 out of 558 patients who received a macrolide) when patients with a resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, a corrected QT (QTc) interval greater than 450 msec, or use of QT-prolonging/torsades-associated medications were excluded, suggesting that the risk is low if patients are properly selected for macrolide therapy. In addition, chronic use of macrolides may be associated with the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, so macrolides are initiated on a case-by-case basis after carefully weighing the benefits versus risks for each patient.

### Rivaroxaban [^28589028]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Avoid combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers (7.2, 7.3)
Anticoagulants: Avoid concomitant use (7.4)

7.1 General Inhibition and Induction Properties

Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2, and the P-gp and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporters. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of bleeding. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers decrease exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

7.2 Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant administration of rivaroxaban tablets with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no precautions are necessary with concomitant administration with rivaroxaban tablets as the change in exposure is unlikely to affect the bleeding risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with Renal Impairment

Rivaroxaban tablets should not be used in patients with CrCl 15 to < 80 mL/min who are receiving concomitant combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Drugs that Induce Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Avoid concomitant use of rivaroxaban tablets with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Anticoagulants and NSAIDs/Aspirin

Coadministration of enoxaparin, warfarin, aspirin clopidogrel and chronic NSAID use may increase the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Avoid concurrent use of rivaroxaban tablets with other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk unless benefit outweighs risk. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: relapse? Hospital infection? [^26872239]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease worldwide, and relapsing SARS is a major concern. We encountered a 60-year-old woman who was admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong on March 29, 2003, with a fever of 39°C, chills, cough, malaise, and sore throat for 2 days before admission. She had no history of travel within 2 weeks of admission. She also had no close contact with patients who had a diagnosis of suspected or confirmed SARS. Chest radiograph on admission indicated consolidation over the right middle zone. In accordance with the diagnostic criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), this patient's condition was diagnosed as SARS in view of her symptoms, temperature, and chest radiograph findings (1).

Standard microbiologic investigations to exclude common respiratory virus and bacterium for community-acquired pneumonia, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were negative in our patient. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was negative for coronavirus twice. The coronavirus antibody titer was less than 1/25. The patient was initially treated with oral clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) and intravenous amoxycillin-clavulanate combination (1.2 g three times a day). Despite the negative evidence for coronavirus infection, she was treated with intravenous ribavirin (24 mg/kg once a day) and hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg once a day) after 48 hours of antibiotics therapy (2). The patient's symptoms were relieved, and she remained afebrile 3 days after admission. Tolerance for medication was good except for a moderate degree of hemolytic anemia (her hemoglobin level dropped to 9.1 g/dL) and hypokalemia that developed during treatment. On day 15, the chest radiography was clear. The patient was discharged after 3 weeks of hospital stay.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^dcd15bca]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

Drug Interaction Studies

Effect of Lansoprazole on Other Drugs

Cytochrome P450 Interactions

Lansoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes. Studies have shown that lansoprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, such as warfarin, antipyrine, indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin, propranolol, prednisone, diazepam, or clarithromycin in healthy subjects. These compounds are metabolized through various cytochrome P450 isozymes including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.

Theophylline

When lansoprazole was administered concomitantly with theophylline (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen. Because of the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on theophylline clearance, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical concern (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate

In an open-label, single-arm, eight day, pharmacokinetic study of 28 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (who required the chronic use of 7.5 to 15 mg of methotrexate given weekly), administration of seven days of naproxen 500 mg twice daily and lansoprazole 30 mg daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate. While this study was not designed to assess the safety of this combination of drugs, no major adverse reactions were noted. However, this study was conducted with low doses of methotrexate. A drug interaction study with high doses of methotrexate has not been conducted (see WARNINGS).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and stewardship considerations: Duration for most patients is 5–7 days; patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics, and a longer duration is required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended, because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII). Patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AI).

### Anemia in older adults… [^0f5cf02e]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

3, 4 Most of these patients have mild anemia, but even mild anemia is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 15, 16 Therefore, obtaining a serum ferritin level is the first step when evaluating these patients. 15–19 A level less than 19 ng per mL is highly suggestive of iron deficiency anemia, but this condition can be present in patients with higher levels. 17 Iron deficiency anemia is less likely in patients with serum ferritin levels of 46 to 100 ng per mL, although it cannot be ruled out. In these patients, the serum transferrin receptor–ferritin index can be used to distinguish between iron deficiency anemia and other types.

If iron deficiency anemia is excluded, anemia of chronic disease is the most likely cause of microcytic or normocytic anemia. In older patients, anemia of chronic disease is most often caused by CKD, which can be assessed with serum creatinine and the glomerular filtration rate. Further evaluation based on clinical presentation is necessary for patients in whom iron deficiency anemia and CKD have been excluded. Evaluation should begin with a peripheral blood smear and reticulocyte count, with further evaluation based on results of these tests. 24 Treatment and Referral Treatment of anemia is ultimately guided by the underlying diagnosis. This article focuses on treatment in the outpatient setting for the most common etiologies in older patients. Hospital admission and blood transfusion should be considered if there is concern for significant anemia or if the patient is symptomatic.

Parenteral iron may also be appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron because of gastrointestinal adverse effects, and in those with ongoing blood loss that exceeds the ability to replace iron via oral administration. Infusion strategies vary by product, but all are equally safe and effective. 31, 32 Adverse effects with parenteral iron are rare but include allergic reactions, hypotension, dyspnea, abdominal pain, chest pain, back pain, nausea, and vomiting.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^b6ba0da0]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

A woman in her mid-70s was referred to the emergency department with worsening dyspnoea, persistent dry cough and asthenia. Her general practitioner suspected pneumonia and started antibiotic therapy with co-amoxicillin 1 g three times a day for a total of 7 days, which ended 4 days before admission. Medical history was relevant for ischaemic heart disease with two coronary stents, atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with rivaroxaban and bilateral breast implants inserted 50 years ago. The last prosthetic replacement was 20 years ago, and both breast implants have definitively been removed 1 year ago following invasive carcinoma of the right breast, now considered to be in remission. She also has Poland syndrome, a rare congenital malformation consisting of partial or complete agenesis of the pectoralis major muscle and of the breast resulting in pectus excavatum for which she had undergone multiple interventions and reconstruction with a silicone implant 50 years ago (figures1 2).

Figure 1
Patient's first CT showing multiple bilateral peripheral condensations.

Figure 2
Patient's second CT, 7 days later, showing an increase in the extent of bilateral peripheral pulmonary condensations, with the appearance of adjacent ground-glass areas.

On evaluation, the patient was irregularly tachycardic at 102 beats per minute with normal blood pressure and afebrile. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Pulmonary auscultation revealed coarse rales up to the right mid-pulmonary fold. Blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (108 mg/L), normal white cell count and negative procalcitonin (0.06 ug/L). A chest CT scan (figure 1) showed multiple bilateral peripheral condensations, predominantly on the right, suggestive of pneumonia and a pre-sternal silicone implant. Ceftriaxone 2 g once daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily were started, and the patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward.

The clinical course was unfavourable with the development of hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen (2 L/min) and fever, as well as the persistence of the inflammatory syndrome. Antibiotic therapy was switched to piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g three times a day.

### Rabeprazole sodium (Aciphex) [^a9ffd4fc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with ACIPHEX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI.

5.2 Interaction with Warfarin

Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients. There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.3 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions, to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia).

Discontinue ACIPHEX and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindication (4)].

5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ACIPHEX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with ACIPHEX, refer to Warnings and Precautions sections of the corresponding prescribing information.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Vonoprazan fumarate and amoxicillin (Voquezna DUAL PAK) [^becdb945]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins)

Concomitant use of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK with lovastatin or simvastatin may increase these drug's plasma concentrations due to the clarithromycin component, which may increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with clarithromycin (a component of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK) and lovastatin or simvastatin. Concomitant use of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. If treatment with VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. Exercise caution when prescribing VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK with atorvastatin or pravastatin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin

Concomitant use of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK, and hypoglycemic agents (such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide, or rosiglitazone) and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia due to the clarithromycin component. Carefully monitor glucose levels when these drugs are used concomitantly with VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Quetiapine

Concomitant use of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK with quetiapine could result in somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation due to the clarithromycin component. Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommended dosage reduction if co-administered with VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Warfarin

There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in the international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time when clarithromycin (a component of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK) is used concomitantly with warfarin. Monitor INR and prothrombin times frequently when warfarin is used concomitantly with VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK.

Benzodiazepines

Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration when clarithromycin (a component of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK), and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam and midazolam. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged central nervous system effects when benzodiazepines such astriazolam or midazolam are used concomitantly with VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Lomitapide mesylate (Juxtapid) [^e254e611]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lomitapide mesylate PO (also known as Juxtapid):
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking warfarin. Monitor INR levels and adjust warfarin dose accordingly.
- **Fat malabsorption**: use caution in all patients, especially with chronic bowel or pancreatic diseases. Initiate daily supplementation of vitamin E, linoleic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids.
- **Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lomitapide has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

### Omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin (omeclamox-pak) [^7a906f8b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Administration

Inform patients that each dose of OMECLAMOX-PAK contains four pills: one opaque lavender/grey capsule (omeprazole), one white tablet (clarithromycin) and two opaque yellow capsules (amoxicillin).

Take each dose of four pills in the morning and four pills in the evening before eating a meal, for 10 days. Capsules and tablets should not be crushed or chewed, and should be swallowed whole [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Advise females of reproductive potential that that if pregnancy occurs while taking this OMECLAMOX-PAK, there is a potential hazard to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Drug Interactions

Patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications while taking OMECLAMOX-PAK [see Drug Interactions (7)].

The simultaneous administration of any of the following drugs with OMECLAMOX-PAK may result in clinically significant adverse reactions or even death:

Colchicine
Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine
Pimozide

Diarrhea

Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by omeprazole and antibiotics that usually ends when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment, patients can develop severe diarrhea with watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the drug. If this occurs, patients should contact a physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Advise the patient or caregiver to call the patient's healthcare provider immediately if they experience signs and/or symptoms associated with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^b2bd5f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^6f36bcbb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Setting and design

This prospective, single-center, open-label, quasi-randomized study was conducted from June 3, 2002 to June 30, 2008 at Ono Municipal Hospital (Ono, Hyogo, Japan). The institutional review board of Ono Municipal Hospital approved the study protocol, and written, informed consent was obtained from all patients. If patient was under 20 years, the consent of his/her parent was also obtained. Patients were enrolled and allocated by attending doctor. Treatment allocation was performed based on the day of month on which the patient was admitted to hospital. If the day of month of admission was an odd number, patients were treated using intravenous CTRX at 2 g every 24 h. If the day of month of admission was an even number, patients were treated using intravenous ABPC/SBT at 3 g every 12 h. These dosages were determined based on drug information available in Japan at the launch of the study. The dose of CTRX or ABPC/SBT was adjusted as follows based on the creatinine clearance rate (CCr): CCr 10–50 mL/min, CTRX 1 g every 24 h or ABPC/SBT 3 g every 12 h; and CCr < 10 mL/min, CTRX 1 g every 24 h or ABPC/SBT 1.5 g every 24 h. In patients with mild to moderate pneumonia (PSI I–IV), clarithromycin 200 mg was given orally every 12 h in addition to CTRX or ABPC/SBT. This dosage was determined because only clarithromycin 200 mg tablets could be used in Japan and this dosage was approved dose at the time of study. In patients with severe pneumonia (PSI V), erythromycin 500 mg was given intravenously every 6 h in addition to CTRX or ABPC/SBT. No other antibiotics were allowed. The patients received antibiotic treatment for 7–14 days, until their body temperature was < 37 °C for 48 h with clinical stability, and improvements were seen in terms of dyspnea, sputum, or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. When a patient showed a recurrence of fever > 37.5 °C after initial improvement of fever, the same antibiotic therapy was continued for 4 days from the first day of recurrence.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^2046e0a7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^17607950]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

P-gp inhibitors, inducers and substrates

Net absorption of DOACs is dependent on the intestinal permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter. Strong P-gp inducers, such as rifampin, older antiepileptics (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital), and St John's wort, decrease exposure to DOACs and concurrent use should be avoided due to increased risk of thrombosis. Strong P-gp inhibitors such as amiodarone, verapamil, clarithromycin, dronedarone and antifungals (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole) increase the absorption, exposure and bioavailability of DOACs, potentially leading to increased bleeding complications. P-gp inhibitors increase dabigatran bioavailability by ~10% to 20%. There are also case reports of major bleeding in elderly patients taking concomitant dabigatran with P-gp inhibitors that might have been due in part to the inhibition of P-gp, in addition to other factors such as age and decreased renal function (Table 1). More recently, in a retrospective cohort study of AF patients on dabigatran, concomitant use of digoxin, which is a substrate of P-gp, was associated with 33% increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 1).

CYP450 inducers and inhibitors

Dabigatran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of hepatic CYPs. As less than 4% of the active metabolite of edoxaban is metabolised by CYP3A4, drug interactions with CYP inducers or inhibitors are not expected. However, rivaroxaban and apixaban are CYP3A4 substrates; co-administration with drugs that inhibit or induce this metabolic enzyme as well as P-gp (e.g. ketoconazole or rifampicin) could significantly affect drug response, leading to increased risk of bleeding or reduced efficacy, respectively.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^042a3e58]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and adolescents with HIV — empiric regimens and dosing: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII); providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g. PCP, TB), which may alter empiric therapy. Empiric outpatient therapy includes a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII), with preferred beta-lactams high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate; alternatives are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII) or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is listed, with preferred beta-lactams ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; options for penicillin-allergic patients are levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AI) or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI). Alternative therapy options include a PO beta-lactam plus PO doxycycline (CIII), an IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (CIII), and for penicillin-allergic patients with severe CAP, aztreonam IV plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (BIII).

### Interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban exposure: contribution of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms and interaction with clarithromycin [^6243eba5]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the ABCB1 gene. We tested the effect of ABCB1 polymorphisms and of a P-gp inhibitor on both drugs' pharmacokinetics. The ABCB1 genotype was not a clinically relevant determinant of both drugs' pharmacokinetics. Administration of P-gp inhibitors with dabigatran or rivaroxaban should be exercised with caution.

Summary

Background The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran and rivaroxaban are both substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by cytochrome P450 A4 (CYP3A4). Interindividual variability in DOAC exposure and frequent P-gp-associated drug-drug interactions have been described in patients. Objective To assess the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, associated or not with clarithromycin, a P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Methods Sixty healthy male volunteers, selected according to ABCB1 genotype (20 homozygous mutated, 20 heterozygous mutated, and 20 wild-type for haplotype 2677–3435), were included in this randomized, two-center, crossover study. All received sequentially a single dose of dabigatran etexilate (300 mg) and rivaroxaban (40 mg) associated or not with clarithromycin. Peak plasma concentration and area under the curve (AUC) were compared across the three ABCB1 genotypes. The effect of clarithromycin on dabigatran or rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics was assessed. Results Interindividual coefficients of variation for AUC were 77% for dabigatran and 51% for rivaroxaban. ABCB1 genotype did not significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics: AUC ratios between mutant-allele carriers and wild-type volunteers were 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–1.92) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96–1.51) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively. Clarithromycin coadministration led to a two-fold increase in both drugs' AUC, irrespective of ABCB1 genotype: ratios of geometric means were 2.0 (95% CI 1.15–3.60) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.42–2.63) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively. Conclusions ABCB1 genotype is not a significant determinant of interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The levels of one drug did not predict the levels of the other. Coadministration of a P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor with dabigatran or rivaroxaban may warrant caution in patients at risk of overexposure.

### Azithromycin [^def1fc02]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Nelfinavir: Close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. (7.1)
Warfarin: Use with azithromycin may increase coagulation times; monitor prothrombin time. (7.2)

7.1 Nelfinavir

Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted [see Adverse Reactions (6)]

7.2 Warfarin

Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.

7.3 Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides

Interactions with digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.

### Respiratory tract infection and risk of bleeding in oral anticoagulant users: self-controlled case series [^86413c3d]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

We repeated the analyses with all RTIs, irrespective of whether patients received immediate antibiotic treatment, and included 1258 RTIs for major bleeding (770 (61%) treated) and 3482 RTIs for CRNMB (2154 (62%) treated). For those participants receiving immediate antibiotics, the most common were amoxicillin (67%), doxycycline (15%), and clarithromycin (8%). We observed a small reduction in the magnitude of the relative incidence of major bleeding (incidence rate ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.74 to 3.00) and CRNMB (2.17, 1.85 to 2.54), compared with our main analysis (table 3). We found no evidence of effect modification by sex (eTable 6) or by type of anticoagulant used (table 4). No significant associations were observed between eye and external ear infections and major bleeding or CRNMB (major bleeding 0.74, 0.30 to 1.83; CRNMB 1.26, 0.84 to 1.89; eTable 7). We identified a Read code suggestive of warfarin monitoring or dose change within the 14 day risk period after 88 (26%) RTIs in people who had a major bleed, and 301 (23%) RTIs in those people who had a CRNMB. Few RTIs were associated with an NSAID prescription on the day of consultation (n = 0 in people with a major bleed, n = 3 in those with a CRNMB) or at any time in the 90 days before the consultation (n = 24, n = 37) suggesting that prescribed NSAID use was not likely to be an important temporal confounder.

### Lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin (Prevpac) [^980db7a3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Warfarin

In a study of healthy subjects, neither the pharmacokinetics of warfarin enantiomers nor prothrombin time were affected following single or multiple 60 mg doses of lansoprazole. However, there have been reports of increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including PREVACID, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.

Sucralfate

In a single-dose crossover study examining PREVACID 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the proton pump inhibitors was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with sucralfate. Therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sucralfate. In clinical trials, antacids were administered concomitantly with PREVACID and there was no evidence of a change in the efficacy of PREVACID.

Amoxicillin

Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.

Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.

### Betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate [^317aa58c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

​ Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.

Anticholinesterases

Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

Anticoagulants, Oral

Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.

Antidiabetics

Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.

Antitubercular Drugs

Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.

Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.

Cyclosporine

Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.

Digitalis Glycosides

Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.

Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives

Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.

Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin)

Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.

Interactions with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Corticosteroids (including betamethasone) are metabolized by CYP3A4.

Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.

Coadministration with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products) may lead to increased exposures of corticosteroids and therefore the potential for increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.

Consider the benefit of coadministration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS)

Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.

The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Endpoints/outcomes

On Day 4, counted from the first day of dosing, patients in the MITT population of both treatment groups were assessed for early clinical response (ECR) and categorized as favourable, unfavourable, or indeterminate. The historical evidence for the benefit of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of CABP is based on CABP symptoms, evaluated after 3–5 days of therapy, irrespective of the duration of therapy. Therefore, an evidence-based non-inferiority margin for a symptom-based clinical endpoint could only be justified for the early clinical response (assessed on Day 4 in this study). A favourable ECR (programmatically determined; computer algorithm, written to match the protocol definition) was defined as alive and at least 1 level improvement (e.g. severe to moderate, moderate to mild, mild to absent) in at least 2 CABP symptoms (dyspnea, cough, production of purulent sputum or pleuritic chest pain) compared with the baseline visit and without worsening in any other CABP symptoms. The severity of symptoms were assessed by a 4-point scale by the investigator based on the CABP Symptom Severity Guidance for Investigator Assessment (Appendix III of study protocol, Supplement 1). Unfavourable response was defined as no improvement in at least 2 CABP symptoms compared with that at baseline, or worsening in any of the CABP symptoms compared with that at baseline, or death from any cause at or before Day 4. Patients with missing data or those lost to follow-up (FU) were classified as having an indeterminate response. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the MITT population in each treatment group, who demonstrated a favourable ECR on Day 4. Patients with an indeterminate response were included in the denominator and considered as having an unfavourable response for this calculation; thus, no patients were excluded from the analysis. Study endpoints were in accordance to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) CABP guidance and accepted by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).

### Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics versus placebo for any indication [^4a5a6c09]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment-specific, rather than disease-specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases.

Objectives

To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide-resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta-analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event.

Main Results

We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low-quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low-quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate-quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate-quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate-quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low-quality evidence). Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low-quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low-quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low-quality evidence) compared to placebo. We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate-quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non-significant. There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low-quality evidence). Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as "none were observed". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^425b58ed]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS Proton pump inhibitors should be started upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. 33 Initiation of a proton pump inhibitor should not be delayed before endoscopy. Oral proton pump inhibitors may be preferred over intravenous ones because of cost savings when used in conjunction with endoscopic treatment. 34 A 2017 meta-analysis of nine RCTs showed no difference between oral and intravenous proton pump inhibitors in recurrent bleeding, surgery, or mortality. Rebleeding and Follow-up Strategies REBLEEDING WHEN TO RESTART ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY Deciding when to restart antithrombotic therapy after upper GI bleeding is difficult because of a lack of sufficient data. A 2018 meta-analysis of seven observational studies including 5, 685 individuals who had atrial fibrillation showed the resumption of anticoagulant therapy after GI bleeding vs. not restarting therapy was associated with a 10.

8% absolute risk reduction for all-cause mortality. 36 Guidelines recommend warfarin be resumed seven to 15 days after a bleeding event. 5, 13 Resumption of warfarin should be considered within seven days for patients at a higher thromboembolic risk. 5 Patients who experience GI bleeding on a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant should be switched to apixaban. 13 If bleeding occurs while taking apixaban 5 mg, dose reduction is recommended.
13. Guidelines recommend resumption of aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease immediately following endoscopy if the rebleeding risk is low or within three days if the rebleeding risk is moderate or high. 5 One RCT of 156 individuals analyzed immediate reintroduction of aspirin with proton pump inhibitors post-endoscopy and found that patients who did not resume aspirin had an increase in all-cause mortality at eight weeks.

3 When to resume dual antiplatelet therapy is challenging because these patients often have acute coronary syndrome or recent coronary stent placement. In individuals requiring dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin should be resumed first after hemostasis is reestablished because of reduced bleeding risk compared with clopidogrel. 37 Early resumption of clopidogrel within five to seven days should be considered in high-risk patients. 37.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^05a30fda]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Warfarin drug interactions and bleeding risk — drugs such as aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, high-dose penicillins, and moxalactam increase the risk of warfarin-associated bleeding by inhibiting platelet function, and aspirin is the most important because of its widespread use and prolonged effect; aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can also produce gastric erosions that increase the risk of upper GI bleeding, which can occur even with COX-2 inhibitors. In one case-control analysis of 98,821 subjects on warfarin, celecoxib and rofecoxib were associated with a 1.7- or 2.4-fold increased risk of GI hemorrhage, respectively, and the risk of clinically important bleeding is heightened when high doses of aspirin are taken during high-intensity warfarin therapy (INR, 3.0–4.5). However, low doses of aspirin (ie, 75 to 100 mg daily) combined with moderate-intensity and low-intensity warfarin anticoagulation therapy are also associated with increased rates of bleeding; the effect of statins or fibrates on bleeding in patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is controversial, with initiation of a fibrate or a statin that inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes reported to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin-treated patients, whereas other statins mainly excreted unchanged were not, and other authors reported that long-term statin use is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding complications in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on warfarin therapy.

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

Antibiotics

Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.

Anticholinesterases

Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

Anticoagulants, Oral

Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.

Antidiabetics

Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.

Antitubercular Drugs

Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.

Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.

Cyclosporine

Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.

Digitalis Glycosides

Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.

Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives

Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.

Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin)

Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.

Interactions with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Corticosteroids (including betamethasone) are metabolized by CYP3A4.

Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.

Coadministration with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products) may lead to increased exposures of corticosteroids and therefore the potential for increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.

Consider the benefit of coadministration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS)

Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^c4d979fb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Reports on clinical outcome of the pharmacokinetic interactions with DOACs are inconsistent. In a meta‐analysis of 32,465 patients from randomized controlled trials of patients with AF, P‐gp/CYP3A4‐modulating drugs use was correlated with increased risk of major bleeding among rivaroxaban users, when compared with warfarin (Risk ratio, 1.37, 1.01–1.85). Several real‐world studies have supported the association between P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors use and bleeding risk in patients treated with DOACs, whereas others did not.

In a retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database, that included 91,330 patients with AF, it was concluded that use of the inhibitors: amiodarone, fluconazole, but also, surprisingly, of the inducers rifampin and phenytoin, were associated with significant increased incidence rates of major bleeding. Moreover, incidence rate for major bleeding was lower and not higher for use of erythromycin or clarithromycin, known to be moderate‐strong P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors; and was not higher with some known P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, it should be noted that the annual bleeding rate in the Taiwanese studywas threefold higher than annual serious bleeding event rates reported previously in anticoagulated patients with AF. As emergency department visits without hospitalizations comprised the outcome along with inpatient diagnoses, it might have been that less serious bleeding events were included. In addition, the patient‐quarters method used precluded the ability for a new‐user analysis; covariates assessed on the first day of each patient quarter might have been influenced by DOAC exposure. For example, anemia, adjusted for in each new quarter, might have been already the early sign of the outcome associated with the DOAC, and adjusting for this intermediate variable is susceptible to bias.

Rivaroxaban — drug–drug interactions and coadministration with aspirin, naproxen, and pH-altering agents — show that erythromycin 500 mg three times daily causes a 1.3-fold increase in both the AUC and the Cmax, whereas strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin cause a 50% decrease in the AUC, and substrates of either CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (atorvastatin, digoxin, midazolam) did not result in clinically relevant interactions. In a randomized, two-way crossover study in healthy men aged between 18 and 55 years, participants received aspirin 500 mg on the first day and 100 mg on the second day, rivaroxaban 15 mg, or the combination at the same dosages; inhibition of platelet aggregation with aspirin was 89.3% greater than with rivaroxaban alone, and with aspirin plus rivaroxaban it was 97.4% greater than with rivaroxaban alone, and bleeding time was prolonged to 1.46 times the baseline by aspirin alone and to 1.96 times the baseline by adding aspirin to rivaroxaban. In a randomized two-way crossover study in healthy men aged between 18 and 45 years, 15 mg of rivaroxaban alone vs 15 mg plus naproxen 500 mg showed bleeding time was significantly increased by the combined use, with plasma concentrations slightly increased by 10% for both the AUC and the Cmax after coadministration of naproxen; drugs that alter gastric pH such as ranitidine or aluminum-magnesium hydroxide had no effect on plasma concentrations or pharmacodynamics.

### Macrolides for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults: who should receive this treatment? [^b3908ae4]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term macrolide therapy offers an evidence-based treatment to reduce frequent exacerbations in stable adult patients with bronchiectasis. There is limited evidence that these agents also attenuate the decline in lung function and improve health-related quality of life. The benefits and risks of long-term macrolide use need to be clearly explored for individual patients. Further work is needed to understand the optimal drug, dose, and regimen, the mechanisms behind these benefits, appropriate patient selection, sustainability of efficacy, potential long-term risk for the lung microbiome; and their use with or without inhaled antibiotic treatment. We reviewed the current evidence on long-term macrolides in adults with bronchiectasis.

### Proton-pump inhibitors and long-term risk of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults [^32611e0a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 40% of elderly adults receive PPIs, and appropriate clinical indications may be lacking for up to 85% of PPIs prescribed. 22, 23 Pneumonia is a major cause of death, 24, 25 costing in excess of $17 billion per year in the United States alone. 26 It is therefore important to clarify associations between PPIs and pneumonia for short‐ and long‐term exposure, especially in older adults, who may be most at risk from lack of barriers to respiratory infection. We therefore aimed to estimate long‐term associations between PPI prescription and risk of pneumonia in individuals in primary care aged 60 and older, similarly applying the PERR approach to account for prior differences between PPI‐treated individuals and controls.

### Clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of telithromycin in patients with bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia [^050abe30]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This retrospective analysis was performed to determine the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of the ketolide antibacterial telithromycin in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with pneumococcal bacteremia. Patients 13 years old with radiologically confirmed CAP and a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae at screening were analyzed from eight multicenter Phase III/IV clinical trials. In four open-label, non-comparative studies, patients received telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days. In four randomized, controlled, double-blind, comparative studies, patients received telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 5–10 days or a comparator antimicrobial (amoxicillin 1000 mg three times daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, or trovafloxacin 200 mg once daily) for 7–10 days. In total, 118 patients (telithromycin, 94/1061 [8.9%]; comparator, 24/244 [9.8%]) had documented pneumococcal bacteremia. Those who were treated with telithromycin achieved a clinical cure rate of 90.2% (74/82, per-protocol population); S. pneumoniae was eradicated in 77/82 (93.9%) bacteremic patients who received telithromycin and 15/19 (78.9%) comparator-treated patients. Clinical cure was also observed among telithromycin-treated bacteremic patients who were infected with penicillin- or erythromycin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae (5/7 and 8/10, respectively). In conclusion, telithromycin achieves high clinical and bacteriologic cure rates in CAP patients with pneumococcal bacteremia.
