## Question

Does cymbalta help with anxiety

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Cymbalta (duloxetine) helps with anxiety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about approved indications. Then, I should verify the randomized controlled trial evidence for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. Next, I will examine pediatric data and geriatric considerations. After that, I need to check comparative effectiveness versus other treatments. I should also review onset of action, functional outcomes, and safety/tolerability, including discontinuation and boxed warnings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer with dosing guidance and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because that anchors the clinical claim. The FDA labeling indicates Cymbalta is indicated for generalized anxiety disorder in adults and in pediatric patients aged 7 years and older, which directly supports its use for anxiety within the GAD diagnostic category [^1162zhQY] [^113MguFv].

> Wait, let me verify the adult efficacy trials before drawing conclusions. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with DSM-IV GAD (GAD-1, GAD-2, GAD-3) showed duloxetine was superior to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and improved functional impairment on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), with doses typically ranging from 60 to 120 mg/day; importantly, while 120 mg/day was effective, there was no evidence that doses above 60 mg/day conferred additional benefit, so 60 mg/day is generally the target dose for most adults [^111MtfyU] [^1166UYqP] [^111FUH4p].

> Hold on, I should verify maintenance data to ensure durability of effect. In a 26-week relapse-prevention study (GAD-4), patients who responded to open-label duloxetine and were then randomized to continue duloxetine had a significantly longer time to relapse than those switched to placebo, supporting maintenance efficacy in GAD [^111MtfyU] [^112AumvD].

> Next, I should review pediatric data because the user might be asking about youth. A 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents aged 7–17 years (GAD-6) demonstrated superiority of duloxetine over placebo on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), establishing efficacy for pediatric GAD; the USPSTF also notes duloxetine as the only medication with an FDA indication for any anxiety disorder in children 7 years and older, which is clinically relevant when considering pharmacotherapy for pediatric anxiety [^114bcLdw] [^113i7mDZ] [^1112jvtx].

> I need to check geriatric considerations separately, since tolerability and dosing can differ. In adults aged 65 years and older, a dedicated 10-week trial (GAD-5) showed duloxetine was superior to placebo on HAM-A, with a mean endpoint dose around 51 mg/day; subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in outcomes by age, supporting efficacy in older adults with appropriate monitoring [^113c8Go2] [^111V2EDX].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness, because patients often ask how duloxetine stacks up. A large network meta-analysis of 89 trials found duloxetine had a significant effect versus placebo on HAM-A (mean difference about −3.13) and ranked among effective options with relatively good acceptability; a head-to-head non-inferiority study also showed duloxetine 60–120 mg/day was non-inferior to venlafaxine XR 75–225 mg/day for GAD, with similar response rates around 56–58% [^116gFJxg] [^113iCTmR].

> But wait, what about onset and functional outcomes — do patients feel better quickly and does that translate to daily life? Pooled analyses suggest early improvement on HAM-A by week 2 predicts endpoint response and remission, and duloxetine improved role functioning and quality of life across work, social, and family domains versus placebo; additionally, in patients with co-occurring pain symptoms, duloxetine reduced both anxiety and pain severity, which can be clinically meaningful in GAD with somatic complaints [^115Butpj] [^117Lu1ja] [^113VBLEo].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability, because that often drives adherence. Common adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, constipation, and hyperhidrosis; discontinuation due to adverse events is higher in GAD trials than in MDD trials (about 13.7% vs 8.4%), with nausea and dizziness the most frequent reasons, so slow titration and counseling can mitigate early tolerability issues [^115eiPRF] [^116FAGxE] [^114QPDpn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping the medicine. Duloxetine can cause discontinuation symptoms if stopped abruptly, including dizziness, headache, nausea, paresthesia, irritability, insomnia, and anxiety; a gradual taper over at least 1–2 weeks is recommended whenever possible, with slower tapers if symptoms emerge [^116yjmvj].

> I need to ensure boxed warnings and monitoring are addressed. Like other antidepressants, duloxetine carries a boxed warning for increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults; close monitoring for clinical worsening, suicidality, and behavioral changes is essential, especially during initiation and dose changes, and families should be engaged in observation and communication with the prescriber [^112mWMHe] [^116mzqJY].

> Let me think about practical dosing, and I should confirm the labeled guidance. For most adults with GAD, start at 60 mg once daily or 30 mg once daily for 1 week to improve tolerability, then increase to 60 mg; doses above 60 mg can be considered, but there is no consistent evidence of added benefit and higher doses increase adverse effects, so 60 mg is typically the therapeutic target. In patients 65 years and older, starting at 30 mg for 1–2 weeks before increasing is prudent. In pediatric patients 7–17 years, start at 30 mg for 2 weeks, then titrate based on response and tolerability up to 60–120 mg/day, with a mean endpoint dose around 57.6 mg in trials [^11575NTm] [^113c8Go2] [^113i7mDZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does duloxetine help with anxiety symptoms in depression as well, or only GAD? Pooled analyses in major depressive disorder show duloxetine improves anxiety/somatization subfactors and performs comparably in anxious versus non-anxious depressed subgroups, supporting anxiolytic benefit beyond GAD, though the formal indication for anxiety remains GAD [^112ea1cp] [^116WLMDU].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, Cymbalta (duloxetine) helps with anxiety, specifically generalized anxiety disorder, with robust FDA-approved indications in adults and pediatric patients aged 7 years and older, supported by multiple randomized trials demonstrating superiority to placebo on anxiety severity and functional outcomes, maintenance of effect in relapse-prevention designs, and comparable efficacy to venlafaxine XR; clinically meaningful improvement often begins within 1–2 weeks, though full response may take 4–6 weeks, and careful attention to tolerability, discontinuation practices, and boxed-warning monitoring is essential for safe and effective use [^1162zhQY] [^111MtfyU] [^116gFJxg] [^115Butpj] [^112mWMHe].

---

Cymbalta (duloxetine) is **FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** [^1162zhQY] in adults and children aged 7–17 years [^114bcLdw], with **efficacy demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials** [^111MtfyU] showing significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and improved functioning versus placebo [^111MtfyU]. It is **not FDA-approved for other anxiety disorders** (e.g. panic, social anxiety) [^1162zhQY], though some clinicians use it off-label; evidence is limited and mixed [^notfound]. Typical dosing starts at 30 mg/day for 1 week, then 60 mg/day; higher doses (up to 120 mg/day) may be used if needed, but doses above 60 mg/day do not consistently add benefit [^11575NTm] [^1166UYqP]. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and dry mouth [^114q8zWq]; monitor for suicidal ideation, especially in younger patients [^112mWMHe], and taper slowly to avoid discontinuation symptoms [^116yjmvj].

---

## Indications and approvals

Cymbalta is **FDA-approved** for the following anxiety-related indications:

- **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**: Adults and pediatric patients aged 7 years and older [^1162zhQY] [^114bcLdw].
- **Major depressive disorder (MDD)**: Often co-occurring with anxiety symptoms [^116WLMDU].

Cymbalta is **not FDA-approved** for other anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobias, though it may be prescribed off-label in some cases [^1162zhQY].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in anxiety disorders

### Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that Cymbalta significantly reduces anxiety symptoms and improves functioning in GAD compared with placebo [^111MtfyU] [^116gFJxg]. In a **maintenance study**, patients continuing Cymbalta had a significantly longer time to relapse than those switched to placebo, supporting its effectiveness in maintaining symptom control [^111MtfyU] [^112AumvD].

---

### Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents aged 7–17 years demonstrated that Cymbalta significantly reduced anxiety symptoms compared with placebo, as measured by the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) [^114bcLdw] [^115DZ9Hi].

---

### Anxiety symptoms associated with depression

Cymbalta has also been shown to effectively reduce anxiety symptoms commonly associated with major depressive disorder, providing dual benefits for patients experiencing both conditions [^116WLMDU].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to anxiety

Cymbalta is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain — neurotransmitters implicated in mood and anxiety regulation. This dual action is believed to underlie its **anxiolytic effects** [^111caQf2] [^116hCGbH].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

For generalized anxiety disorder, the **recommended dosage** is:

| **Patient population** | **Initial dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adults | 30 mg once daily for 1 week | 60 mg once daily | 120 mg once daily (if needed) |
| Pediatric patients (7–17 years) | 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks | 30–60 mg once daily | 120 mg once daily (if needed) |

---

Higher doses (above 60 mg/day) **do not consistently provide additional benefit** and may increase the risk of adverse effects [^1166UYqP] [^11575NTm].

---

## Side effects and tolerability

Common side effects of Cymbalta include:

- Nausea
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth
- Constipation
- Fatigue
- Insomnia
- Somnolence
- Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) [^114QPDpn]

These side effects are **generally mild to moderate** and often improve over time. However, some patients may experience more severe adverse effects, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments.

---

## Serious adverse effects and warnings

Cymbalta carries several **important warnings and precautions**:

- **Suicidal ideation**: Increased risk in children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly during the initial treatment period or dose changes [^112mWMHe].
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Rare cases of liver injury, including hepatitis and jaundice, have been reported [^113M3rLc].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk increases when combined with other serotonergic medications [^1178DXJE].
- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Gradual tapering is recommended to avoid withdrawal symptoms [^116yjmvj].

---

## Comparison with other anxiety medications

Cymbalta's efficacy in treating GAD is **comparable to other first-line treatments**, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other SNRIs like venlafaxine [^116gFJxg] [^113iCTmR]. However, individual patient responses vary, and medication choice should be tailored based on clinical presentation, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^115Butpj].

---

## Patient populations and clinical considerations

Cymbalta is **particularly beneficial** for patients with:

- **Generalized anxiety disorder**: Both adult and pediatric populations [^1162zhQY] [^114bcLdw].
- **Comorbid depression and anxiety**: Dual benefits due to its mechanism of action [^116WLMDU].
- **Chronic pain conditions**: Such as fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy, which often co-occur with anxiety [^1162zhQY].

However, caution is advised in patients with:

- **Liver disease**: Cymbalta is contraindicated in patients with chronic liver disease [^116TxEDj].
- **Seizure disorders**: Use with caution due to potential risk [^1178DXJE].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Weigh potential risks and benefits carefully [^115swZdo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend Cymbalta as a **first-line pharmacological treatment** for generalized anxiety disorder, particularly in patients with comorbid depression or chronic pain conditions. Regular monitoring of efficacy, side effects, and patient adherence is essential to optimize treatment outcomes [^112mWMHe].

---

Cymbalta (duloxetine) is **effective for treating generalized anxiety disorder** in adults and pediatric patients aged 7 years and older, with clinical evidence supporting its efficacy and safety. It is not FDA-approved for other anxiety disorders, though off-label use may be considered in select cases. Careful monitoring for side effects, adherence to dosing guidelines, and consideration of patient-specific factors are essential for successful treatment outcomes.

GAD Trials in Adults (Including Geriatric Patients)

The efficacy of CYMBALTA in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively).

In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily.

Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with CYMBALTA doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N = 168 and N = 162) compared to placebo (N = 159 and N = 161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated CYMBALTA dosages of 60 mg once daily (N = 168) and 120 mg once daily (N = 170) compared to placebo (N = 175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta) [^111MtfyU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In all 3 trials, CYMBALTA demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities.

In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received CYMBALTA 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of CYMBALTA at the same dosage (N = 216) or to placebo (N = 213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥ 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking CYMBALTA experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2).

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

Adult Clinical Trial Database

The data described below reflect exposure to CYMBALTA in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N = 3779), GAD (N = 1018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and FM (N = 1294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received CYMBALTA dosages of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of CYMBALTA for the treatment of GAD in patients ≥ 65 years old (Study GAD-5) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials

Major Depressive Disorder

Approximately 8.4% (319/3779) of CYMBALTA-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 4.6% (117/2536) of placebo-treated patients. Nausea (CYMBALTA 1.1%, placebo 0.4%) was the only adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., discontinuation occurring in at least 1% of the CYMBALTA-treated patients and at a rate of at least twice that of placebo-treated patients).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Approximately 13.7% (139/1018) of the CYMBALTA-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for GAD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5% (38/767) for placebo-treated patients. Common adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (CYMBALTA 3.3%, placebo 0.4%), and dizziness (CYMBALTA 1.3%, placebo 0.4%).

2.2	Dosage for Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Adults — For most patients, initiate Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg once daily dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. Nevertheless, if a decision is made to increase the dose beyond 60 mg once daily, increase dose in increments of 30 mg once daily. The safety of doses above 120 mg once daily has not been adequately evaluated. Periodically reassess to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

2.3	Dosage for Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain

Administer Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that doses higher than 60 mg confer additional significant benefit and the higher dose is clearly less well tolerated [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. For patients for whom tolerability is a concern, a lower starting dose may be considered.

Since diabetes is frequently complicated by renal disease, consider a lower starting dose and gradual increase in dose for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage for Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Administer Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. Begin treatment at 30 mg for one week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that higher doses confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg dose, and higher doses are associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta) [^114eLscY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric CYMBALTA trials. There were suicides in the adult CYMBALTA trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about CYMBALTA effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Use of CYMBALTA for the treatment of GAD in patients 7 to 17 years of age is supported by one 10-week, placebo-controlled trial (GAD-6). The study included 272 pediatric patients with GAD of which 47% were 7 to 11 years of age (53% were 12 to 17 years of age). CYMBALTA demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

The safety and effectiveness of CYMBALTA for the treatment of GAD in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age have not been established.

Fibromyalgia

Use of CYMBALTA for treatment of fibromyalgia in patients 13 to 17 years of age is supported by a 13-week placebo-controlled trial in 184 patients with juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome (Study FM-4). CYMBALTA showed improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint, change from baseline to end-of-treatment on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) – Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version 24-hour average pain severity rating [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

The safety and effectiveness of CYMBALTA for the treatment of fibromyalgia in patients less than 13 years of age have not been established.

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of CYMBALTA have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of MDD. Efficacy of CYMBALTA was not demonstrated in two 10-week, placebo-controlled trials with 800 pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years old with MDD (MDD-6 and MDD-7). Neither CYMBALTA nor an active control (approved for treatment of pediatric MDD) was superior to placebo.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the MDD pediatric clinical trials included nausea, headache, decreased weight, and abdominal pain. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs and SNRIs.

5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome

Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking CYMBALTA. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in CYMBALTA-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with CYMBALTA. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].

5.8 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

In adult placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, activation of mania or hypomania was reported in 0.1% (4/3779) of CYMBALTA-treated patients and 0.04% (1/2536) of placebo-treated patients. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, CYMBALTA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.

5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including CYMBALTA may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

6.1	Clinical Trial Data Sources

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Reactions reported during the studies were not necessarily caused by the therapy, and the frequencies do not reflect investigator impression (assessment) of causality.

Adults — The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine in placebo-controlled trials for MDD (N = 3779), GAD (N = 1018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and another indication (N = 1294). The population studied was 17 to 89 years of age; 65.7%, 60.8%, 60.6%, 42.9%, and 94.4% female; and 81.8%, 72.6%, 85.3%, 74.0%, and 85.7% Caucasian for MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and another indication, respectively. Most patients received doses of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Information describing two additional clinical studies in which efficacy was not demonstrated in patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. Other pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from published literature report the presence of duloxetine in human milk (see Data). There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain in infants exposed to duloxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effect of duloxetine on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CYMBALTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CYMBALTA or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to CYMBALTA should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

Disposition of CYMBALTA was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum and had elected to wean their infants. The women were given 40 mg of CYMBALTA twice daily for 3.5 days. The peak concentration measured in breast milk occurred at a median of 3 hours after the dose. The amount of CYMBALTA in breast milk was approximately 7 mcg/day while on that dose; the estimated daily infant dose was approximately 2 mcg/kg/day, which is less than 1% of the maternal dose. The presence of CYMBALTA metabolites in breast milk was not examined.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of CYMBALTA have been established for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in patients 7 to 17 years of age and for treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in patients 13 to 17 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of CYMBALTA have not been established in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, or chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric patients. Monitor all pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dosage changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^112PGQqX]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability.

Methods

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed.

Results

Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.

14. CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of duloxetine has been established in the following adequate and well-controlled trials:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): 4 short-term and 1 maintenance trial in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): 3 short-term trials in adults, 1 maintenance trial in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP): Two 12-week trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].
Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: Two 12- to 13-week trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and one 13-week trial in adult patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Aged 7 to 17 Years Old with MDD and GAD

The adverse reaction profile observed in clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 7 to 18 years old with MDD and GAD was consistent with the adverse reaction profile observed in adult clinical trials. The most common (≥ 5% and twice placebo) adverse reactions observed in these pediatric clinical trials included: nausea, diarrhea, decreased weight, and dizziness.

Table 6 provides the incidence of adverse reactions in MDD and GAD pediatric placebo-controlled trials that occurred in greater than 2% of patients treated with CYMBALTA and with an incidence greater than patients treated with placebo. CYMBALTA is not approved in the treatment of MDD in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Other adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of less than 2% and were reported by more CYMBALTA-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in pediatric MDD and GAD clinical trials included: abnormal dreams (including nightmare), anxiety, flushing (including hot flush), hyperhidrosis, palpitations, pulse increased, and tremor (CYMBALTA is not approved to treat pediatric patients with MDD).

The most commonly reported symptoms following discontinuation of CYMBALTA in pediatric MDD and GAD clinical trials included headache, dizziness, insomnia, and abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Study CLBP-1: Two hundred thirty-six adult patients (N = 115 on CYMBALTA, N = 121 on placebo) enrolled and 182 (77%) completed 13-week treatment phase. After 7 weeks of treatment, CYMBALTA-treated patients with less than 30% reduction in average daily pain and who were able to tolerate 60 mg once daily had their CYMBALTA dosage, in a double-blinded fashion, increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking CYMBALTA 60–120 mg daily had a significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. Randomization was stratified by the patients' baseline NSAIDs use status. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use.

Study CLBP-2: Four hundred and four patients were randomized to receive fixed dosages of CYMBALTA daily or a matching placebo (N = 59 on CYMBALTA 20 mg, N = 116 on CYMBALTA 60 mg, N = 112 on CYMBALTA 120 mg, N = 117 on placebo) and 267 (66%) completed the entire 13-week trial. After 13 weeks of treatment, none of the three CYMBALTA dosages showed a statistically significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo.

14.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

GAD Trials in Adults (Including Geriatric Patients)

The efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively).

In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily.

Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N = 168 and N = 162) compared to placebo (N = 159 and N = 161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of 60 mg once daily (N = 168) and 120 mg once daily (N = 170) compared to placebo (N = 175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Adverse Reactions Observed in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients

Pediatric Clinical Trial Database

The data described below reflect exposure to CYMBALTA (N = 567) in pediatric patients aged 7 to 18 years of age from two 10-week, placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD (N = 341) (Studies MDD-6 and MDD-7), one 10-week placebo-controlled trial in GAD (N = 135) (Study GAD-6), and a 13-week trial in fibromyalgia (N = 91). CYMBALTA is not approved for the treatment of MDD in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Of the CYMBALTA-treated patients in these studies, 36% were 7 to 11 years of age (64% were between 12 to 18 years old), 55% were female, and 69% were Caucasian. Patients received 30 to 120 mg of CYMBALTA per day during placebo-controlled acute treatment studies. In the pediatric MDD, GAD, and fibromyalgia trials up to 40 weeks long, there were 988 CYMBALTA-treated pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years of age (most patients received 30–120 mg per day) – 35% were 7 to 11 years of age (65% were 12 to 17 years old) and 56% were female.

Most Common Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Trials

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% in CYMBALTA-treated patients and at least twice the incidence of placebo-treated patients) in all pooled pediatric populations (MDD, GAD, and fibromyalgia) were decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and diarrhea.

### Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^116BthVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55).

Authors' Conclusions

Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride [^111FUH4p]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N = 168 and N = 162) compared to placebo (N = 159 and N = 161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of 60 mg once daily (N = 168) and 120 mg once daily (N = 170) compared to placebo (N = 175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit.

In all 3 trials, duloxetine delayed-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities.

In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same dosage (N = 216) or to placebo (N = 213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥ 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2).

### Duloxetine in treatment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression [^116WLMDU]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have symptoms of anxiety associated with their depression. Duloxetine, a potent and balanced dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is effective in the treatmentof depression. We investigated its effects in treating the symptoms of anxiety in depressed patients. This investigation includes all the placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine in MDD but focuses on four trials in which duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) total score. Studies 1 and 2 included duloxetine at 60 mg/d (the recommended starting and therapeutic dose) and placebo. Study 3 included duloxetine 120 mg/d (administered as 60 mg b.i.d.), fluoxetine 20 mg/d, and placebo. Study 4 included duloxetine 40 mg/d (administered as 20 mg b.i.d.), duloxetine 80 mg/d (administered as 40 mg b.i.d.), paroxetine 20 mg/d, and placebo. Anxiety was assessed in all studies using the HAMD anxiety/somatization subfactor and the anxiety-psychic item (HAMD Item 10). Studies 3 and 4 also included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Across the four studies, duloxetine at doses of ≥ 60 mg was compared with placebo on 10 outcomes and with either paroxetine or fluoxetine on 6 outcomes. In 8 comparisons, mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than placebo at the last study visit and/or across all study visits. In 3 comparisons, the mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than paroxetine or fluoxetine. In these studies, duloxetine provided rapid relief of anxiety symptoms associated with depression. Previous reports have summarized duloxetine's efficacy in treating the core emotional symptoms and painful physical symptoms associated with depression. Duloxetine's efficacy in treating a broad spectrum of symptoms associated with depression, including mood, anxiety, and painful physical symptoms, may be attributed to dual reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Efficacy in these three key symptom domains may in turn explain the high probabilities of remission (43–57%) observed in these studies.

WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Efficacy and safety of duloxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a flexible-dose, progressive-titration, placebo-controlled trial [^116ood2W]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a prevalent and chronic illness, is associated with dysregulation in both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. Our study examined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, for short-term treatment of adults with GAD. In a 10-week, double-blind, progressive-titration, flexible-dose trial, 327 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV-defined GAD diagnosis were randomized to duloxetine 60–120 mg (DLX, N = 168) or placebo (PLA, N = 159) treatment. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to endpoint in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) total score. Secondary outcome measures included response rate (HAMA total score reduction ≥ 50% from baseline), Clinician Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores, and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) scores. Patients who received duloxetine treatment demonstrated significantly greater improvement in HAMA total scores (P = 0.02); a higher response rate (P = 0.03), and greater improvement (P = 0.04) than patients who received placebo. Duloxetine-treated patients were also significantly more improved than placebo-treated patients on SDS global functional (P < .01) and work, social, and family/home impairment scores (P < .05). The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) was higher for the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.002). The AEs most frequently associated with duloxetine were nausea, dizziness, and somnolence. Duloxetine was an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated treatment that resulted in clinically significant improvements in symptom severity and functioning for patients with GAD.

### Duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a double-blind clinical trial [^116fcr6R]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression.

Method

In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18–65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. (N = 33). Duloxetine dose was titrated in the first 3 weeks in a forced-titration regimen from 40 mg (20 mg b.i.d.) to 120 mg/day (60 mg b.i.d.). Patients were required to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness scale score of at least moderate severity (≥ 4) and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score of at least 15. Patients could not have had any current primary DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, or any anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis within the past year, excluding specific phobias. The primary efficacy measurement was the HAM-D-17 total score, and secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, CGI-Severity of Illness and CGI-Improvement, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes.

Results

Duloxetine was superior to placebo in change on the HAM-D-17 (p = .009). Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 64% and 56%, respectively, for duloxetine, compared with 52% and 30% for fluoxetine and 48% and 32% for placebo. Duloxetine was numerically superior to fluoxetine on the primary and most of the secondary outcome measures. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.

Conclusion

These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.

14.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

GAD Trials in Adults (Including Geriatric Patients)

The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD. (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively).

In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily.

Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with duloxetine doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N = 168 and N = 162) compared to placebo (N = 159 and N = 161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in the these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated duloxetine dosages of 60 mg once daily (N = 168) and 120 mg once daily (N = 170) compared to placebo (N = 175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit.

### Hepatic outcomes among adults taking duloxetine: a retrospective cohort study in a US health care claims database [^113M3rLc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine (Cymbalta; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) approved in 2004, with indications for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, stress urinary incontinence (in European Union), and chronic pain states associated with chronic lower back pain and osteoarthritis (in some geographies).

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the United States (US) and a frequent reason for withdrawal of a drug from the market. Elevations of alanine aminotransferase to three times the upper limit of normal were observed in clinical trials in approximately 1% of duloxetine-treated depressed recipients. Hepatic injury with a hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed pattern has also been reported rarely in association with duloxetine during the post-marketing period.

What are duloxetine delayed-release capsules?

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are prescription medicine used to treat a certain type of depression called Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Duloxetine delayed-release capsules belong to a class of medicines known as SNRIs (or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are also used to treat or manage:

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP)
Fibromyalgia (FM)
Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Who should not take duloxetine delayed-release capsules?

Do Not take duloxetine delayed-release capsules if you:

### Efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in patients with clinically significant pain symptoms [^113VBLEo]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders often are accompanied by painful physical symptoms. This report assessed the effectiveness of duloxetine in improving anxiety symptoms, pain severity, and patient functioning in adults diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), who presented with clinically significant pain symptoms. Data were pooled from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of duloxetine 60–120 mg once daily compared with placebo in the treatment of GAD. The primary patient population for these analyses was patients with baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) overall pain severity score ≥ 30. Of the 798 randomized patients that had baseline VAS scores, approximately 44.4% of GAD patients were identified as having baseline VAS overall pain severity score ≥ 30 (duloxetine N = 208, placebo N = 146). Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly greater improvement compared with placebo-treated patients on anxiety symptoms (measured by Hamilton Anxiety Scale total score), on patient functioning (measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale Global Functional Impairment Score and across all Sheehan Disability Scale domains), and on all VAS pain items. Patients achieving remission at endpoint, and patients with lower scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement and Patient Global Impression of Improvement scales had greater improvement in VAS pain severity scores. These results suggest that in patients with GAD who present with clinically significant pain symptoms, duloxetine is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, pain severity, and in improving patient functioning.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials

Major Depressive Disorder

Approximately 8.4% (319/3779) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 4.6% (117/2536) of placebo-treated patients. Nausea (duloxetine delayed-release capsules 1.1%, placebo 0.4%) was the only adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., discontinuation occurring in at least 1% of the duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients and at a rate of at least twice that of placebo-treated patients).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Approximately 13.7% (139/1018) of the duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for GAD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5% (38/767) for placebo-treated patients. Common adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (duloxetine delayed-release capsules 3.3%, placebo 0.4%), and dizziness (duloxetine delayed-release capsules 1.3%, placebo 0.4%).

14.2	Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose

The efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1) and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials Studies 2 and 3) in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD.

In 1 flexible-dose trial and in the fixed-dose trial, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily where down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons before increasing it to 60 mg once daily. Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. One flexible-dose study had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily.

The 2 flexible-dose trials involved dose titration with duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N = 168 and N = 162) compared to placebo (N = 159 and N = 161) over a 10 week treatment period. The mean dose for completers at endpoint in the flexible-dose studies was 104.75 mg/day. The fixed-dose study evaluated duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses of 60 mg once daily (N = 168) and 120 mg once daily (N = 170) compared to placebo (N = 175) over a 9 week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit.

### Anxiety does not predict response to duloxetine in major depression: results of a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 11 placebo-controlled trials [^112ea1cp]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled antidepressant trials suggest that anxious patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are less responsive to antidepressant treatment than less anxious patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine.

Methods

This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by ≥ 7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as ≥ 50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD ≤ 7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating.

Results

Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious. Change on the HAMD was greater with duloxetine than placebo in both anxious (9.91 versus 7.55, P < .001) and nonanxious (6.65 versus 5.23, P < .001) patients. Level of anxiety had no effect on the drug-placebo differences. Response and remission rates were significantly greater in duloxetine than placebo-treated patients and drug-placebo differences were unaffected by anxious status. Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define anxious subgroups had similar outcomes.

Conclusions

Duloxetine was more effective than placebo in achieving response and remission in both anxious and nonanxious patients. Anxious status did not affect the magnitude of the drug effect.

### Efficacy of drug treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117SVCCb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To appraise the evidence for comparative efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments in patients with generalised anxiety disorder.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Primary Bayesian probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses allowed pharmacological treatments to be ranked for effectiveness for each outcome measure, given as percentage probability of being the most effective treatment. Secondary frequentist mixed treatment meta-analyses conducted with random effects model; effect size reported as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Health Economic Evaluations Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects via DataStar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library (January 1980 to February 2009). Eligibility criteria Double blind placebo controlled randomised controlled trials; published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials including adult participants (aged ≥ 18) receiving any pharmacological treatment for generalised anxiety disorder. Data abstraction methods Titles or abstracts reviewed initially, followed by review of full text publications for citations remaining after first pass. A three person team conducted screening; an independent reviewer checked a random selection (10%) of articles screened. Data extracted for meta-analysis were also independently reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of participants experiencing ≥ 50% reduction from baseline score on Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) (response), proportion with final HAM-A score ≤ 7 (remission), proportion withdrawing from trial because of adverse events (tolerability).

Results

The review identified 3249 citations, and 46 randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria; 27 trials contained sufficient or appropriate data for inclusion in the analysis. Analyses compared nine drugs (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, lorazepam, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, tiagabine, and venlafaxine). In the primary probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses, fluoxetine was ranked first for response and remission (probability of 62.9% and 60.6%, respectively) and sertraline was ranked first for tolerability (49.3%). In a subanalysis ranking treatments for generalised anxiety disorder currently licensed in the United Kingdom, duloxetine was ranked first for response (third across all treatments; 2.7%), escitalopram was ranked first for remission (second across all treatments; 26.7%), and pregabalin was ranked first for tolerability (second across all treatments; 7.7%).

Conclusions

Though the frequentist analysis was inconclusive because of a high level of uncertainty in effect sizes (based on the relatively small number of comparative trials), the probabilistic analysis, which did not rely on significant outcomes, showed that fluoxetine (in terms of response and remission) and sertraline (in terms of tolerability) seem to have some advantages over other treatments. Among five UK licensed treatments, duloxetine, escitalopram, and pregabalin might offer some advantages over venlafaxine and paroxetine.

GAD Trial in Geriatric Patients

The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of patients ≥ 65 years of age with GAD was established in one 10-week flexible-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults ≥ 65 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Study GAD-5). In Study GAD-5, the starting dose was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before further dose increases in 30 mg increments at treatment weeks 2, 4, and 7 up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week acute treatment phase was 51 mg. Patients treated with duloxetine (N = 151) demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared with placebo (N = 140) on mean change from baseline to endpoint as measured by the HAM-A total score (see Table 8).

GAD Trial in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years Old

The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD was established in 1 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric outpatients with GAD (based on DSM-IV criteria) (Study GAD-6).

In Study GAD-6, the starting dosage was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Further dosage increases in 30 mg increments up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week treatment phase was 57.6 mg/day. In this study, duloxetine (N = 135) demonstrated superiority over placebo (N = 137) from baseline to endpoint as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score (see Table 9).

12. Clinical Pharmacology

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

### A non-inferiority comparison of duloxetine and venlafaxine in the treatment of adult patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^113iCTmR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

The present study is a non-inferiority comparison of duloxetine 60–120 mg/day and venlafaxine extended-release (XR) 75–225 mg/day for the treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The non-inferiority test was a prespecified plan to pool data from two nearly identical 10-week, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of duloxetine 60–120 mg/day and venlafaxine 75–225 mg/ day for the treatment of GAD. An independent expert consensus panel provided six statistical and clinical criteria for determining non-inferiority between treatments. Response was defined as ≥ 50% reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) total score. In the pooled sample, patients were randomly assigned to duloxetine (n = 320), venlafaxine XR (n = 333) or placebo (n = 331). For the non-inferiority analysis, the per-protocol patients who were treated with duloxetine (n = 239) or venlafaxine XR (n = 262) improved significantly more (mean HAMA reductions were -15.4 and -15.2, respectively) than placebo-treated patients (n = 267; -11.6, P ≤ 0.001, both comparisons). Response rates were 56%, 58% and 40%, respectively. Discontinuation rate because of AEs was significantly higher for duloxetine (13.4%, P ≤ 0.001) and venlafaxine XR (11.4%, P ≤ 0.01) groups compared with placebo (5.4%). Duloxetine 60–120 mg/day met all statistical and clinical criteria for non-inferiority and exhibited a similar tolerability profile compared with venlafaxine XR 75–225 mg/day for the treatment of adults with GAD.

### Pharmacological treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116gFJxg]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease that can be associated with substantial dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment is often the first choice for clinicians because of the cost and resource constraints of psychological alternatives, but there is a paucity of comparative information for the multiple available drug choices.

Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomised trials in adult outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang data, Drugs@FDA and commercial pharmaceutical registries. Placebo and active control trials were included. Data were extracted from all manuscripts and reports. Primary outcomes were efficacy (mean difference [MD] in change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score) and acceptability (study discontinuations for any cause). We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018087106.

Findings

Studies were published between Jan 1, 1994 and Aug 1, 2017, in which 1992 potential studies were screened for inclusion. This analysis is based on 89 trials, which included 25441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3.13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4.13 to -2.13), pregabalin (MD -2.79, 95% CrI -3.69 to -1.91), venlafaxine (MD -2.69, 95% CrI -3.50 to -1.89), and escitalopram (MD -2.45, 95% CrI -3.27 to -1.63) were more efficacious than placebo with relatively good acceptability. Mirtazapine, sertraline, fluoxetine, buspirone, and agomelatine were also found to be efficacious and well tolerated but these findings were limited by small sample sizes. Quetiapine (MD -3.60 95% CrI -4.83 to -2.39) had the largest effect on HAM-A but it was poorly tolerated (odds ratio 1.44, 95% CrI 1.16–1.80) when compared with placebo. Likewise, paroxetine and benzodiazepines were effective but also poorly tolerated when compared with placebo. Risk of reporting bias was considered low, and when possible all completed studies were included to avoid publication bias.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary review of pharmacological agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder by use of network analysis. There are several effective treatment choices for generalised anxiety disorder across classes of medication. The failure of initial pharmacological therapy might not be a reason to abandon a pharmacological treatment strategy.

### Duloxetine [^111PeBAV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In all 3 trials, duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities.

In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by a least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement)score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of duloxetine at the same dosage (n = 216) or to placebo (N = 213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥ 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking duloxetine experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo. (see Figure 2).

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules have been established for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) inpatients 7 to 17 years of age and for treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in patients 13 to 17 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been established in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, or chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric patients. Monitor all pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dosage changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Perform regular monitoring of weight and growth in pediatric patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Use of duloxetine for the treatment of GAD in patients 7 to 17 years of age is supported by one 10-week, placebo controlled trial (GAD-6). The study included 272 pediatric patients with GAD of which 47% were 7 to 11 years of age (53% were 12 to 17 years of age). Duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score

### Generalised anxiety disorder [^111armNe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to one in five people may have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) at some point, and most have other health problems. Less than half of people have full remission after 5 years. GAD may have a genetic component, and has also been linked to previous psychological or other trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for GAD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 74 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: abecarnil, antidepressants (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, opipramol, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine), antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine), applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, buspirone, cognitive behavioural therapy, hydroxyzine, and pregabalin.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride DR [^1178DXJE]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of duloxetine hydrochloride DR PO (also known as Cymbalta):

- **1-naphthol toxicity**: use caution in patients with delayed gastric emptying, as extremely acidic conditions can facilitate the hydrolysis of duloxetine to form naphthol.
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.
- **Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Bleeding, hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Obtain BP monitoring. Recognize that the risk of bleeding is higher with concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics. Discontinue duloxetine if symptomatic hyponatremia develops.
- **Exacerbation of increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with diabetes.
- **Increased serum transaminases, jaundice, ALF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue duloxetine if jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction occurs.
- **Manic or mixed episodes**: use caution in patients with major depressive disorder at risk for bipolar disorder. Screen patients for personal and family history of bipolar disorder before initiating duloxetine.
- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, falls**: use caution in elderly patients and in patients taking concomitant medications inducing orthostatic hypotension, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, or receiving duloxetine doses > 60 mg/day. Reduce the dose or discontinue duloxetine as needed.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use extreme caution in patients taking other serotonergic drugs. Obtain monitoring in all patients.

### Onset of action for duloxetine 60 mg once daily: double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^116vov8G]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is widely believed that most antidepressant medications exhibit a delay of 2–4 weeks before clinically relevant improvement can be observed among patients. During this latency period, patients continue to be symptomatic and functionally impaired. Thus, time to onset of effect is an important attribute of a new pharmacotherapy. We assessed the onset of effect for duloxetine, utilizing analytical methods previously recommended in the literature.

Method

Efficacy data were pooled from two identical, but independent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 9-week clinical trials of duloxetine (60 mg QD). Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(17)), HAMD(17) subscales (Maier, core, and anxiety), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales. In each individual study, duloxetine demonstrated statistically significant advantages over placebo on multiple outcomes. The present analysis utilized pooled data to more accurately and fully characterize the onset of effect for duloxetine.

Results

Median times to sustained improvements of 10% and 20% in the HAMD(17) total score among duloxetine-treated patients were 14 days and 21 days, respectively, compared with 34 days and 49 days, respectively, for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001 for both results). The median time to sustained 30% improvement in HAMD(17) total score was 35 days for duloxetine-treated patients, while the median time for placebo-treated patients was not estimable since less than half of the patients met this criterion by the end of the trial. For duloxetine-treated patients, median times to sustained 10%, 20%, and 30% improvements on the Maier subscale of the HAMD(17) were the same as those for the HAMD(17) total score: 14, 21, and 35 days, respectively. However, in other analyses, changes in core emotional symptoms as measured by subscales of the HAMD(17) were somewhat faster than changes in overall symptomatology. The probabilities of achieving a sustained 30% improvement (Maier subscale) at Week 1 for duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients were 16.2% vs. 4.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). The corresponding probabilities of sustained improvement at Weeks 2 and 3 for duloxetine were 32.5% and 45.4%, respectively, compared to 12.8% and 21.4% for placebo ((p < 0.001 for both comparisons).

Conclusion

The absence of an active comparator limits the conclusions which can be drawn regarding the rapidity of onset of clinically meaningful improvement. However, results from the present investigation may be useful to clinicians in consideration of treatment options for individual patients.

### Examining quality of life in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: clinical relevance and response to duloxetine treatment [^1119Zf1X]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine, a serotonergic noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, improved functional outcomes in each of three clinical studies for the treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Using comparison norms, the current work describes the clinical relevance of these functional improvements in terms of return to normative functioning and symptom remission.

Methods

Data were pooled at the individual patient level from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine treatment (9–10 weeks acute therapy, dose ranges 60–120mg). Inclusion/exclusion criteria were consistent across studies, and outcome measures included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).

Results

Adult patients (mean age = 42.4 years; 65% women) were randomly assigned to duloxetine (N = 668) or placebo (N = 495). At baseline, the majority of patients were impaired on the SDS global functioning (89%), Q-LES-Q-SF maximum percent (95%), and EQ-5D (76%) scores. On each measure, a greater percentage of duloxetine-treated patients converted from an impaired baseline to a normative endpoint score than did placebo-treated patients (p0.001, all comparisons). Remission defined as a HAMA total score at endpoint of 10, compared with 7, captured a greater proportion of patients who were functionally in remission.

Conclusions

GAD is associated with substantial impairment in functioning and subjective well-being, and patients treated with duloxetine 60–120mg/day, compared with placebo, experienced a greater return to normative functioning. Attention to role functioning and quality of life may refine our definition of remission when using standard symptom measures of anxiety.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules have been established for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in patients 7 to 17 years of age and for treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in patients 13 to 17 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine have not been established in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, or chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric patients. Monitor all pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dosage changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Perform regular monitoring of weight and growth in pediatric patients treated with duloxetine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients 7 to 17 years of age is supported by one 10-week, placebo-controlled trial (GAD-6). The study included 272 pediatric patients with GAD of which 47% were 7 to 11 years of age (53% were 12 to 17 years of age). Duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

The most commonly reported symptoms following discontinuation of duloxetine in pediatric MDD and GAD clinical trials included headache, dizziness, insomnia, and abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Growth (Height and Weight) in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years Old with GAD and MDD

Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs and SNRIs. Duloxetine-treated pediatric patients in clinical trials experienced a 0.1 kg mean decrease in weight at 10 weeks, compared with a mean weight gain of approximately 0.9 kg in placebo-treated pediatric patients. The proportion of patients who experienced a clinically significant decrease in weight (≥ 3.5%) was greater in the duloxetine group than in the placebo group (16% and 6%, respectively). Subsequently, over the 4- to 6-month uncontrolled extension periods, duloxetine -treated patients on average trended toward recovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from age- and sex-matched peers.

In studies up to 9 months, duloxetine-treated pediatric patients experienced an increase in height of 1.7 cm on average (2.2 cm increase in patients 7 to 11 years of age and 1.3 cm increase in patients 12 to 17 years of age). While height increase was observed during these studies, a mean decrease of 1% in height percentile was observed (decrease of 2% in patients 7 to 11 years of age and increase of 0.3% in patients 12 to 17 years of age). Weight and height should be monitored regularly in pediatric patients treated with duloxetine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules is in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance. If symptoms of urinary hesitation develop during treatment with Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules, consideration should be given to the possibility that they might be drug-related.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption and Distribution — Orally administered duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets in the treatment of refractory chronic cough [^113k84hh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Refractory cough, a chronic cough with an unclear diagnosis or poor treatment response. The symptoms are often stubborn and persistent, causing serious complications and lowering the patient's quality of life. Cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) is proposed as a potential cause, and reducing sensory nerve hyperresponsiveness is suggested as an effective treatment. However, current drugs have low efficacy and benefit rates and numerous side effects. This trail proposes using duloxetine, a selective 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, as a potential treatment for refractory cough, which has shown promise in treating pain and depression. Duloxetine may inhibit pain conduction and oxidative stress in peripheral nerves by inhibiting the activity of TRPV1 channels, which play an important role in the peripheral afferent pathway of refractory cough. Meanwhile, the antidepressant effects of duloxetine may also play a role in the treatment of refractory cough.

Methods and Analysis

This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial. A total of 98 individuals will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to duloxetine group and placebo control group (starting with 20 mg QD, increasing 20 mg daily until 20 mg TID). After a screening period, the second stage runs from baseline to the 42nd (last) day of treatment, with follow-up visits on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, 42nd and 49th days. The main end-stage observation indicators include objective cough frequency, cough visual analog scale (VAS), cough symptom score, Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), and cough evaluation test (CET); the secondary end-stage observation indicators include capsaicin cough sensitivity, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), Life Events Scale (LES-32), induced sputum supernatant. The safety measures will be AEs/SAEs, vital signs, liver and kidney function, fecal occult blood test.

Discussion

This study is the first randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical trial investigating the use of duloxetine in the treatment of refractory coughs. The study aims to provide a high-quality basis for evaluating the efficacy and safety of duloxetine for this condition.

Trial Registration

Our study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (www.chictr.org.cn/) (ChiCTR2000037429) in 28/08/2020.

### Early improvement during duloxetine treatment of generalized anxiety disorder predicts response and remission at endpoint [^115Butpj]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Because many patients do not respond to pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it would be beneficial to know if early response is predictive of final outcome so that timely clinical decisions can be made about augmentation or alternative treatments. This topic has not been examined with the now recommended first-line treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) for GAD. Combined data from three 9 to 10week acute treatment, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine for GAD were used to explore early improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) in relation to endpoint HAMA response (≥ 50% improvement from baseline), HAMA remission (≤ 7), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) response (≤ 2), and functional remission as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale Global Functional Improvement (≤ 5). For duloxetine-treated patients (n = 668), the relationships between the proportion of patients who achieved each category of early (week 2 and week 4) HAMA improvement (≥ 20%, ≥ 40%, ≥ 60%, and ≥ 80%) and achievement of endpoint HAMA response, HAMA remission, CGI response, and SDS remission status were all statistically significant (all P's ≤ 0.003). One hundred percent of the duloxetine-treated patients who showed substantial HAMA improvement (> 80%) at week 2, and 93% at week 4, were HAMA responders at endpoint. At week 2, 79% of the duloxetine-treated patients who achieved a HAMA improvement of 40–59% were HAMA responders at endpoint. About half of duloxetine-treated patient showing 40–59% early HAMA improvement were remitters on the SDS at endpoint. These data suggest a connection between early improvement and endpoint response and remission status that can be used to guide clinical decision-making.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets in the treatment of refractory chronic cough [^111Xqywm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to possibly improving cough symptoms, the antidepressant effects of 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors may also play a role in the treatment of refractory cough. Psychological symptoms are interrelated with cough severity and quality of life. Chronic cough seriously affects the quality of life of patients, causing fatigue, sleep deprivation, and social withdrawal, leading to increased complications of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. These psychological problems may affect their perception of symptoms and are associated with decreased treatment adherence and slower response to treatment. French et al. found that symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress also gradually improved when cough symptoms were relieved. They believed that psychological factors, symptom experience, and daily functions interacted and influenced each other, so the authors proposed that intervention on the psychological state may also help improve somatic symptoms and quality of life. As a new type of antidepressant, duloxetine has been used in the treatment of depression and generalized anxiety disorder. It has also shown efficacy in patients with somatic symptom disorders, significantly reducing the level of somatization and functional disability. Therefore, duloxetine can reduce the psychological burden of patients and help improve the symptoms of refractory cough. We propose this study to test the hypothesis that duloxetine has a good therapeutic effect on patients with refractory cough.

Research objective

The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether duloxetine can improve symptoms in patients with refractory chronic cough.

Research methods

Through a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we will explore whether duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets can improve the cough symptoms of refractory cough and its underlying mechanisms.

The mean dose for patients completing the 10 week treatment phase was 57.6 mg/day. In this study, duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N = 135) demonstrated superiority over placebo (N = 137) from baseline to endpoint as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score (Study 6 in Table 9).

### The short-and long-term effect of duloxetine on painful physical symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: results from three clinical trials [^1138mFUS]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with painful physical symptoms (PPS). These post hoc analyses of previous trial data assessed PPS and their response to duloxetine treatment in GAD patients. Studies 1 and 2 (n = 840) were 9- to 10-week efficacy trials; study 3 (n = 887) was a relapse prevention trial comprising a 26-week open-label treatment phase and a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment continuation phase. Mean baseline visual analog scale scores (VAS, 0–100; n = 1727) ranged from 26 to 37 for overall pain, headache, back pain, shoulder pain, interference with daily activities, and time in pain while awake. In studies 1 and 2, improvement on all VAS scores was greater in duloxetine-treated than in placebo-treated patients (p ≤ 0.01). In study 3, pain symptoms worsened in responders switched to placebo compared with those maintained on duloxetine (p ≤ 0.02). In conclusion, duloxetine was efficacious in the short- and long-term treatment of PPS, which are common in GAD patients.

### Duloxetine 60 mg for chronic low back pain: post hoc responder analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^111VkUNA]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment protocol

Patients included in this analysis were treated with once-daily oral duloxetine 60 mg (Cymbalta ®; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or placebo for 12–14 weeks.–In 3 trials, patients initiated duloxetine at 20–30 mg/day, which increased to 60 mg/day over the first 1–2 weeks.–In 2 trials, patients in additional study arms received 20 mg/day or 120 mg/day duloxetine;, patients in these study arms were not included in this analysis. In 1 trial, patients who did not respond (≥ 30% pain reduction) to duloxetine 60 mg/day by Week 7 had their dose increased to 120 mg/day (n = 27); those patients were included in this analysis and treated as nonresponders for ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction at end point (Week 12) regardless of their actual BPI scores at that time.

Concomitant analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids) were prohibited in 2 of the trials, other than as episodic rescue medication (short-acting analgesics only, ≤ 3 consecutive days, ≤ 20 total days). The other 2 trials allowed patients who were on stable doses of NSAIDs before study entry (total of 82 patients in the placebo arm, 86 patients in the duloxetine 60 mg/day arm) to continue these medications, but no changes to dose or frequency were allowed. These trials also allowed rescue use of short-acting analgesics, as mentioned earlier. Antidepressants were prohibited in all trials.

### Early effects of duloxetine on emotion recognition in healthy volunteers [^114Bvssi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine is an effective treatment for major depression and generalised anxiety disorder. Neuropsychological models of antidepressant drug action suggest therapeutic effects might be mediated by the early correction of maladaptive biases in emotion processing, including the recognition of emotional expressions. Sub-chronic administration of duloxetine (for two weeks) produces adaptive changes in neural circuitry implicated in emotion processing; however, its effects on emotional expression recognition are unknown. Forty healthy participants were randomised to receive either 14 days of duloxetine (60 mg/day, titrated from 30 mg after three days) or matched placebo (with sham titration) in a double-blind, between-groups, repeated-measures design. On day 0 and day 14 participants completed a computerised emotional expression recognition task that measured sensitivity to the six primary emotions. Thirty-eight participants (19 per group) completed their course of tablets and were included in the analysis. Results provide evidence that duloxetine, compared to placebo, may reduce the accurate recognition of sadness. Drug effects were driven by changes in participants' ability to correctly detect subtle expressions of sadness, with greater change observed in the placebo relative to the duloxetine group. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in mood. Our preliminary findings require replication, but complement recent evidence that sadness recognition is a therapeutic target in major depression, and a mechanism through which SNRIs could resolve negative biases in emotion processing to achieve therapeutic effects.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of patients who experienced, at least once, one treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Adverse Reactions in Adults

Adult Clinical Trial Database

The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine delayed-release capsules in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N = 3779), GAD (N = 1018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and FM (N = 1294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients ≥ 65 years old (Study GAD-5) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population.

### Should we Be treating affective symptoms, like anxiety and depression which may Be related to LUTD in patients with OAB? ICI-RS 2024 [^112JQkMG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a small open‐label, single‐arm pilot study, 10 patients (median age: 72 years) with drug‐resistant OAB underwent a face‐to‐face intervention consisting of six 30‐min sessions over 6−12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed using self‐reported questionnaires and frequency voiding charts (FVC) at baseline, during, post‐intervention, and follow‐up. Two participants dropped out, but among the remaining eight, OAB Questionnaire subscale scores improved (effect size: 0.75–1.73), and mean urinary frequency decreased from 9.0 (SD: 2.1) to 6.2 (SD: 1.2) voids per day. Participants reported satisfaction with no adverse events observed.

In a study on medical therapy for affective disorders, 306 women with OAB symptoms, were treated with either duloxetine (an SNRI) or a placebo. Those on duloxetine, starting at 40 mg and increasing to 60 mg twice daily after 4 weeks, demonstrated a significant reduction in voiding episodes, increased daytime voiding intervals and reduced urgency incontinence from baseline to 12 weeks. Additionally, duloxetine significantly improved "avoidance and limiting behaviour" and "psychosocial impact" scores in the Incontinence Quality of Life (IQOL) questionnaire. Duloxetine, which is licensed for treatment of affective disorders, has been shown to improve symptoms of both depression and anxiety in adults.

Current literature suggests that treating affective disorders with psychological therapy or antidepressants may improve LUTD, particularly in patients with refractory symptoms with significant psychological comorbidities. Further research is necessary to identify which patients warrant psychiatric evaluation, which subgroups would benefit from treating affective disorders to improve their LUTD, and whether combined medical therapy is effective for managing both LUTD and affective disorders.

14.2 Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for MDD in adults was established in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials in adult outpatients (18 to 83 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD:

In Studies MDD-1 and MDD-2, patients were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg once daily (N = 123 and N = 128, respectively) or placebo (N = 122 and N = 139, respectively) for 9 weeks
In Study MDD-3, patients were randomized to duloxetine 20 or 40 mg twice daily (N = 86 and N = 91, respectively) or placebo (N = 89) for 8 weeks
In Study MDD-4, patients were randomized to duloxetine 40 or 60 mg twice daily (N = 95 and N = 93, respectively) or placebo (N = 93) for 8 weeks.

In all four trials, duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score (see Table 8). There is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefits.

In all of these clinical trials, analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

In Study MDD-5, 533 adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD received duloxetine 60 mg once daily during an initial 12-week open-label treatment phase. Two hundred and seventy-eight patients who responded to open label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 10 and 12: a HAMD-17 total score ≤ 9, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) ≤ 2, and not meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD] were randomly assigned to continuation of duloxetine at the same dosage (N = 136) or to placebo (N = 142) for 6 months.

In Study MDD-5, patients on duloxetine delayed-release capsules experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of depression than did patients on placebo (see Figure 1). Relapse was defined as an increase in the CGI-S score of ≥ 2 points compared with that obtained at week 12, as well as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD at 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, where the 2-week temporal criterion had to be satisfied at only the second visit.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled study of duloxetine for the treatment of children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder [^115DZ9Hi]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the selective serotonin norepinephrine inhibitor duloxetine in children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Method

Youth aged 7 through 17 years with a primary diagnosis of GAD were treated with flexibly dosed duloxetine (30–120 mg daily, n = 135) or placebo (n = 137) for 10 weeks, followed by open-label duloxetine (30–120mg daily) for 18 weeks. Efficacy measures included the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-Severity) scale, and Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Safety measures included the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) as well as vital signs and electrocardiographic and laboratory monitoring.

Results

On the primary efficacy measure (PARS severity for GAD), mean improvement from baseline to 10 weeks was statistically significantly greater for duloxetine (-9.7) compared with placebo (-7.1, p ≤ .001, Cohen's d: 0.5). Symptomatic response (50% improvement on the PARS severity for GAD), remission (PARS severity for GAD ≤ 8), and functional remission (CGAS > 70) rates for the duloxetine group (59%, 50%, 37%, respectively) were statistically significantly greater than for the placebo group (42%, 34%, 24%, respectively, p ≤ .05) during acute treatment. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and discontinuation because of adverse events did not statistically differ between the duloxetine and placebo groups, although gastrointestinal-related adverse events, oropharyngeal pain, dizziness, cough, and palpitations were reported with a statistically significantly greater incidence for the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group. Mean changes in pulse and weight for the duloxetine group (+6.5 beats/min, -0.1 kg, respectively) were statistically different from the placebo group (+2.0 beats/min, +1.1 kg, respectively, p ≤ .01).

Conclusion

In this study, duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary efficacy analysis of mean change from baseline to week 10 on the PARS severity for GAD score, and safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of duloxetine in pediatric and adult patients.

### Duloxetine [^116hCGbH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine is in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

3. Results

3.1. Patient baseline characteristics

A total of 1320 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, resulting in 641 receiving treatment with duloxetine and 679 receiving placebo (Table 2). Most of the patients were female (69.7%) and Caucasian (81.8%). The mean age (SD) of the patients was 46.5 (12.99) years. The mean baseline MADRS total score (SD) and BPI-SF average pain score (SD) were 29.9 (2.83) and 5.7 (1.63), respectively. Within this population, 25.5% were undergoing their first MDD episode. Gender and ethnicity distributions, age, and baseline illness characteristics were similar between duloxetine and placebo groups (Table 2).

Table 2
Baseline characteristics (all randomized patients).

3.1.1. Patient disposition

At the end of the 8-week treatment, there was no significant difference in the numbers of patients discontinued early between duloxetine and placebo groups (duloxetine: 15.9% vs placebo: 16.2%). A significantly (P = 0.0033) greater number of patients discontinued treatment for lack of efficacy in the placebo group (4.4%) compared with that in the duloxetine group (1.6%). There was no significant difference (P = 0.2261) between the duloxetine (5.3%) and placebo (3.8%) groups in discontinuation due to adverse events (Table 3).

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^114QQn6Y]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorders. Medications from the SNRI class currently marketed in the United States are venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and levomilnacipran; atomoxetine is not further addressed because the effectiveness of atomoxetine for the treatment of anxiety as the primary disorder has not been established. Duloxetine is the only SNRI to have an FDA indication for the treatment of any anxiety disorder (specifically, generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents 7–17 years old). For dosing, venlafaxine extended release, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine have sufficiently long elimination half-lives to permit single daily dosing, whereas venlafaxine immediate release may require twice- or thrice-daily dosing. Adverse effects of SNRIs can include diaphoresis, dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, tremor, insomnia, somnolence, decreased appetite, weight loss, sustained clinical hypertension, increased blood pressure, and increased pulse; uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior (through age 24 years), behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine may be associated with greater suicide risk than the other SNRIs, both venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine have been associated with overdose fatalities, and venlafaxine also has been associated with discontinuation symptoms. Duloxetine has been associated with hepatic failure and cholestatic jaundice, and duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction; severe skin reactions can occur and accordingly duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or other signs of hypersensitivity. Concomitant administration of any of the SNRIs and any of the MAOIs is contraindicated because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome; duloxetine may interact with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and compared to SSRIs, venlafaxine may have the least effect on the CYP450 system. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication choice.

### Improvement of psychic and somatic symptoms in adult patients with generalized anxiety disorder: examination from a duloxetine, venlafaxine extended-release and placebo-controlled trial [^113DfpBk]. Psychological Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine and venlafaxine extended-release (XR) treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with a secondary focus on psychic and somatic symptoms within GAD.

Method

The design was a 10-week, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled study of duloxetine (20 mg or 60–120 mg once daily) and venlafaxine XR (75–225 mg once daily) treatment. Efficacy was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), which includes psychic and somatic factor scores. Tolerability was measured by occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and discontinuation rates.

Results

Adult out-patients (mean age 42.8 years; 57.1% women) with DSM-IV-defined GAD were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 170), duloxetine 20 mg (n = 84), duloxetine 60–120 mg (n = 158) or venlafaxine XR 75–225 mg (n = 169) treatment. Each of the three active treatment groups had significantly greater improvements on HAMA total score from baseline to endpoint compared with placebo (p = 0.01–0.001). For the HAMA psychic factor score, both duloxetine treatment arms and venlafaxine XR demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared with placebo (p = 0.01–0.001). For the HAMA somatic factor score, the mean improvement in the duloxetine 60–120 mg and venlafaxine XR groups was significantly greater than placebo (p0.05 and p0.01 respectively), whose mean improvement did not differ from the duloxetine 20 mg group (p = 0.07). Groups did not differ in study discontinuation rate due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Duloxetine and venlafaxine treatment were each efficacious for improvement of core psychic anxiety symptoms and associated somatic symptoms for adults with GAD.

### Duloxetine treatment for role functioning improvement in generalized anxiety disorder: three independent studies [^117Lu1ja]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with impaired role functioning and diminished well-being. The present work examined the efficacy of duloxetine treatment for improving functional outcomes for patients with GAD in 3 independent clinical studies.

Method

Studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials conducted in adult outpatients with DSM-IV-defined GAD. One study compared 9-week fixed-dose treatment with duloxetine 60 or 120 mg (N = 168 and N = 170, respectively) with placebo (N = 175). The other 2 studies compared 10-week flexible-dose treatment with duloxetine 60–120 mg (study 2, N = 168; study 3, N = 162) with placebo (study 2, N = 159; study 3, N = 161). The main functional outcome measure for each study was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Additional measures were the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form and the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions. The 3 studies were conducted in the time period from June 2004 to November 2005.

Results

Duloxetine-treated patients improved significantly more than placebo-treated patients on SDS global functioning (study 1, p ≤ .001; studies 2 and 3, p ≤ .01) and SDS work, social life, and family/home responsibility scores (p values range from ≤ .05 to ≤ .001). At treatment endpoint, a greater percentage of duloxetine-treated patients had obtained SDS global functioning scores in the normative range than placebo-treated patients (p values range from ≤ .05 to ≤ .001). Duloxetine-treated patients also reported greater increases in quality of life, well-being, and health compared with the placebo group on the other functional measures (p values range from ≤ .05 to ≤ .001).

Conclusions

Duloxetine consistently reduced role functioning disabilities associated with GAD and enhanced patients' quality of life and well-being in 3 independent clinical studies.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials

Major Depressive Disorder

Approximately 8.4% (319/3779) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules -treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 4.6% (117/2536) of placebo-treated patients. Nausea (duloxetine 1.1%, placebo 0.4%) was the only adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., discontinuation occurring in at least 1% of the duloxetine treated patients and at a rate of at least twice that of placebo-treated patients).

### Efficacy and safety of duloxetine 60 mg and 120 mg daily in patients hospitalized for severe depression: a double-blind randomized trial [^117ELuQV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether hospitalized patients with severe depression and potential suicidal ideation/behavior have earlier and better response to duloxetine 120 mg daily than 60 mg daily.

Method

Adults from 34 sites in 4 countries with severe major depressive disorder, defined by DSM-IV criteria, who were demonstrating Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores ≥ 30, 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-6) scores ≥ 12, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) ≥ 4 and hospitalized ≥ 2 weeks underwent double-blind treatment with either duloxetine 60 mg (n = 167) or 120 mg (n = 171) daily for 8 weeks. Patients treated with 60 mg/d who did not respond had their doses titrated up to 120 mg/d. Primary outcome was the difference in baseline to week 4 change in MADRS scores between the groups. Secondary outcomes were baseline to week 8 changes in MADRS and HDRS-6 scores, response and remission, CGI-S scores, CGI-Improvement scores, Patient Global Impressions-Improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, and Reasons For Living inventory results. Safety was also assessed. The study was conducted between February 9, 2007, and August 26, 2008.

Results

There was no significant difference in mean baseline to week 4 MADRS score change between the 60-mg (-20.1) and 120-mg (-19.9) groups (P = 0.88). At week 4, 96/166 (60 mg) and 106/170 (120 mg) patients responded and maintained responses at week 8 by further decreasing mean MADRS scores to 5.8 (60 mg) and 5.6 (120 mg). At week 8, 226/336 (67.3%) patients achieved remission, with no difference demonstrated between groups. Most secondary efficacy measures were significantly reduced from baseline to week 8 within each group and did not differ between groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events observed with > 10% frequency in both groups were headache and nausea.

Conclusions

Duloxetine 60-mg and 120-mg doses were equally effective and demonstrated no significant differences in treating severe depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients. The safety and tolerability profile of duloxetine in both dosages did not differ and was similar to those reported in previous duloxetine studies.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets in the treatment of refractory chronic cough [^116d1gJ2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Research content and methods

(1) We will compare the starting time and effectiveness rate of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets vs. placebo for the reduction of cough symptoms and somatic symptoms in patients with refractory cough. We will also observe whether duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets can relieve or control cough symptoms in patients. (2) After discontinuation of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets, the change pattern and effectiveness rate against cough and somatic symptoms of the two groups of patients will be compared, and will determined whether there is a continuation effect of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets after drug discontinuation.

(3) We will compare the changes on the objective cough frequency, cough visual analog scale (VAS), cough symptom score, Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), cough evaluation test (CET), capsaicin cough sensitivity, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), Life Events Scale (LES-32), and induced sputum supernatant at each time point to explore whether duloxetine acid enteric-coated tablets further improve the quality of life and cough sensitivity of patients with refractory cough.

(4) We will compare the drop-out rate and the completion rate of the treatment course in the two groups of patients to determine whether duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets can improve the treatment adherence and success rate of patients.

The first stage is a screening period of up to 3 days and a lead-in period of up to 4 days. The subjects who sign the informed consent form (ICF) will screened, and the qualified subjects will enter the lead-in period. The second stage runs from baseline to the 42nd (last) day of treatment, with follow-up visits on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, and 42nd days to observe the efficacy and safety of the test drugs. The third stage is the follow-up 1 week after treatment ends.
