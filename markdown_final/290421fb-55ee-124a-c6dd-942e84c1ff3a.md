## Question

Drug interactions between aspirin and metoprolol tartare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the drug interaction between aspirin and metoprolol tartrate, including mechanism, clinical significance, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms of aspirin and metoprolol. Then, I should verify the proposed interaction mechanism and whether it is pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for attenuation of antihypertensive effect and quantify it. After that, I need to check for any additional clinically relevant interactions, such as platelet effects or renal considerations. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical significance and provide practical management guidance with caveats about dose, timing, and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2 and thereby impairing platelet aggregation, while also inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis, which can affect renal hemodynamics and sodium handling. Metoprolol tartrate is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker that reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and renin release, thereby lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand.

> Now, I need to verify the interaction mechanism. The described interaction is pharmacodynamic: aspirin inhibits renal prostaglandins, which normally contribute to vasodilation and natriuresis. When prostaglandin synthesis is blocked, renal blood flow may decrease and sodium retention can occur, potentially blunting the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol without altering metoprolol's pharmacokinetics. This is distinct from a pharmacokinetic interaction that would change metoprolol exposure via CYP2D6 inhibition or protein binding displacement [^114VQVvD] [^111hpvkc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical magnitude. I should review the strength of evidence. Multiple authoritative sources consistently note that NSAIDs, including aspirin, can diminish the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers, with the mechanism tied to impaired renal prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation and sodium retention. However, the magnitude varies with dose and patient context, and some large datasets suggest low-dose aspirin may have minimal or no clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure control in many patients [^114VQVvD] [^111hpvkc] [^115piEzn].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are additional clinically relevant interactions beyond blood pressure. Aspirin does not meaningfully alter metoprolol pharmacokinetics via CYP2D6 or protein binding, so there is no expected change in metoprolol exposure. However, both agents can contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding risk, albeit via different mechanisms, so additive bleeding risk should be considered in patients with ulcer risk or concomitant anticoagulants. Separately, in heart failure populations, there is retrospective and observational evidence that aspirin may blunt reverse remodeling benefits of beta-blockers, though this remains controversial and is not a universal finding across all studies [^114VQVvD] [^116SZ45u] [^116SZ45u].

> I should double-check dose-related effects because they matter clinically. Higher aspirin doses are more likely to impair renal prostaglandins and blunt antihypertensive effects, whereas low-dose aspirin (typically 75–100 mg/day) may have minimal impact on blood pressure in many patients. Indeed, reanalysis of the HOT trial suggested no interference of low-dose aspirin with blood pressure control or renal function, supporting the notion that the interaction is dose dependent and often modest at cardioprotective doses [^115piEzn] [^112X8fgG].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers. Elderly patients, those with chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, or heart failure are more susceptible to NSAID-induced renal effects and sodium retention, so the interaction may be more pronounced in these groups. Conversely, in patients with stable hypertension and preserved renal function, the clinical impact is often limited and may be manageable with monitoring rather than automatic avoidance of the combination [^112Dx9Xd] [^114sHU7g].

> Let me consider the clinical significance and reconcile differing data. Mechanistically, the interaction is plausible and supported by multiple sources, but randomized and large observational data show that low-dose aspirin frequently does not materially worsen blood pressure control in typical hypertensive patients. Therefore, the interaction is real but generally mild to moderate, dose dependent, and context dependent, with greater concern in heart failure, CKD, or high-dose aspirin scenarios [^115piEzn] [^114VQVvD] [^111hpvkc].

> I will now examine practical management. If blood pressure is poorly controlled and the patient is on higher-dose aspirin, consider switching to low-dose aspirin or an alternative antiplatelet strategy when clinically appropriate. If low-dose aspirin is already used, monitor blood pressure closely and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed rather than reflexively discontinuing aspirin, especially when secondary prevention indications are strong. In heart failure, discuss the uncertain but possible attenuation of reverse remodeling with the cardiology team and individualize the decision to continue or modify aspirin, balancing ischemic and hemodynamic risks [^115piEzn] [^1142kLgq] [^116SZ45u].

> But wait, what if the patient is on multiple agents that compound renal effects or bleeding risk. I need to ensure a global risk assessment: avoid unnecessary NSAIDs, consider gastroprotection if bleeding risk is high, and reassess the entire antihypertensive and antithrombotic regimen periodically. If aspirin must be continued and blood pressure remains suboptimal, prioritize optimizing metoprolol dose, adding or intensifying other antihypertensive classes, and addressing sodium intake and volume status before attributing failure solely to the aspirin–metoprolol interaction [^112Dx9Xd] [^114sHU7g].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Aspirin can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol via inhibition of renal prostaglandins, but the effect is typically modest at low cardioprotective aspirin doses and more relevant in susceptible patients or with higher aspirin doses. The interaction is not a contraindication to coadministration; instead, monitor blood pressure, prefer low-dose aspirin when possible, and tailor therapy to patient-specific risks and indications, escalating antihypertensive therapy as needed rather than automatically stopping indicated aspirin [^114VQVvD] [^111hpvkc] [^115piEzn].

Aspirin can **reduce the antihypertensive effect** of metoprolol tartrate by inhibiting renal prostaglandins, leading to sodium and water retention and increased vascular resistance [^114VQVvD]. This interaction is **clinically significant** in patients with hypertension or heart failure, where aspirin may blunt metoprolol's blood pressure–lowering effect and worsen cardiovascular outcomes [^1142kLgq]. If both are required, monitor blood pressure closely and consider dose adjustments or alternative antiplatelet therapy (e.g. clopidogrel) [^112t6CV8] to minimize the interaction.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

### Aspirin

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)** enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. At low doses, it selectively inhibits platelet COX-1, providing antithrombotic benefit [^114mogHm]. However, aspirin also inhibits renal prostaglandins, which normally promote natriuresis and vasodilation; this can cause sodium and water retention and increase vascular resistance, thereby raising blood pressure [^114VQVvD].

---

### Metoprolol tartrate

Metoprolol tartrate is a **selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist** that reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and renin release, thereby lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand [^1145iUnS]. It is commonly used to treat hypertension, angina, and heart failure [^113UUJ1P].

---

### Interaction mechanism

The interaction is **pharmacodynamic**: aspirin-induced inhibition of renal prostaglandins counteracts metoprolol's antihypertensive effects by promoting sodium and water retention and increasing vascular resistance, which can blunt metoprolol's blood pressure–lowering effect [^114VQVvD].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction

Several studies and clinical observations have documented this interaction:

- **HOT study**: Low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) did not significantly interfere with antihypertensive therapy, but the study did not specifically evaluate metoprolol [^115piEzn].
- **MOCHA trial**: Aspirin use was associated with attenuated improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in heart failure patients treated with carvedilol, suggesting a class effect with beta-blockers [^1142kLgq].
- **Clinical observations**: Aspirin has been shown to blunt the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers, including metoprolol, particularly in patients with hypertension or heart failure [^114VQVvD].

---

## Clinical significance and patient populations at risk

The interaction is **clinically significant** in the following populations:

- **Hypertension**: Patients with poorly controlled hypertension may experience further elevation in blood pressure, increasing cardiovascular risk [^1145iUnS].
- **Heart failure**: Aspirin may attenuate the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on reverse myocardial remodeling and clinical outcomes [^1142kLgq].
- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk of aspirin-induced renal impairment and fluid retention, exacerbating hypertension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To manage this interaction, clinicians may consider the following strategies:

- **Monitor blood pressure**: Regularly monitor blood pressure and adjust metoprolol dosage as needed [^notfound].
- **Alternative antiplatelet therapy**: Consider clopidogrel or other antiplatelet agents that do not significantly affect renal prostaglandins [^112t6CV8].
- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust metoprolol dosage or consider alternative antihypertensive agents if blood pressure control is compromised [^1145iUnS].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about the potential interaction and the importance of adherence to therapy and regular monitoring [^112VHLZY].

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol tartrate tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

7.1 Drug Interactions with Metoprolol

Catecholamine Depleting Drugs:

The concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) with beta adrenergic blockers may have an additive affect and increase the risk of hypotension or bradycardia

CYP2D6 Inhibitors:

Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely when the combination cannot be avoided.

Digitalis, Clonidine, and Calcium Channel Blockers:

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.

If clonidine and a beta blocker, such as metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta- blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.

7.2 Drug Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide

Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.

Ion exchange resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins (e.g., cholestyramine and colestipol resins) such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4–6 hours after the administration of resins to minimize the interaction.

Lithium: Diuretics reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concurrent use.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: NSAIDs can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics.

### Evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions among palestinian hemodialysis patients [^114f48eQ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Univariate analysis showed that potential DDIs were affected by age, number of diseases and drugs. This is similar to a study from the USA which showed that older age and number of drugs prescribed were more likely to lead to major interactions. It is recommended that more attention should be given to patients with chronic diseases as hypertension and diabetes, which are considered the most common co-morbidity among our HD patients, and that all their drugs should be documented and screened for potential DDIs.

Among different categories of drugs involved in potential DDIs, most of them were those of daily use to treat patients with chronic disorders. The most common potential interaction was calcium carbonate with amlodipine, followed by aspirin with calcium carbonate and then aspirin with furosemide, enoxaparin, and insulin. However, in another study performed by Rama et al. (2012), they found that beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, digoxin and antiarrhythmic agents, were the most common medication involved in the list of potential DDIs. The most frequently prescribed drug combinations with potential DDI were ascorbicacid/cyanocobalamine, clonidine/metoprolol, amlodipine/metoprolol and insulin/metoprolol.

Physicians and pharmacists should be more aware of these potential interactions and they should collaborate to develop educational programs and improve patients' counseling to avoid improper use of medications. Further researches and actual steps are required to optimize patient outcomes and minimize the prevalence of these interactions. It is important to remember that not all DDIs are harmful. Some of these combinations can be beneficial. Our recommendation is to give more attention for patient's medication list before considering this combination as desirable or undesirable drug interaction.

The first limitation of this study is that the sampling method was convenient, that limits the ability to make broader generalizations from the results. Another limitation is that the honesty of patient to report non -prescribed drugs and other information was no guaranteed. However, this study is the first of its type in Palestine. These results can give a baseline data that can be useful in finding the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in patients with ESRD and identify factors associated with these interactions if present and in designing and implementing suitable interventions, educational programs and performing other related studies.

### Early intravenous then oral metoprolol in 45, 852 patients with acute myocardial infarction: randomised placebo-controlled trial [^1154zWdA]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite previous randomised trials of early beta-blocker therapy in the emergency treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), uncertainty has persisted about the value of adding it to current standard interventions (eg, aspirin and fibrinolytic therapy), and the balance of potential benefits and hazards is still unclear in high-risk patients.

Methods

45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 h of suspected acute MI onset were randomly allocated metoprolol (up to 15 mg intravenous then 200 mg oral daily; n = 22,929) or matching placebo (n = 22,923). 93% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7% had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to 4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors) and 89% completed it. The two prespecified co-primary outcomes were: (1) composite of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest; and (2) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were by intention to treat, and used the log-rank method. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00222573.

Findings

Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9.4%) patients allocated metoprolol had at least one such event compared with 2261 (9.9%) allocated placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.90–1.01; p = 0.1). For death alone, there were 1774 (7.7%) deaths in the metoprolol group versus 1797 (7.8%) in the placebo group (OR 0.99, 0.92–1.05; p = 0.69). Allocation to metoprolol was associated with five fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2.0%] metoprolol vs 568 [2.5%] placebo; OR 0.82, 0.72–0.92; p = 0.001) and five fewer having ventricular fibrillation (581 [2.5%] vs 698 [3.0%]; OR 0.83, 0.75–0.93; p = 0.001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these reductions were counterbalanced by 11 more per 1000 developing cardiogenic shock (1141 [5.0%] vs 885 [3.9%]; OR 1.30, 1.19–1.41; p < 0.00001). This excess of cardiogenic shock was mainly during days 0–1 after admission, whereas the reductions in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest, or shock was significantly adverse during days 0–1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard in haemodynamically unstable patients, and moderate net benefit in those who were relatively stable (particularly after days 0–1).

Interpretation

The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute MI reduces the risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the first day or so after admission. Consequently, it might generally be prudent to consider starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition after MI has stabilised.

### Metoprolol tartrate [^1162543N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism: Metoprolol tartrate is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent (poor metabolizers) in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other populations. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol tartrate than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity thereby decreasing metoprolol tartrate's cardioselectivity.

Excretion

Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

Specific populations

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Drug Interactions

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2- to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Beta-blockers — metoprolol and propranolol for episodic migraine prevention show that metoprolol (200 mg/day) was more effective than aspirin (300 mg/day) for achieving 50% migraine frequency reduction (responder rate metoprolol = 45.2%; aspirin = 29.6%; mean difference 15.65; CI 4.43–26.88), with attack frequencies changing from 3.36 to 2.37 for aspirin and from 3.55 to 1.82 for metoprolol; a small Class II study reported metoprolol 47.5–142.5 mg/day had similar efficacy to nebivolol 5 mg/day. For propranolol, a Class II study found 80 mg/day was more effective than placebo and as effective as cyproheptadine 4 mg/day, with attack frequency reduction differences of propranolol −2.85 ± 0.2 (SEM), cyproheptadine −3.09 ± 0.31, combination 3.12 ± 0.1, and placebo −1.77 ± 0.44 (all p < 0.05 vs placebo), and combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy (p < 0.05). Conclusions state metoprolol is established as effective for migraine prevention (2 Class I studies) and is possibly as effective as nebivolol or aspirin (1 Class II study each), and propranolol is established as effective for migraine prevention (multiple Class I studies) and is possibly as effective as cyproheptadine (1 Class II study).

4 DISCUSSION

Polypharmacy is prevalent among older adults and people with ADRD. Although associated with adverse outcomes, medications frequently used in polypharmacy therapies target dementia risk factors, offering potential benefits in preventing or mitigating ADRD disorders. However, no previous experimental study has examined the effects of polypharmacy in the presence of these conditions. This led us to investigate how commonly used multiple‐drug treatments affect AD onset and progression in the App NL‐G‐F mouse model, considering the impact of sex. Our results show that one specific drug combination (metoprolol, simvastatin, aspirin, paracetamol, and citalopram) improved some measures of cognitive performance, decreased locomotion and anxiety‐like behavior, and reduced amyloid plaques in male mice but did not affect these parameters in female mice. Replacing metoprolol and simvastatin with enalapril and atorvastatin eliminated these effects in male mice. In female mice, the substituted combination reduced anxiety‐like behavior but impaired memory performance. Sex differences were evident not only with drug combinations but also with monotherapies, and may be attributed to factors such as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including sex‐specific drug interactions, hormonal effects on the brain, variations in receptor distribution, gene expression, metabolic pathways, and ultimately, disease pathophysiology. As reported in WT mice, Combination 1 and citalopram alone impacted functional and emotional domains, predominantly in male mice. In female mice, citalopram alone did not affect the OF, EPM, and FST tests. This could be attributed to hormonal fluctuations, which can modulate serotonin receptors. Estrogen affects the density and function of serotonin receptors, such as 5‐ HT1A and 5‐HT2A subtypes, which are key targets of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (like citalopram). As a result, variations in estrogen levels can lead to differential responses to antidepressant treatments between male and female mice. In addition, the expression of serotonin receptor subtypes 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT2A varies between male and female mice. These considerations highlight the importance of considering hormonal influences when evaluating therapeutic responses in women. Combination 2 (including citalopram, but not metoprolol) showed minor effects on locomotion. β‐Blockers such as metoprolol can decrease physical activity when given in combinations, likely related to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. This may account for the lack of effects in Combination 2, where metoprolol was absent. Metoprolol monotherapy improved cognition in male mice with no effect on locomotion, consistent with a previous study in WT aged male mice, while having no effect on cognition and improving locomotion in female mice. The pharmacokinetic interaction, whereby citalopram can increase the concentration of metoprolol, may partly explain these differences. Anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behavior was positively affected by polypharmacy Combination 2, predominantly in female mice. Blocking the renin‐angiotensin system components can reduce anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors in rodents. Thus the presence of enalapril in Combination 2 might contribute to the differential effects shown on anxiety and depression tasks by this specific multiple‐drug diet, which were less evident in Combination 1. Differences in the metabolism of ACE inhibitors, driven by sex‐specific enzyme regulation, may explain our findings in female mice.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^111Qj7Zt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (eg, on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

Limitation of Use

Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed combination represents the dose titrated to the individual patient's needs, therapy with the fixed combination may be more convenient than with the separate components.

Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is the combination tablet of metoprolol tartrate, a beta adrenoceptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic, indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Effect of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on heart rate in healthy young men [^111Wuq1Q]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

During an investigation of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors with metoprolol, we observed that rofecoxib caused a significant reduction in heart rate in young healthy volunteers. The effect of valdecoxib did not reach significance. When these drugs were given together with metoprolol, the effect was continued. The latter effect could not be related to pharmacokinetic interactions. In the light of experimental results claiming a cardioprotective effect of possibly COX-2-derived prostaglandins and clinical observations hinting at an increased risk of sudden cardiovascular death in conjunction with the long-term use of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, our results may help to increase awareness and to suggest investigation of the impact of coxibs on heart function.

Discussion

The patients in this study had many comorbidities. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gout, and myocardial infarction were the most common co-morbid conditions present in the HD patients respectively. Regarding the cause, there are many causes that can lead to the ESRD, for which HD should be initiated. A high number of HD patients in this study had hypertension as a cause of ESRD, followed by diabetes mellitus and polycystic kidney disease. In comparison with other studies, in a study from Thailand and another from Latin America, the most common cause of ESRD was diabetes mellitus.

In this study, the 275 HD patients were prescribed 90 different drugs with a mean (± SD) of 7.87 ± 2.44. The number of medications in this study is close to a Japanese study where the mean was around 7.2 medications. However, this result is lower than a study in Malaysia that included ESRD patients where the mean was around 9 medications. Also, this is lower than a study from the USA where the mean of medications prescribed for HD patient reached 12.3 ± 0.5 medications. In summary, polypharmacy is very common in ESRD patients.

The most commonly prescribed medications in current study were calcium carbonate, followed by alfacalcidol, iron/folic acid, aspirin and amlodipine. When compared with a study conducted at a nephrology unit in a Malaysian hospital, the top five used medications were calcium carbonate (which was the most commonly prescribed medication also), followed by a combination of folic acid and vitamin B complex, and the third commonly prescribed medication was metoprolol followed by lovastatin and ferrous sulfate. Another cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in nephrology department of a government hospital in India, the five most commonly prescribed drugs were multivitamins, iron, folic acid, calcium carbonate, and calcitriol. Due to this poly-pharmacy, HD patients are at higher risk for drug related problems including DDIs.

### Does aspirin attenuate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension or heart failure? [^116SZ45u]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

There is a wealth of data that suggests an important interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic stable cardiovascular disease. The interaction is less obvious in the postinfarction setting, possibly reflecting the fact that many patients stop their aspirin therapy within a few months of such an event. An interaction is biologically plausible, because there is considerable evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert important effects through increasing the production of vasodilator prostaglandins, whereas aspirin blocks their production through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, even at low doses. There is some evidence that low-dose aspirin may raise systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There is also considerable evidence that aspirin may entirely neutralize the clinical benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In addition, aspirin may have an adverse effect on outcome in patients with heart failure that is independent of any interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, possibly by blocking endogenous vasodilator prostaglandin production and enhancing the vasoconstrictor potential of endothelin. The evidence is not sufficient to justify advising long-term aspirin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease in general, and for those with heart failure in particular. Thus, the lack of evidence of benefit with aspirin in patients with heart failure and coronary disease, along with growing evidence that aspirin is directly harmful in patients with heart failure and that aspirin may negate the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suggest that, unless there is an opportunity to randomize the patient into a study of antithrombotic strategies, then aspirin should be withdrawn or possibly substituted with an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet agent that does not block cyclooxygenase. In contrast, there is fairly robust evidence for a benefit of both aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during the first 5 weeks after a myocardial infarction, with little evidence of an interaction. The combination of aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is warranted during this period, after which discontinuation or substitution of aspirin with another agent should be considered.

### A comparative study of oral acetylsalicyclic acid and metoprolol for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. A randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group phase III study [^116Gc1Bi]. Cephalalgia (2001). Low credibility.

This study was a multinational, multicentre, double-blind, active controlled phase III trial designed to investigate efficacy and safety of 300 mg acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA) (n = 135) vs. 200 mg metoprolol (n = 135) in the prophylaxis of migraine. In total 270 (51 male and 219 female) patients, aged 18–65 years, suffering between two and six migraine attacks per month were recruited. The main objective was to show equivalence with respect to efficacy, defined as a 50% reduction in the rate of migraine attacks. A run-in phase was carried out with placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 16-week drug phase. In both treatment groups the median frequency of migraine attacks improved during the study period, from three to two in the ASA group and from three to one in the metoprolol group; 45.2% of all metoprolol patients were responders compared with 29.6% with ASA. Medication-related adverse events were less frequent in the ASA group (37) than in the metoprolol group (73). The findings from this trial show that metoprolol is superior to ASA for migraine prophylaxis but has more side-effects. Acetylsalicylic acid is better tolerated than metoprolol. Using a strict responder criterion ASA showed a responder rate comparable with the placebo rate in the literature.

### Oxaprozin (daypro) [^113HHPTV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interaction Studies

ACE inhibitors (enalapril): Oxaprozin has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril (significant decrease in dose-adjusted AUC0–24and Cmax) and its active metabolite enalaprilat (significant increase in dose-adjusted AUC0–24) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Aspirin: When oxaprozin was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of oxaprozin was reduced, although the clearance of free oxaprozin was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. An in vitro study showed that oxaprozin significantly interfered with the anti-platelet activity of aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Beta-blockers (metoprolol): Subjects receiving 1200 mg DAYPRO once daily with 100 mg metoprolol twice daily exhibited statistically significant but transient increases in sitting and standing blood pressures after 14 days [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Glyburide: Oxaprozin altered the pharmacokinetics of glyburide; however, coadministration of oxaprozin to type II non-insulin dependent diabetic patients did not affect the area under the glucose concentration curve nor the magnitude or duration of control [see Drug Interactions (7)].

H -receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine): The total clearance of oxaprozin was reduced by 20% in subjects who concurrently received therapeutic doses of cimetidine or ranitidine; no other pharmacokinetic parameter was affected. A change of clearance of this magnitude lies within the range of normal variation and is unlikely to produce a clinically detectable difference in the outcome of therapy.

Lithium: Oxaprozin has produced an elevation in plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20% [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Methotrexate: Coadministration of oxaprozin with methotrexate resulted in approximately 36% reduction in apparent oral clearance of methotrexate [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Other drugs: The coadministration of oxaprozin and antacids, acetaminophen, or conjugated estrogens resulted in no statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters in single- and/or multiple-dose studies. The interaction of oxaprozin with cardiac glycosides has not been studied.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

Polypharmacy is common among older adults and people with dementia. Multi‐medication therapy poses risks of harm but also targets comorbidities and risk factors associated with dementia, offering therapeutic potential.

METHODS

We evaluated the effects of two polypharmacy regimens and monotherapies on male and female App NL‐G‐F knock‐in mice. We assessed functional, emotional, and cognitive outcomes; amyloid pathology; and serum metabolomics profiles.

RESULTS

A combination of metoprolol, simvastatin, aspirin, paracetamol, and citalopram improved memory, reduced amyloid burden and neuroinflammation, and modulated AD‐associated metabolomic signatures in male mice, with negligible effects in female mice. Substituting two cardiovascular drugs impacted emotional domains but worsened memory, predominantly in female mice. In males, monotherapies could not explain the combination effects, suggesting drug synergy, whereas in female mice, certain monotherapy effects were lost when combined.

DISCUSSION

This study uncovers the sex‐specific effects of polypharmacy in an AD model, identifying mechanisms and biomarkers that can guide gender‐specific use of medicines in dementia prevention and management.

Highlights

Two polypharmacy combinations show sex‐specific effects on AD pathology and serum metabolomic profiles.
Metoprolol+simvastatin+aspirin+paracetamol+citalopram improves memory and amyloid pathology in male mice.
Replacing metoprolol and simvastatin with enalapril and atorvastatin eliminates benefits in male mice and impairs memory in female mice.
Selected monotherapies produce sex‐specific effects but only partially explain the outcomes of the combinations.
Metabolomic pathways in serum indicate possible mechanisms and biomarkers for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of personalized therapies in aging and dementia.

### Using medications appropriately in older adults [^1159uvNL]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Older Americans comprise 13 percent of the population, but they consume an average of 30 percent of all prescription drugs. Every day, physicians are faced with issues surrounding appropriate prescribing to older patients. Polypharmacy, use of supplements, adherence issues, and the potential for adverse drug events all pose challenges to effective prescribing. Knowledge of the interplay between aging physiology, chronic diseases, and drugs will help the physician avoid potential adverse drug events as well as drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Evidence is now available showing that older patients may be underprescribed useful drugs, including aspirin for secondary prevention in high-risk patients, beta blockers following myocardial infarction, and warfarin for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. There is also evidence that many older adults receive medications that could potentially cause more harm than good. Finding the right balance between too few and too many drugs will help ensure increased longevity, improved overall health, and enhanced functioning and quality of life for the aging population.

### Low-dose aspirin does not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy [^115piEzn]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It has been reported that aspirin (ASA) may interfere with the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of various antihypertensive agents and attenuate the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure.

Methods and Results

Data from the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study, in which 18 790 intensively treated hypertensive patients were randomized to either ASA 75 mg daily or placebo for 3.8 years (with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular events and a 36% reduction in myocardial infarction in ASA-treated patients), were reanalysed for the whole group of patients and for various subgroups with particular attention to the possible effects of ASA on BP and renal function. In ASA-treated and placebo-treated patients: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values achieved with antihypertensive treatment were superimposable, with clinically irrelevant differences; (2) these superimposable SBP and DBP were achieved with antihypertensive therapies, that were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, and (3) changes in serum creatinine and in estimated creatinine clearance and the number of patients developing renal dysfunction were also similar. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits of ASA were of the same magnitude in hypertensive patients receiving or not receiving ACE-inhibitors.

Conclusions

Even long-term, low-dose ASA does not interfere with the BP-lowering effect of antihypertensive agents, including combinations with ACE inhibitors, or with renal function. No negative interaction occurs between ACE inhibition and the cardiovascular benefits of small dose of ASA. Our conclusions cannot be extended to larger doses of ASA, or to patients with congestive heart failure.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^115uP7p5]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this study. First, we did not take into consideration the doses of the medications that were involved in the MDIs. It is possible that patients were prescribed lower doses of a particular medication than recommended because a second or third drug could influence its metabolism, thus mitigating any potentially amplifying interaction. Second, we cannot say if the medications on the list were intended for daily use or only intermittent use, as needed. Aspirin, which appeared on many lists of patients with MDIs, could have been intended to be taken daily for cardioprotective effects or only as necessary for intermittent pain. Daily aspirin would pose greater risk of an ADE, such as gastric hemorrhage, than if taken only intermittently. Third, identification of three and four MDIs is based on the drug-drug interaction tables at our institution. The identification and rating of various interactions might differ across institutions given that there is significant variability in the drug-drug interaction databases.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112VHLZY]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement — drug-drug interaction (DDI) definitions and clinical impact are outlined, noting that a DDI is "a pharmacokinetic or pharmacological influence of 1 medication on another that differs from the known or anticipated effects of each agent alone", with pharmacokinetic DDIs altering "absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion" and pharmacodynamic DDIs occurring when one medication modifies another's effect "in an additive, a synergistic, or an antagonistic fashion"; it is estimated that ≈2.8% of hospital admissions occur as a direct result of DDIs, the clinical impact can range "from mild to life-threatening", and "not all DDIs require a modification in therapy", because significance depends on "both medication-specific and patient-specific factors"; clinically significant DDIs "are usually preventable", underscoring the need to understand "the mechanisms, magnitude, and potential consequences" of any given DDI.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^1144as1W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Colesevelam hydrochloride is a hydrophilic, water-insoluble polymer that is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed.

Distribution

Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed, and therefore, its distribution is limited to the gastrointestinal tract.

Elimination

Metabolism

Colesevelam hydrochloride is not metabolized systemically and does not interfere with systemic drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450.

Excretion

In 16 healthy volunteers, an average of 0.05% of administered radioactivity from a single14C-labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine.

Drug Interaction Studies

Drug interactions between colesevelam and concomitantly administered drugs were screened through in vitro studies and confirmed in in vivo studies. In vitro studies demonstrated that cephalexin, metformin, and ciprofloxacin had negligible binding to colesevelam hydrochloride. Therefore, an in vivo pharmacokinetic interaction of colesevelam hydrochloride with these drugs is unlikely. Colesevelam hydrochloride was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of aspirin, atenolol, digoxin, enalapril, fenofibrate, lovastatin, metoprolol, phenytoin, pioglitazone, quinidine, rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, valproic acid, and warfarin. The results of additional in vivo drug interactions of colesevelam hydrochloride are presented in Table 6.

### Clinically significant drug interactions… [^116G54dV]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

ASPIRIN Coadministration of acetylsalicylic acid and warfarin increases the risk of bleeding. The mechanisms of this adverse interaction are antiplatelet effects, gastric mucosal damage and a hypothrombinemic response to warfarin. Although concomitant use of warfarin and aspirin generally should be avoided, certain patients may benefit from this therapy. One study of patients at high risk for thromboembolic events demonstrated that the increased risk of bleeding with combined warfarin and aspirin therapy was outweighed by the benefit in decreased thromboembolic events. 7 The patients in this study received aspirin in a dosage of 100 mg per day and maintained an INR of 2. 5 to 3.
5.

Concomitant use of statins and erythromycin, itraconazole, niacin or gemfibrozil can cause toxicity that manifests as elevated serum transaminase levels, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. 19 Used alone, any statin can cause these adverse effects. However, the risk of toxicity increases when statins are coadministered with certain drugs. Because this risk may be dose-dependent, the dosage should be limited to the equivalent of 20 mg of lovastatin per day when any statin is given in combination with an interacting drug.
20. NONSELECTIVE MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS The concomitant use of fluoxetine and non-selective MAO inhibitors has resulted in the serotonin syndrome, which is characterized by anxiety, agitation, confusion, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, diaphoresis and hyperthermia. Several cases of serious or fatal reactions have occurred when tranylcypromine was used with fluoxetine.

TRAMADOL Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic with two modes of action: weak binding to the μ-opiate receptor and inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. Reports of serotonin syndrome in association with tramadol and SSRI coadministration appear in the literature. 27 Because depression and chronic pain syndromes frequently coexist, physicians are likely to encounter situations in which this combination is used.

### Interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: should they be used together in older adults with heart failure? [^111hmWar]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether the prostacyclin-inhibiting properties of aspirin counteracts the bradykinin-induced prostacyclin-stimulating effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thereby attenuating the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients.

Background

Most heart failure patients are older adults. Heart failure is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis of older Americans. The renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, and ACE inhibitors play a pivotal role in the management of heart failure. Large-scale double-blind randomized trials have demonstrated the survival benefits of using ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In addition to inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors also decrease the breakdown of bradykinin. Bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, acts by stimulating formation of vasodilatory prostaglandins such as prostacyclin, whereas aspirin or acetyl salicylic acid inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which in turn decreases the production of the prostaglandins. Coronary artery disease and hypertension are the two major underlying causes of heart failure. Most heart failure patients are also on aspirin. There is evidence that aspirin at a daily dose of 80 to 100 mg prevents the synthesis of thromboxane A2 by platelets while relatively sparing the synthesis of prostacyclin in the vascular endothelium. Aspirin at a daily dose of 325 mg has significant inhibitory effects on the vasodilatory prostacyclin synthesis. Studies have demonstrated that, in heart failure patients, low-dose aspirin has no adverse effect on hemodynamic, neurohumoral, or renal functions. Whether the prostacyclin-inhibiting effects of aspirin attenuate some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors mediated by prostacyclin stimulation in heart failure patients is currently unknown.

Methods

Data from large clinical trials investigating the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors were analyzed to determine the effect of aspirin on the vasodilatory actions of ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients, and the results were analyzed on the basis of theoretical and laboratory findings. The studies included are the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) (N = 6,797), the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) (N = 6,090), the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS) (N = 296), and another study involving 317 subjects. The data from these clinical trials investigating the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors included 13,470 subjects. Most of the subjects received aspirin. In the SOLVD study, subjects received aspirin or dipyridamole. Subjects were followed up for an average of about 6 years.

Results

In the SOLVD study, subjects were followed up for 41.1 months in the treatment trial and 37.4 months in the prevention trial. Patients who received aspirin or dipyridamole at baseline did not receive the survival benefits of enalapril, whereas patients who received enalapril did not receive the survival benefits of aspirin. In a rather small study of 317 subjects with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 35%) who were followed up for a relatively longer period of time (5.7 years), the favorable long-term prognosis of patients receiving aspirin was independent of receipt of an ACE inhibitor. A retrospective subgroup analysis of data from the CONSENSUS II study demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) who received enalapril and aspirin was higher than the combined mortality rates of patients receiving enalapril or aspirin alone. This strong interaction between aspirin and the ACE inhibitor enalapril suggests that the survival benefit of enalapril was significantly lower in patients also taking aspirin than in those taking enalapril alone. This interaction was not associated with other nonfatal major events. In the CATS study, use of low-dose aspirin (80 or 100 mg) did not attenuate beneficial effects of captopril (immediate and 1-year follow up) after acute MI.

Conclusion

There is a theoretical possibility that the negative interaction between ACE inhibitors and aspirin may reduce the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure, but the information obtained from the existing databases is limited by the retrospective nature of the analyses and does not establish the association definitively. Double-blind randomized controlled trials should be conducted to determine whether such a negative interaction indeed exists.

### Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and drug-drug-gene interactions following a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: analysis of a multicentre observational study [^113YFiqF]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The age-adjusted CHD death rate is falling in the developed world leading to a higher proportion of individuals living with CHD; approximately half of this decrease is attributable to improvements in interventional and pharmacological strategies, and the other half to attenuation of risk factors. Additionally, the management of multiple other conditions has improved. Thus, the number of CHD patients with multimorbidity, often defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic diseases, is increasing.

Multimorbidity increases the prevalence of polypharmacy, which some have defined as five or more medications daily. Polypharmacy however can be appropriate; for instance, after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), guidelines generally recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor), a high intensity statin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a beta blocker. However, multimorbidity often further increases the number of concomitant drugs due to treatment of related conditions, such as ACS risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and sequelae (e.g. heart failure), and treatment of other co-existing diseases. As the number of co-prescribed medications rises, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and adverse drug reactions increases.

### Aspirin impairs reverse myocardial remodeling in patients with heart failure treated with β-blockers [^1142kLgq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We hypothesized that aspirin (ASA) might alter the beneficial effect of beta-blockers on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.

Background

Aspirin blunts the vasodilation caused by both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients and in patients with heart failure. Several studies suggest that ASA also blunts some of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality in patients with heart failure. To our knowledge, there have been no data evaluating the possible interaction of ASA and beta-blockers on left ventricular remodeling in patients with heart failure.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated patients entered into the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart failure Assessment (MOCHA) trial, a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-response evaluation of carvedilol in patients with chronic stable symptomatic heart failure. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if aspirin independently influenced the improvement in LVEF.

Results

Over all randomized patients (n = 293), LVEF improved 8.2 ± 0.8 ejection fraction (EF) units in ASA nonusers and 4.5 ± 0.7 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.005). In subjects randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 231), LVEF improved 9.5 ± 0.9 EF units in ASA nonusers and 5.8 ± 0.8 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.02). In subjects randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 62), LVEF improved 2.8 ± 1.2 EF units in ASA nonusers and 0.5 ± 1.4 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.20). Aspirin did not significantly affect the heart rate or systolic blood pressure response in either the placebo or carvedilol groups. The effect of ASA became more significant on multivariate analysis. The change in LVEF was also influenced by carvedilol dose, etiology of heart failure, baseline heart rate, EF and coumadin use. The detrimental effect of ASA on the improvement in LVEF was dose-related and was present in both placebo and carvedilol groups, although the effect was statistically significant only in the much larger carvedilol group.

Conclusions

Aspirin significantly affects the changes in LVEF over time in patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction treated with carvedilol. The specific mechanism(s) underlying this interaction are unknown and further studies are needed to provide additional understanding of the molecular basis of factors influencing reverse remodeling in patients with heart failure.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^114SF5bp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers: Metoprolol Extended Release, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown benefits in HFrEF. Similar to above, their role in HFpEF is limited to treating underlying conditions (eg, atrial arrhythmias). 30

Digoxin: The use of digoxin for chronic heart failure has declined as benefits appear to be limited to symptomatic relief without mortality benefit. Furthermore, appropriate management is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL) and older adults in particular are at risk for digoxin toxicity secondary to declining renal drug clearance. In this case it is imperative that renal function be monitored frequently to minimize drug accumulation. Prior to initiating digoxin in older adults, optimization of first‐line guideline‐directed medical therapy should be performed. Discontinuation of digoxin should be considered but requires monitoring for signs of worsening symptoms as stopping therapy may be associated with poorer outcomes among patients with heart failure. 41

On‐going goals of care discussions are paramount as patients' heart failure progresses towards advanced stages. Quality of life can be greatly improved by simplification of the medical regimen. Review and assess the tolerability of recommended therapies and eliminate adjuvant agents that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms (sotalol, dronedarone, propafenone, verapamil, diltiazem, cilostazol, metformin, thiazolidinediones, NSAIDs, etc). 42

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116Wg1uK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^112FctRa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a targeted comparative safety analysis of the potential drug-drug interaction between verapamil or diltiazem and DOACs using an active comparator study design to reduce the residual confounding present in existing real-world studies. An ideal active comparator should be either of the same medication class or be used for similar purposes as the reference product. Therefore, we selected 2 different comparators: amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensive drug, and metoprolol, a β-blocker antihypertensive that is also recommended for heart rate control in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. These 2 drugs are not classified as P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors and provide similar pharmacologic pathways and therapeutic uses compared with verapamil and diltiazem. We aimed to compare the risk of major, moderate, and minor adverse bleeding events among patients with concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs concomitant use of DOACs and amlodipine or metoprolol.

### Phendimetrazine tartrate [^1161bRGu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

Caution is to be exercised in prescribing phendimetrazine for patients with even mild hypertension.

Insulin requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of phendimetrazine tartrate and the concomitant dietary regimen.

Phendimetrazine tartrate may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

Only yellow tablet contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

Drug Interactions:

Efficacy of phendimetrazine tartrate with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Studies with Phendimetrazine Tartrate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C:

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phendimetrazine tartrate. It is also not known whether phendimetrazine tartrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.

Usage in Pregnancy:

Safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Until more information is available, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are or may become pregnant unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.

Nursing Mothers:

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are nursing unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Atenolol (Tenormin) [^111HijKh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with TENORMIN plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.

Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with TENORMIN (see WARNINGS).

Disopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta-blockers.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta-blockers.

Beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.

Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e. TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta-blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting.

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.

Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^111uQcMe]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease

Although beta-blockers were associated with reduction in mortality in trials before routine reperfusion, the reduction in MI was offset by an increased risk of heart failure. Although MI was a relatively rare event (absolute event rate ~ 0.01%) and heart failure was more common (absolute event rate ~ 13%), the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an MI was 118 compared with the number needed to harm (NNH) of 127 to cause an incident heart failure event. Additionally, before routine reperfusion, the event rate for mortality was 7.8% in control versus 6.7% with beta-blockers (NNT 89). There were less tangible benefits in trials with routine reperfusion where the majority of patients received reperfusion with either thrombolytics or coronary intervention. In the International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) trial in 1986, atenolol significantly reduced vascular death, but only 5% of patients were on antiplatelet agents. In contrast, in the large Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial (COMMIT) published in 2005, metoprolol failed to reduce mortality where all patients were on aspirin, 50% on dual antiplatelet agents and 66% received thrombolysis. The combination of antiplatelet agents with prompt reperfusion therapy in the modern era may restrict the extent of myocardial damage in patients with MI and hence limit the substrate which can benefit from sympathetic inhibition and reduced myocardial oxygen demand.

The balance of benefit versus risk is particularly relevant in acute MI where negative inotropy can lead to cardiogenic shock. This may be more pertinent in larger ST-elevation MI, where early high-dose beta-blockade was associated with increased mortality. In lower-risk unstable angina patients, beta-blockers reduce the risk of progression to acute MI. Treatment duration may be an important factor to achieve longer-term benefit, but no RCTs directly investigated this issue. The prognostic effects of beta-blockers in chronic stable ischaemic heart disease and stable angina without prior MI remain unanswered. These issues all have important relevance for future guidelines, particularly whether historical data should be used to support contemporary recommendations.

Chronic coronary disease — antihypertensive pharmacotherapy selection emphasizes comparative outcomes and first-line agents. In the Verapamil SR(Trandolapril Study) trial, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta‑blocker/thiazide diuretic therapy had similar cardiovascular morbidity and death outcomes. In patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD), ACE inhibitor therapy produced a 20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular death (CVD death), myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac arrest compared with placebo. Because of these benefits, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) "are recommended as a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension in such individuals", and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) beta blockers include carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Outcomes with atenolol appear inferior to other antihypertensive drugs, and when beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARB therapies do not sufficiently control blood pressure, additional GDMT therapies can be added, including thiazide diuretics, CCB, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Clinical evidence of dose-dependent interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [^112X8fgG]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Since coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases are the most common serious complications of long standing hypertension, there is a great potential for combining treatment with aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). However, the data regarding interaction of aspirin and ACE-I in relation to blood pressure control and survival benefits are controversial and inconclusive. We presumed that the appearance of dry cough in some of the patients following initiation of ACE-I treatment could be used as a marker for the presence of their influence, whereas ACE-I cough attenuation after addition of aspirin to treatment could be a sign of aspirin and ACE-I interaction on clinical level. The present study was aimed to use ACE-I induced cough as a clinical marker of ACE-I activity to determine whether dose-dependent aspirin and ACE-I interaction does exist. In a cohort of 750 consecutive ACE-I treated hypertensive and postinfarction outpatients we identified 78 (10.4%) non-smoking ACE-I related coughers. Out of them, 31 (21 men, 10 women; mean age 61 ± 0.9 years) agreed to take part in the study, which was aimed to compare two regimens of combined ACE-I and aspirin treatment (self-matched control data): intermediate (500 mg daily) vs low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily). On each visit the life quality, cough severity (CS, 0–4) and frequency (CF, 0–10) scores were registered. Low doses of aspirin demonstrated an excellent safety profile and did not influence any life quality score and ACE-I induced cough. In contrast, intermediate doses completely abolished cough in 17 patients and reduced coughing in other 11 patients. Cough severity and cough frequency scores decreased, respectively, from 2.7 ± 1.1 to 0.7 ± 1.2 (P < 0.001) and from 7.1 ± 2.3 to 2.0 ± 2.2 (P < 0.0001). Overall, the cough frequency score method alone could identify a clear modification of cough in 26 (84%) patients, and cough severity score method alone in 24 (77%). Using the combined frequency/severity score method a modification of cough could be identified in 28 (90%) of the patients receiving intermediate dose of aspirin. Aspirin did not influence heart rate and blood pressure control either in hypertensives or in postinfarction patients. We conclude that using ACE-I induced cough as a clinical marker of ACE-I activity demonstrates that an interaction between ACE-I and aspirin at 500 mg/day does exist. We did not find any evidence supporting the presence of a clinically significant interaction between ACE-I and aspirin at 100 mg/day. Thus, combined treatment by low dose aspirin and ACE-I seems to be both safe and useful.

### The effect of metoprolol and aspirin on cardiovascular risk in bereavement: a randomized controlled trial [^117TQq34]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bereavement is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease; however, no reports exist of interventions to reduce risk. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 85 recently bereaved participants, we determined whether β-blocker (metoprolol 25 mg) and aspirin (100 mg) reduce cardiovascular risk markers and anxiety, without adversely affecting bereavement intensity.

Methods

Participants were spouses (n = 73) or parents (n = 12) of deceased from 5 hospitals in Sydney, Australia, 55 females, 30 males, aged 66.1 ± 9.4 years. After assessment within 2 weeks of bereavement, subjects were randomized to 6 weeks of daily treatment or placebo, and the effect evaluated using ANCOVA, adjusted for baseline values (primary analysis).

Results

Participants on metoprolol and aspirin had lower levels of home systolic pressure (P = 0.03), 24-hour average heart rate (P < .001) and anxiety (P = 0.01) platelet response to arachidonic acid (P < .001) and depression symptoms (P = 0.046) than placebo with no difference in standard deviation of NN intervals index (SDNNi), von Willebrand Factor antigen, platelet-granulocyte aggregates or bereavement intensity. No significant adverse safety impact was observed.

Conclusions

In early bereavement, low dose metoprolol and aspirin for 6 weeks reduces physiological and psychological surrogate measures of cardiovascular risk. Although further research is needed, results suggest a potential preventive benefit of this approach during heightened cardiovascular risk associated with early bereavement.

### Phendimetrazine [^114amb6u]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Precautions Section

Caution is to be exercised in prescribing phendimetrazine for patients with even mild hypertension.

Insulin requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of phendimetrazine tartrate and the concomitant dietary regimen.

Phendimetrazine tartrate may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

Only yellow tablet contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

Drug Interactions:

Efficacy of phendimetrazine tartrate with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Studies with Phendimetrazine Tartrate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C:

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phendimetrazine tartrate. It is also not known whether phendimetrazine tartrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.

Usage in Pregnancy:

Safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Until more information is available, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are or may become pregnant unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.

Nursing Mothers:

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are nursing unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Celecoxib inhibits metabolism of cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate metoprolol in humans [^111rkQwd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In vitro data have shown that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates. However, very limited data are available on the influence of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors on the disposition of CYP2D6 substrates in humans. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically relevant CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol.

Methods

An open, randomized, 3-period crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Metoprolol (50 mg) was given in all 3 periods without or after 7 days of pretreatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) or rofecoxib (25 mg daily) to achieve steady-state conditions of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors in periods 2 and 3.

Results

Celecoxib significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of metoprolol from 271 to 414 micro g. h/L (64% ± 57%, P < .001) and by more than 200% in 1 volunteer. The extent of this drug interaction was more pronounced in volunteers with 2 fully functional alleles compared with volunteers with 1 fully functional allele (103% ± 75% versus 36% ± 23%, P < .05). After administration of celecoxib, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol decreased significantly from 474 to 387 micro g. h/L (P < .01). Rofecoxib caused no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Conclusion

We conclude that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol but that rofecoxib does not. Clinically relevant drug interaction may occur between celecoxib and CYP2D6 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index.

### Rhabdomyolysis in association with simvastatin and amiodarone [^111KqLjM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe myopathy associated with concomitant simvastatin and amiodarone therapy.

Case Summary

A 63-year-old white man with underlying insulin-dependent diabetes, recent coronary artery bypass surgery, and postoperative hemiplegia was treated with aspirin, metoprolol, furosemide, nitroglycerin, and simvastatin. Due to recurrent atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone were initiated. Four weeks after starting simvastatin 40 mg/day and 2 weeks after initiating amiodarone 1 g/day for 10 days, then 200 mg/day, he developed diffuse muscle pain with generalized muscular weakness. Laboratory investigations revealed a significant increase of creatine kinase (CK) peaking at 40 392 U/L. Due to a suspected drug interaction of simvastatin with amiodarone, both drugs were stopped. CK normalized over the following 8 days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was probably related to simvastatin.

Discussion

Myopathy is a rare but potentially severe adverse reaction associated with statins. Besides high statin doses, concomitant use of fibrates, defined comorbidities, and concurrent use of inhibitors of cytochrome P450 are important additional risk factors. This is especially relevant if statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 are combined with inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of several different CYP isoenzymes, including CYP3A4.

Conclusions

Avoiding the concomitant use of drugs with the potential to inhibit CYP-dependent metabolism (eg, amiodarone) or elimination of statins may decrease the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Alternatively, if drug therapy with a potent CYP inhibitor is inevitable, choosing a statin without relevant CYP metabolism (eg, pravastatin) should be considered.

### Full prescribing information… [^115VBd15]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Catecholamine depleting drugs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses. The precise mechanism of action of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known.

When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2. 5:

1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged. Distribution About 12% of the drug is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t. i. d.

with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t. i. d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2-to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in persons with diabetes and multiple risk factors [^111tN1CJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The second question is whether concomitant preventive medications may blunt the cardio-protective effect of aspirin. Currently, many patients are intensively treated with beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins. Widespread statin use is the norm in clinical practice. Their role in prevention therapy is still unsettled. Concomitant medications may be tracked as both a history item, as well as, during the study. Lack of consistency on concomitant medications reporting makes it difficult to correlate the data with the primary endpoints of the study. While this issue is clearly important, there is no or little information on concomitant medications in prior aspirin prevention trials.

A further question is whether aspirin may have a margin of benefit in specific populations such as healthy older adultsor in presence of specific comorbid conditions such as diabetes. In addition, some trials have documented sex-specific heterogeneity of treatment effects. Careful analysis of the data does not allow one to draw firm conclusions on these points. Heterogeneity in the predicted outcome risk deserves further investigations.

The most commonly used method of examining whether treatment effects vary in a trial population is to serially divide patients into subgroups based on potentially relevant characteristics. In the current era, the main problem with this conventional approach is that better management of risk factors has lowered the risk of developing disease and disease severity. Hence, the number of patients that must be enrolled in a trial becomes much greater as lower risk patients are included. Thus, subgroup analyses may be underpowered. On the other hand, a randomized trial cannot be done for every subgroup. One approach that can help to counter this problem is to carry out an aspirin prevention study using a register-based cohort data in a case-control or match weighted design. In such type of studies, groups are defined by the outcome. Researchers then look back to ascertain each person's exposure status to aspirin, and to compare the frequency of outcome in the aspirin group with that in the control group. Investigators would correctly address confounding due to concomitant medications and evaluate the potential incremental value of preventing cardiovascular outcomes by using aspirin on the top of these medications.

### Effect of beta blockers in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^113RWkra]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Previous studies have focused on the presence or absence of β blockers and their influence on mortality. Rutten et al found that the benefit on mortality seen with β blockers was preserved in those individuals who were concurrently prescribed two or more pulmonary drugs or who were using inhaled β 2 agonists or antimuscarinics. However, their analysis did not stratify patients according to stepwise treatment regimens, in particular for long acting β agonists and long acting antimuscarinics. We believe this issue is pertinent given the potential for co-prescription of drugs with agonist and antagonist properties with theoretical interactions.

FEV 1 has previously been shown to decline over time. Using a 30 mL/year reduction (as observed in the placebo limb of the UPLIFT study) as our reference, we found no clinically significant decline in mean FEV 1 over time in each treatment group. Within treatment groups, decline in FEV 1 was observed in individual patients, but the percentage of patients showing a decline was consistent among the treatment groups.

In line with previous studies, we found a reduction in all cause mortality among patients with COPD who were taking statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. As expected, our data showed significant mortality reductions with use of cardiovascular drugs (hazard ratios with aspirin 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.88), statins 0.89 (0.81 to 0.97), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 0.79 (0.72 to 0.88) and calcium channel blockers 0.71 (0.64 to 0.78)). These findings show the importance of recognising that patients with COPD have a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

### PPI therapy. the small bowel, low-dose aspirin and PPIs – should we be concerned? [^113mDNpV]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

A new study suggests that co-prescription of low-dose aspirin and PPIs increases the incidence of small-bowel mucosal breaks. Should we be concerned about the potential negative interactions of these drugs? Or is the balance of evidence still substantially tipped towards the need for PPIs to protect against aspirin-induced upper gastrointestinal damage?

2.3 Drug treatments

The selection of drugs included in the multi‐therapy combinations of this study was based on a population study of individuals ≥ 75 years of age in Sweden, which assessed the most commonly prescribed drug classes and compounds used in polypharmacy. Mice from Cohort 1 were administered a control or a multi‐medication diet (Combination 1), which we previously tested in WT mice in our lab. Combination 1 comprises the following drugs: metoprolol (100 mg/kg/day; Sigma‐Aldrich, USA), paracetamol (acetaminophen, 100 mg/kg/day; Sigma‐Aldrich, USA), aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, 20 mg/kg/day; Sigma‐Aldrich, USA), simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day; Selleck Chemicals, USA), and citalopram (10 mg/kg/day; Selleck Chemicals, USA), which belong to the classes of beta‐blockers, analgesics, antithrombotic, lipid‐modifying, and antidepressant agents, respectively. Among cardiovascular drug classes, beta‐blockers are the most used, followed by diuretics and angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Mice from Cohort 2 were fed with a control or a second multi‐medication regimen (Combination 2) where we replaced two compounds from Combination 1: the beta‐blocker (metoprolol) with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg/day; Cayman Chemicals, USA), and simvastatin with atorvastatin (15 mg/kg/day; Cayman Chemicals, USA). Both the fungal simvastatin and synthetic atorvastatin are highly prescribed lipid‐modifying agents in Sweden, with different effects on cognitive decline possibly depending on their different biochemical properties. Mice from Cohort 3 were administered a control diet or a monotherapy regimen from three selected drugs used in combination at the same dosage: metoprolol, simvastatin, or citalopram.

Calcium channel blockers — statin co-prescription context is as follows: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) include dihydropyridines (eg, amlodipine, felodipine) and nondihydropyridines (diltiazem and verapamil), and because of clearly defined cardiovascular benefits, CCBs are often co-prescribed in patients treated with statin therapy.

### Clinical outcomes with β-blockers for myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116rtquQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Debate exists about the efficacy of β-blockers in myocardial infarction and their required duration of usage in contemporary practice.

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL search for randomized trials evaluating β-blockers in myocardial infarction enrolling at least 100 patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was performed stratifying trials into reperfusion-era (> 50% undergoing reperfusion or receiving aspirin/statin) or pre-reperfusion-era trials.

Results

Sixty trials with 102,003 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the acute myocardial infarction trials, a significant interaction (Pinteraction = .02) was noted such that β-blockers reduced mortality in the pre-reperfusion (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.94) but not in the reperfusion era (IRR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.05). In the pre-reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced cardiovascular mortality (IRR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), myocardial infarction (IRR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97), and angina (IRR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.95), with no difference for other outcomes. In the reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced myocardial infarction (IRR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.83) (number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB] = 209) and angina (IRR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98) (NNTB = 26) at the expense of increase in heart failure (IRR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16) (number needed to treat to harm [NNTH] = 79), cardiogenic shock (IRR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18–1.41) (NNTH = 90), and drug discontinuation (IRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.55–1.73), with no benefit for other outcomes. Benefits for recurrent myocardial infarction and angina in the reperfusion era appeared to be short term (30 days).

Conclusions

In contemporary practice of treatment of myocardial infarction, β-blockers have no mortality benefit but reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and angina (short-term) at the expense of increase in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation. The guideline authors should reconsider the strength of recommendations for β-blockers post myocardial infarction.

### Oxycodone and aspirin [^114VQVvD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug/Drug Interactions with Aspirin

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: The hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway.

Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.

Anticoagulant Therapy (Heparin and Warfarin): Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of drug-drug interactions and the effect on platelets. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk.

Anticonvulsants: Salicylate can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.

Beta Blockers: The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow, and salt and fluid retention.

Diuretics: The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention.

Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the serious side and toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduced renal clearance.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's): The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAID's should be avoided because this may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Aspirin may enhance the serious side effects and toxicity of ketorolac, due to displacement from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduced renal clearance.

Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia.

Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (isoptin SR) [^1178xy1D]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

Cytochrome inducers/inhibitors: In vitro metabolic studies indicate that verapamil is metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C18. Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. erythromycin, ritonavir) causing elevation of plasma levels of verapamil while inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin) have caused a lowering of plasma levels of verapamil, therefore, patients should be monitored for drug interactions.

Aspirin: In a few reported cases, coadministration of verapamil with aspirin has led to increased bleeding time greater than observed with aspirin alone.

Grapefruit juice: The intake of grapefruit juice may increase drug levels of verapamil.

Beta Blockers: Concomitant therapy with beta-adrenergic blockers and verapamil may result in additive negative effects on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction, and/or cardiac contractility. The combination of sustained-release verapamil and beta-adrenergic blocking agents has not been studied. However, there have been reports of excessive bradycardia and AV block, including complete heart block, when the combination has been used for the treatment of hypertension. For hypertensive patients, the risks of combined therapy may outweigh the potential benefits. The combination should be used only with caution and close monitoring.

Asymptomatic bradycardia (36 beats/min) with a wandering atrial pacemaker has been observed in a patient receiving concomitant timolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) eyedrops and oral verapamil.

### Metoprolol CR / XL in postmyocardial infarction patients with chronic heart failure: experiences from MERIT-HF [^112YPg63]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of beta-blockers post-myocardial infarction (MI) was established in the late 1970s. Major advances in the treatment of MI have since occurred. However, patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) were excluded from those trials. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of beta-blockers in post-MI patients with CHF receiving contemporary management.

Methods

This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial: the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF). Patients with CHF in New York Heart Association class II to IV with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 0.40 and a history of being hospitalized for an acute MI (n = 1926) were randomized to metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) versus placebo. Mean EF was 0.28, and the mean follow-up was 1 year.

Results

Metoprolol CR/XL reduced total mortality by 40% (95% CI 0.20–0.55, P = 0.0004), and sudden death by 50% (95% CI 0.26–0.66, P = 0.0004). The combined end point of all-cause mortality/hospitalization for worsening CHF was reduced by 31% (95% CI 0.16–0.44, P < .0001), and cardiac death/nonfatal acute MI by 45% (95% CI 0.26–0.58, P < .0001). A post-hoc analysis showed that the outcome in patients with earlier revascularization (44%) and outcome in those with more severe CHF (20%) was similar to the entire post-MI population.

Conclusions

In post-MI patients with symptomatic CHF, beta-blockade continues to exert a profound reduction in mortality and morbidity in the presence of contemporary management that includes early and late revascularization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and statins.

### Efficacy and safety of angiotensin receptor blockade are not modified by aspirin in patients with chronic heart failure: a cohort study from the candesartan in heart failure – assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme [^114qQM62]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

It is unknown whether there is an interaction between aspirin and angiotensin receptor blockers on outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

The efficacy and safety of candesartan vs. placebo was assessed in 7599 patients with symptomatic HF and reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction enrolled in the CHARM programme according to baseline aspirin use. Patients were randomized to candesartan or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 38 months. Aspirin was used in 4246 (55.9%) of patients at baseline. When compared with placebo, candesartan use was associated with lower event rates for cardiovascular (CV) death or HF hospitalization (primary outcome) in both the aspirin group (28 vs. 31.9%, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72–0.90) and non-aspirin group (33 vs. 38%, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72–0.91). Baseline aspirin use did not modify the effectiveness of candesartan in reducing the risk of CV death or HF hospitalization in CHARM overall (P = 0.64) or in the CHARM individual trials. In addition, there was no significant interaction between aspirin therapy and candesartan in terms of discontinuation of study drug due to adverse reactions (P = 0.72).

Conclusion

There appears to be no significant modification of the benefit of candesartan on CV mortality and morbidity outcomes or safety by concomitant use of aspirin in patients with chronic HF.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115Sg6kn]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

The Prostacyclin Pathway: Epoprostenol, Iloprost, Treprostinil, and Selexipag

Prostacyclin, or prostaglandin I 2, is a metabolite of endogenous arachidonic acid with potent vasodilator, endothelial cell proliferation inhibition, and anti-platelet aggregation properties. In patients with PAH, the decrease of prostacyclin synthase results in less circulating prostacyclin, or prostaglandin I 2, and causes disruption of vascular homeostasis. The available Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies that target the prostacyclin pathway include three prostacyclin, or prostaglandin I 2, analogs (epoprostenol, iloprost, and treprostinil) and one prostacyclin receptor agonist (selexipag). Epoprostenol and iloprost are not subject to CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions because of the route of administration and metabolism. Epoprostenol is hydrolyzed rapidly at neutral pH in blood and is subject to enzymatic degradation. Iloprost is metabolized primarily via β-oxidation to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite. Concomitant use of antihypertensive agents, diuretics, or vasodilators with prostacyclin agents may lead to increased risk of symptomatic hypotension (Table 4). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), and anticoagulants may increase risk of bleeding because of additive antiplatelet properties.

### Metoprolol tartrate… [^115AXrLx]. FDA (DailyMed) (2015). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Observe patients treated with Metoprolol Tartrate plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol. The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Metoprolol Tartrate: confusional state, an increase in blood triglycerides and a decrease in High Density Lipoprotein. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hypertension and Angina Metoprolol tartrate is contraindicated in sinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure. Hypersensitivity to metoprolol and related derivatives, or to any of the excipients; hypersensitivity to other beta-blockers.

If treatment with atropine is not successful, metoprolol should be discontinued, and cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation of a cardiac pacemaker should be considered. AV Block: Metoprolol slows AV conduction and may produce significant first-, second-, or third-degree heart block. Acute myocardial infarction also produces heart block. If heart block occurs, metoprolol should be discontinued and atropine should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine is not successful, cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation of a cardiac pacemaker should be considered.

### Death temporally related to the use of a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist in cocaine associated myocardial infarction [^112dGA8F]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although it is commonly stated that the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with cocaine toxicity, actual clinical evidence of harm is lacking. This case helps to highlight the risks of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use.

Case Report

A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain after using approximately 1 gram of intranasal cocaine. Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.

Discussion

The administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbates cocaine-induced lethality in animals. In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.

### Effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on platelet aggregation in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the PLATE-BLOCK study [^114xRTsj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Platelet aggregation plays a pivotal role in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In this setting, β-blockers (BBs) are used to counteract the effects of catecholamines on heart. Circulating catecholamines can also potentiate platelet reactivity, mainly through α 2 - and β 2 -adrenoceptors on human platelets' surface, thus BB may affect platelet aggregation; however, the effects of different BBs on platelet aggregation in contemporary-treated patients with ACS have been poorly investigated. One hundred patients with ACS on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor were randomized to receive treatment with carvedilol, a nonselective BB (n = 50), or metoprolol, a selective β 1 -blocker (n = 50), at maximum tolerated dose. Light transmission aggregometry was performed at randomization (T0) and at 30-day follow-up (T30), and the results were expressed as a percentage of maximum platelet aggregation (MPA). The primary end point was epinephrine-induced MPA at 30 days. Patients were predominantly men (80%), and mean age was 57.3 ± 9.7 years. The 2 randomized groups were well balanced for baseline characteristics. At T0, mean MPA was similar between the groups (18.96 ± 9.05 vs 18.32 ± 9.21 with 10µM epinephrine, 14.42 ± 9.43 vs 15.98 ± 10.08 with 20µM adenosine diphophate (ADP), and 13.26 ± 9.83 vs 14.30 ± 9.40 with 10µM ADP for carvedilol and metoprolol, respectively, all p = NS). At 30 days, platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine was significantly lower in the carvedilol group than in the metoprolol group (23.52 ± 10.25 vs 28.72 ± 14.37, p = 0.04), with a trend toward the lower values of ADP-induced MPA (20µM ADP 19.42 ± 13.84 vs 24.16 ± 13.62, p = 0.09; 10µM ADP 19.12 ± 12.40 vs 22.57 ± 13.59, p = 0.19). In conclusion, carvedilol, a nonselective BB, reduces residual platelet reactivity in patients with ACS compared with the selective BB, metoprolol.

### Therapeutic implications of drug interactions with acetaminophen and aspirin… [^115XRMY6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Only drug-drug interactions that are believed clinically important and that are primarily pharmacokinetic in nature are discussed in this article. Drugs reported to interact with aspirin are oral anticoagulants, methotrexate, probenecid, and sulfinpyrazone; those that are believed to interact with acetaminophen are propantheline bromide, narcotics, and metoclopramide hydrochloride, as well as food. Ethyl alcohol, ammonium chloride, antacids, oral antidiabetic agents, corticosteroids, and heparin sodium probably interact with aspirin. Fenoprofen calcium, gold sodium thiomalate, indomethacin, naproxen, penicillin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, and spironolactone may also cause such interactions. Ethyl alcohol, β-adrenergic blockers, oral anticoagulants, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, and miscellaneous mutual toxicities may cause interactions with acetaminophen.

The concomitant use of drugs that are believed to interact importantly with either aspirin or acetaminophen should be avoided when designing a treatment regimen. The remaining agents discussed here demand careful monitoring in difficult clinical situations and must be submitted to further controlled studies. Hayes AH.

### Combination pharmacotherapy to prevent cardiovascular disease: present status and challenges [^1131Smu3]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Combination pills containing aspirin, multiple blood pressure (BP) lowering drugs, and a statin have demonstrated safety, substantial risk factor reductions, and improved medication adherence in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The individual medications in combination pills are already recommended for use together in secondary CVD prevention. Therefore, current information on their pharmacokinetics, impact on the risk factors, and tolerability should be sufficient to persuade regulators and clinicians to use fixed-dose combination pills in high-risk individuals, such as in secondary prevention. Long-term use of these medicines, in a polypill or otherwise, is expected to reduce CVD risk by at least 50–60% in such groups. This risk reduction needs confirmation in prospective randomized trials for populations for whom concomitant use of the medications is not currently recommended (e.g. primary prevention). Given their additive benefits, the combined estimated relative risk reduction (RRR) in CVD from both lifestyle modification and a combination pill is expected to be 70–80%. The first of several barriers to the widespread use of combination therapy in CVD prevention is physician reluctance to use combination pills. This reluctance may originate from the belief that lifestyle modification should take precedence, and that medications should be introduced one drug at a time, instead of regarding combination pills and lifestyle modification as complementary and additive. Second, widespread availability of combination pills is also impeded by the reluctance of large pharmaceutical companies to invest in development of novel co-formulations of generic (or 'mature') drugs. A business model based on 'mass approaches' to drug production, packaging, marketing, and distribution could make the combination pill available at an affordable price, while at the same time providing a viable profit for the manufacturers. A third barrier is regulatory approval for novel multidrug combination pills, as there are few precedents for the approval of combination products with four or more components for CVD. Acceptance of combination therapy in other settings suggests that with concerted efforts by academics, international health agencies, research funding bodies, governments, regulators, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, combination pills for prevention of CVD in those with disease or at high risk (e.g. those with multiple risk factors) can be made available worldwide at affordable prices. It is anticipated that widespread use of combination pills with lifestyle modifications can lead to substantial risk reductions (as much as an 80% estimated RRR) in CVD. Heath care systems need to deploy these strategies widely, effectively, and efficiently. If implemented, these strategies could avoid several millions of fatal and non-fatal CVD events every year worldwide.

### Sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium (Treximet) [^113z6GPc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Gender

In a pooled analysis of 5 pharmacokinetic trials, there was no effect of gender on the systemic exposure of TREXIMET.

Race

The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of TREXIMET has not been studied. The systemic clearance and Cmaxof sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and white (n = 38) healthy male subjects.

Drug Interaction Studies

Aspirin

When naproxen was administered with aspirin (> 1 gram/day), the protein binding of naproxen was reduced, although the clearance of free naproxen was not altered. See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions of naproxen, an NSAID, with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Propranolol

Propranolol 80 mg given twice daily had no significant effect on sumatriptan pharmacokinetics. See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions of propranolol, a beta-blocker, with TREXIMET [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115jiFgY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma non-pharmacological interventions — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse: Always ask about asthma before prescribing NSAIDs, and advise patients to stop using them if asthma worsens. Always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications. Aspirin and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not generally contraindicated unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents. Decide about prescription of oral or ophthalmic beta-blockers on a case-by-case basis. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision by a specialist. If cardioselective beta-blockers are indicated for acute coronary events, asthma is not an absolute contra-indication, but the relative risks/benefits should be considered.

### Methocarbamol and aspirin [^111hpvkc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol.

Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: The hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway.

Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.

Anticoagulant Therapy (Heparin and Warfarin): Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of drug-drug interactions and the effect on platelets. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk.

Anticonvulsants: Salicylate can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.

Beta Blockers: The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow, and salt and fluid retention.

Diuretics: The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention.

Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the serious side and toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduced renal clearance.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's): The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAID's should be avoided because this may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Aspirin may enhance the serious side effects and toxicity of ketorolac, due to displacement from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduced renal clearance.

Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia.

Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) patients without angina — In patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) but without HF or angina, 4 types of interventions have been used to reduce the risk of reinfarction and death, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers, drugs to address dyslipidemia such as statins, antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and coronary revascularization. In patients who have had an MI and who have HF but not angina, the use of ACEIs and beta-blockers can also decrease the risk of reinfarction and death, but it is less clear whether such patients benefit from the use of aspirin or revascularization. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of major ischemic events in patients without HF; however, the role of aspirin in patients with HF has not been established and may attenuate the hemodynamic and survival benefits of ACEIs, making the role of aspirin in preventing ischemic events in patients with chronic HF controversial. Alternative antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel) may not interact adversely with ACEIs and may have superior effects in preventing clinical events, but their ability to favorably affect outcomes in HF has not been demonstrated. Despite these theoretical possibilities, coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve cardiac function or symptoms of HF or to prevent reinfarction or death in patients with HF and no angina.

### Evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions among palestinian hemodialysis patients [^1149aP3X]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs)

Among 275 patients, 245 (89.1%) patients had at least one potential DDI (Fig. 1). Among the 245 patients who had potential interactions, a total of 930 interactions were identified. According to risk rating classification, 676 (72.69%) were C, 172 (18.49%) were B, 78 (8.39%) were D, and 2 (0.22%) for each A and X risk rating.

Fig. 1
The frequency of the number of Potential drug-drug interactions

The most common interaction in 114 (41.5%) patients was calcium carbonate with amlodipine (Calcium salts may diminish the therapeutic effect of Calcium Channel Blockers) followed by aspirin with calcium carbonate in 76 (27.6%) cases (Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Salicylates). Table 1 shows the top ten potential interactions.

Table 1
Top Ten potential drug-drug interactions

Factors associated with potential drug-drug interactions

Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation between age and number of potential interactions (p value = 0.015). The number of potential DDIs that the patients had were also related to the number of chronic diseases and total number of medications (P value < 0.001 for each one). However, there was no significant relationship with gender (p value = 0.725), smoking status (p value = 0.834) and the duration of dialysis (p value = 0.920) (Table 2). The results of multiple linear regression showed a significant positive association between number of potential DDIs with the total number of medications (r = 0.242; p < 0.001). The range of VIF was from 1.067 to 1.206 which indicated absence of multicollinearity between independent variables (Table 3).

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114mogHm]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Aspirin has a relatively simple pharmacokinetics, with no requirement for metabolic activation, ∼50% oral bioavailability, and 15 to 20 min half-life. The drug is rapidly absorbed in the stomach and upper intestine without active transporters, by virtue of its weak acidic properties, and undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver resulting in partial deacetylation of acetylsalicylic acid to salicylic acid. The portal blood represents an important pre-systemic compartment for antiplatelet pharmacodynamics, as platelets are exposed early to approximately two-fold higher aspirin concentrations than in the systemic circulation. Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as C max and T max, depend on the aspirin formulation and influence the rate at which inhibition of platelet TXA 2 production becomes detectable, with enteric-coated formulations requiring up to 4 to 5 h to reach a peak antiplatelet effect. The irreversible mechanism of action and short half-life of aspirin allow a 'hit-and-run' modality of antiplatelet action and limit any extra-platelet effects, thereby reducing vascular and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity vis-à-vis traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs). A simple pharmacokinetics limits the potential for drug–drug interactions. In fact, the only clinically relevant interaction of low-dose aspirin is with some tNSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, which when present in the patient's blood stream may limit access of aspirin to Ser-529, because of higher affinity for a common docking site (arginine-120) within the COX-1 channel (Figure 3). The concomitant administration of ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, paracetamol, or diclofenac, prevents the irreversible platelet inhibition induced by low-dose aspirin and may limit its cardioprotective effects. Moreover, failure to suspect or detect this drug–drug interaction may have been responsible for numerous past reports of the so-called aspirin 'resistance'.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol) [^116UAiGU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

TOPROL-XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

TOPROL-XL may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

TOPROL-XL is indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

TOPROL-XL is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^116VhEhd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature

Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)

Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors

Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin.

Acetazolamide

Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.

Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets

Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk.

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^117DCVJp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

 Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions

- For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7)

- Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7)

- Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)
