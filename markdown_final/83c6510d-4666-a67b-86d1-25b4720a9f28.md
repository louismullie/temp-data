## Question

How to diagnose hypovolemic hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose hypovolemic hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should verify volume status clinically and with urine studies, especially urine sodium. Next, I will consider confounders like diuretics and adrenal insufficiency. After that, I should review adjunctive tests such as urine osmolality, BUN/creatinine ratio, and copeptin. Finally, I will synthesize a diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and special scenarios that can mimic hypovolemia, ensuring I double-check each inference against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the presence of true hypotonic hyponatremia, because management hinges on this. I need to check serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L and then measure serum osmolality to confirm hypotonicity, typically less than 275 mOsm/kg, while excluding hypertonic causes like hyperglycemia and pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia, which would alter the diagnostic pathway entirely [^0632c300] [^90dd948b] [^19dbc176].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical assessment of volume status, since distinguishing hypovolemia from euvolemia is the crux. I should review for orthostatic vitals, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and capillary refill, but I need to remember that these signs have limited sensitivity and specificity and that clinical misclassification is common, so I should not over-rely on exam alone and must integrate laboratory data before concluding hypovolemia [^842a43b7] [^c81b1e34].

> Next, I should review urine sodium, because this is the most informative single test to separate hypovolemic from euvolemic causes. In hypovolemic hyponatremia, the kidney should avidly retain sodium, so urine sodium is typically low, generally less than 20–30 mmol/L, whereas in SIADH urine sodium is often greater than 30 mmol/L. However, I need to ensure I interpret this in context, as diuretics, renal salt wasting, and dietary solute intake can confound this signal, so a single value is not absolute and serial measurements may be needed [^a3af82a4] [^019cee26] [^5962b07d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for confounders that can raise urine sodium despite hypovolemia. Diuretics, particularly thiazides, can cause natriuresis and mimic SIADH, and adrenal insufficiency can present with hyponatremia and high urine sodium, so I need to ask about medication use and consider morning cortisol and ACTH testing when clinically suspected, adjusting my interpretation of urine sodium accordingly [^06c7e275] [^988bcbd3] [^be0f98c6].

> I will now examine urine osmolality to refine the pathophysiology. In hypovolemic hyponatremia, urine osmolality is typically greater than 100 mOsm/kg because vasopressin is appropriately stimulated, whereas very low urine osmolality, around 100 mOsm/kg or less, suggests primary polydipsia or low solute intake; I should confirm this before attributing the hyponatremia to volume depletion alone [^2791a906] [^28477fe5].

> Let me consider adjunctive laboratory clues. A BUN-to-creatinine ratio greater than 20:1 supports prerenal azotemia and hypovolemia, but I should confirm that this is not universal and can be absent in some hypovolemic patients, so I must integrate it with the broader picture rather than use it as a standalone diagnostic test [^03cad679] [^c81b1e34].

> But wait, what if the diagnosis remains uncertain after standard evaluation. In that case, I should review copeptin, a surrogate of vasopressin, recognizing that very high copeptin levels favor hypovolemia or hypervolemic states with reduced effective arterial blood volume, whereas very low levels favor primary polydipsia; however, most patients fall in a mid-range with overlap, so copeptin alone is insufficient and is best used as a ratio with urine sodium or in research contexts rather than routine care [^835b78f1] [^10acfcb1].

> I should confirm the diagnostic synthesis with a practical algorithm. Hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium less than or equal to 30 mmol/L, in the absence of diuretics and with supportive clinical context, supports hypovolemic hyponatremia, whereas urine sodium greater than 30 mmol/L pushes me to consider SIADH, adrenal insufficiency, or diuretic effects; if the presentation is ambiguous, a cautious trial of isotonic saline with close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output can be diagnostic, as hypovolemic patients will typically show a rise in sodium as vasopressin is suppressed, whereas SIADH will not respond as expected [^a3af82a4] [^842a43b7] [^019cee26].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that can masquerade as hypovolemia. Cerebral salt wasting presents with hypovolemia and high urine sodium after neurologic injury, and thiazide-associated hyponatremia can look like SIADH but may be volume responsive; in these cases, I need to ensure I do not mislabel the etiology, because treatment diverges and giving fluids to SIADH can worsen hyponatremia, while failing to replete volume in CSW can perpetuate harm [^783a9f0f] [^be0f98c6] [^842a43b7].

> Let me reconsider the role of a therapeutic trial when the diagnosis is uncertain. A carefully monitored infusion of 0.9% saline at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour with frequent sodium checks can clarify the diagnosis if urine output rises and serum sodium improves, indicating suppression of vasopressin and confirming hypovolemia; conversely, minimal sodium change with continued concentrated urine supports SIADH and should prompt cessation of isotonic fluids and consideration of fluid restriction or other SIADH-directed therapy [^77f9855a] [^842a43b7].

> I need to ensure I document chronicity and symptoms because this affects both diagnostic urgency and treatment safety. Acute hyponatremia under 48 hours carries a higher risk of cerebral edema and may justify hypertonic therapy when severe, whereas chronic hyponatremia increases the risk of osmotic demyelination with rapid correction, so I should plan slower, controlled correction and avoid overcorrection even as I pursue the diagnostic workup [^90dd948b] [^19dbc176].

> In summary, I should double-check that my diagnosis of hypovolemic hyponatremia rests on three pillars: confirmed hypotonic hyponatremia, low urine sodium in the right clinical context, and exclusion of confounders such as diuretics and adrenal insufficiency. When uncertainty persists, a monitored isotonic saline trial can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, but I must monitor sodium closely to avoid overcorrection and adjust the plan as new data emerge [^a3af82a4] [^842a43b7] [^77f9855a].

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is identified by **serum sodium < 135 mmol/L** with **low measured serum osmolality (< 275 mOsm/kg)** [^0632c300] and **low urine sodium (≤ 30 mmol/L)** [^a3af82a4], reflecting sodium and water loss with relatively greater sodium deficit. Clinically, patients show signs of **volume depletion** (orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor) [^c81b1e34] and often have a history of gastrointestinal losses, diuretic use, or adrenal insufficiency [^03cad679]. Urine osmolality is typically **> 100 mOsm/kg** due to appropriate ADH secretion, and the BUN:creatinine ratio is often elevated (> 20:1) [^03cad679]. Differentiate from SIADH (euvolemic, urine sodium > 30 mmol/L) [^019cee26] and hypervolemic hyponatremia (edema, ascites) [^90dd948b]. If uncertain, a cautious trial of isotonic saline can help confirm the diagnosis: sodium rises in hypovolemia but not in SIADH [^842a43b7].

---

## Clinical presentation and history

Patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia typically present with:

- **Neurological symptoms**: Nausea, headache, confusion, lethargy, seizures, and coma, depending on the severity and acuity of hyponatremia [^90dd948b].

- **Volume depletion signs**: Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and concentrated urine [^c81b1e34].

- **History**: Gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea), diuretic use (especially thiazides), adrenal insufficiency, or excessive sweating [^03cad679].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Essential laboratory tests

| **Test** | **Expected findings in hypovolemic hyponatremia** |
|-|-|
| Serum sodium | < 135 mmol/L [^90dd948b] |
| Serum osmolality | < 275 mOsm/kg (hypotonic) [^0632c300] |
| Urine sodium | ≤ 30 mmol/L (indicates sodium conservation) [^a3af82a4] |
| Urine osmolality | > 100 mOsm/kg (concentrated urine due to ADH) [^notfound] |
| BUN:creatinine ratio | > 20:1 (prerenal azotemia) [^notfound] |

---

### Additional tests

- **Serum potassium**: May be low or normal; elevated potassium suggests adrenal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Serum glucose**: To exclude hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia [^03cad679].

- **TSH and cortisol**: To exclude hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency [^6cc59ab8].

---

## Differentiation from other types of hyponatremia

Hypovolemic hyponatremia must be differentiated from euvolemic (SIADH) and hypervolemic (heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) hyponatremia:

| **Parameter** | **Hypovolemic** | **Euvolemic (SIADH)** | **Hypervolemic** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Volume status | Low | Normal | High |
| Urine sodium | ≤ 30 mmol/L | > 30 mmol/L | ≤ 30 mmol/L |
| Urine osmolality | > 100 mOsm/kg | > 100 mOsm/kg | > 100 mOsm/kg |
| Clinical signs | Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes | No edema, normal vital signs | Edema, ascites, pleural effusion |

---

## Diagnostic challenges and pitfalls

- **Clinical assessment of volume status**: Often inaccurate, with low sensitivity and specificity [^842a43b7].

- **Urine sodium interpretation**: Can be confounded by diuretic use, renal salt wasting, or low solute intake [^5962b07d].

- **Overlap with SIADH**: Differentiation can be difficult, especially in chronic or mild cases [^842a43b7].

---

## Confirmatory diagnostic approach

If uncertainty persists, a **therapeutic trial of isotonic saline** can help distinguish hypovolemic hyponatremia from SIADH: sodium rises in hypovolemia but remains unchanged or worsens in SIADH due to continued water retention [^842a43b7].

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

- **Serum sodium**: < 135 mmol/L [^90dd948b].

- **Serum osmolality**: < 275 mOsm/kg [^0632c300].

- **Urine sodium**: ≤ 30 mmol/L [^a3af82a4].

- **Urine osmolality**: > 100 mOsm/kg [^notfound].

- **Clinical signs**: Volume depletion (orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes) [^c81b1e34].

- **History**: Gastrointestinal losses, diuretic use, adrenal insufficiency [^03cad679].

---

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is diagnosed by **confirming hypotonic hyponatremia**, documenting low urine sodium, and identifying clinical volume depletion, while excluding SIADH and hypervolemic states. A structured approach with careful interpretation of urine studies and, when needed, a saline trial ensures accurate diagnosis and guides safe, effective therapy.

### Establishing a bedside diagnosis of hypovolemia… [^c81b1e34]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Various signs, including postural vital signs, capillary refill time, skin turgor and moistness of the axillae, tongue and mucous membranes, may be used in the assessment of patients with suspected hypovolemia. McGee and colleagues conducted a literature review to identify which, if any, signs and symptoms were reliable in the clinical evaluation of volume depletion and dehydration. A MEDLINE search was used to retrieve articles on the bedside diagnosis of hypovolemia. Some studies were of patients with known amounts of blood loss, while others were of patients who presented to emergency departments and were suspected of having hypovolemia as a result of symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and decreased oral intake.

As far as the reliability of postural vital signs in the diagnosis of hypovolemia is concerned, a review of 25 studies of postural vital signs in more than 3, 500 normovolemic persons revealed that a postural pulse increase of 30 per minute or more had a specificity of 96 percent. The authors found that the most helpful physical findings in the evaluation of patients with suspected blood loss were severe postural dizziness and a postural pulse increase of 30 beats per minute or more. Mild postural dizziness had no value in the diagnosis of hypovolemia. Normal capillary refill time ranges from two seconds in children and adult men to three seconds in adult women and four seconds in the elderly. One study revealed that a prolonged refill time does not accurately predict 450 mL of blood loss. This sign was found to have a 6 percent sensitivity and a 93 percent specificity.

The authors conclude that a large increase in the postural pulse or severe postural dizziness is required to diagnose hypovolemia related to blood loss, although these findings are often absent in the setting of moderate blood loss. The literature review indicated that few findings have proven reliability in the diagnosis of hypovolemia related to diarrhea, vomiting and decreased oral intake. Decreased capillary refill time and poor skin turgor have been shown not to be of diagnostic value. Thus, the authors state that physicians should not hesitate to order serum electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine determinations if hypovolemia is suspected.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^e6f1a16b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^cc2b8ddc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

[Na], Serum sodium concentration; +, always; +/–, If clinically indicated/sometimes useful.

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^45c03e3c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Management of hyponatremia [^18e583f0]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prehospital assessment — point-of-care testing and clinical evaluation: Devices and cartridges require a narrow ambient temperature range of 16 to 30°C (61 to 86°F) to ensure functionality. When testing is unavailable, correct field diagnosis is mostly predicated on obtaining an accurate history of total fluid intake, and supportive features include the absence of major signs and symptoms common to symptomatic hypovolemia, weight gain, and that urine output may be an unreliable differentiator. The guideline states, "When available, point-of-care testing should be done on at-risk, symptomatic patients. If unavailable, integrate all available clinical and historical information into an assessment of the patient's hydration status (history of fluid intake, food intake, preexisting signs and symptoms, body weight if available, and urine output). Recommendation grade: 1C".

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^92379137]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry for Patients With Euvolemic and Hypervolemic Hyponatremia (HN Registry) (NCT01240668) is a prospective, observational, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN in the United States (146 sites) and with euvolemic HN in Europe (79 sites). A detailed description of the study design has been published previously, 20 and the results for the overall cohort and the euvolemic cohort have been published. 21 The present analysis focuses on the hypervolemic HF subset of patients with HN in the United States. Hypervolemic patients with cirrhosis were not included in this analysis.

In brief, observational chart data were collected retrospectively by investigators at each site throughout the duration of a patient's hospitalization. No prospective diagnostic or treatment algorithm or protocol was imposed, nor was consecutive enrollment required for entry. Hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible if they had hypervolemic HN characterized by serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) ≤ 130 mEq/L, a current diagnosis of HF documented in the medical record, and hypervolemia as determined by the site investigative team based on medical record review. A cutoff of [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/L was chosen to focus on patients more likely to be receiving therapy specifically for HN. Patients were excluded if they were hypovolemic, had a random blood glucose level > 250 mg/dL, or 180–250 mg/dL together with a [Na +] of 127–130 mEq/L at entry, or received renal replacement therapy while they had HN. Patients were also excluded if they were receiving an investigational drug or device for any reason in a clinical trial setting.

Introduction

Hyponatremia represents a serious health hazard. Hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, women, – and childrenexhibit high frequency and/or severity of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia developing during the course of other morbid conditions increases their severity. – Estimates of direct costs for treating hyponatremia in the United States ranged between $1.61 and $3.6 billion.

Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are universal – and range from subtle (disturbances of balance, problems in cognition detected only during specific testing) to life‐threatening manifestations of increased intracranial pressure with life‐threatening hypoxia – and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Although the treating physicians must make an accurate diagnosis based on well‐established and described clinical criteria, treatment is also guided by the severity of these manifestations. The magnitude and rate of increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na]) during treatment are critical. Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic myelinolysis, – whereas undercorrection may fail to prevent life‐threatening manifestations.

The mainstays of treatment are restricted free water intake and saline infusion, with or without furosemide. There are 2 indications for saline infusion in hyponatremia. Overt manifestations of hyponatremia are treated with hypertonic saline, whereas symptomatic hypovolemia associated with hyponatremia without overt symptoms is usually treated with isotonic saline. – In both situations, the infusion of saline results in rising [Na]. This rise can be slower or faster than desired, with potentially dire clinical consequences.

To achieve the desired rise in [Na], several formulas, most often the Adrogue–Madias formula, are used to calculate volume, rate, and strength of saline infusion. The predictive accuracy of the Adrogue–Madias formula is, in general, good. However, the rise in [Na] exceeds the value predicted by this formula in some instances, particularly in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. –

This report presents the principles of management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. We analyzed factors that cause deviations in the change of [Na] from the predicted values. We present a clinical protocol for managing hyponatremia with saline infusion based on this analysis.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — in-hospital assessment and management: Urgent measurement of blood sodium by the most rapidly available means, assessment for clinical signs suggestive of developing cerebral edema, and obtaining and storing specimens for later analysis of blood serum osmolality and urine sodium and osmolality are advised; provide supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%, restrict fluids until onset of urination, and avoid intravenous normal saline until sodium correction is initiated, though normal saline may be required for hypovolemic shock or in renal protection therapy for rhabdomyolysis; in severe cases, administer intravenous 3% sodium chloride as a 100-mL bolus repeated twice at 10-min intervals aiming to reverse cerebral edema, and aim to increase serum sodium by approximately 4 to 5 mmol·L⁻¹ or until neurological symptoms are reversed by active treatment, then allow remaining correction to occur spontaneously via urinary free water excretion.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^019cee26]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

UNa concentration is a very useful discriminator of ECF volume status. This is because in hypovolemic hyponatremia the mechanisms to conserve sodium remain intact, resulting in low UNa excretion — however, in SIAD there is ongoing renal sodium loss. UNa concentrations can vary considerably, even in serial samples hour to hour, so the exact value is not as useful as whether it is above or below an approximate threshold of 30 mmol/L (according to current European guidelines, or 20–30 mmol/L according the expert panel guidelines). Because of measurement variability and other factors, it is difficult to determine a strict UNa cutoff for diagnosis. Different sources have set the UNa threshold for SIAD diagnosis at varying levels, including greater than 20 mmol/L, greater than 30 mmol/L, greater than 40 mmol/L, or even greater than 50 mmol/L. The original description of SIAD by Bartter and Schwartz referred to "continued renal excretion of sodium" without quantifying a threshold, an approach also taken by some contemporary sources, perhaps to avoid this controversy. Because UNa is a continuous variable under multifactorial influence, setting a higher threshold will increase the specificity of SIAD diagnosis but decrease sensitivity, and vice versa for a lower threshold (Fig. 9). Given this variability, and because volume status can change over time, repeated UNa measurements may be useful. Logically, the closer to the threshold, the greater the value in continued reevaluation. A low UNa may also develop with resolution of transient SIAD as the retained water begins to be excreted, so this finding does not totally rule out SIAD having been present. Clinical history and assessment of urine output are key to differentiating this scenario from hypovolemia.

Figure 9.
Identifying a urine sodium threshold for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) vs hypovolemic hyponatremia: urine sodium concentrations (UNa) in a prospective assessment of 58 patients with plasma sodium concentration less than 130 mmol/L, classified according to response to intravenous 0.9% saline rehydration (gold standard assessment of volume status). This study recommended a threshold of UNa greater than 30 mmol/L to differentiate hypovolemia (saline responders) from SIAD (saline nonresponders). Spot UNa in saline responders and nonresponders. All individual values as well as the mean ± 1 SEM are included. Figure reproduced from Chung 1987 with permission.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of UNa include metabolic alkalosis and dietary solute intake. In the setting of metabolic alkalosis, UNa is not a reliable indicator of volume status (due to excretion of bicarbonate with sodium). In such cases, the urine chloride concentration, which is also typically low in hypovolemia, can be used instead. This assessment assumes normal salt and water intake, as low solute intake can lead to a low UNa even in SIAD — which reduces the specificity for diagnosing hypovolemia as a differential.

It is important to note that hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency and diuretics is usually volume responsive and characterized by a high UNa, hence these are important differentials to consider (discussed later). It has been suggested that calculating fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) is another measure that can assist in diagnosing SIAD, potentially useful in patients on diuretics in whom UNa may be less reliable (see Fig. 2). This is because uric acid is excreted in the proximal tubule and hence is not subject to interference from common diuretics. In one study, a raised FE-UA (> 12%) had a 100% positive predictive value for diagnosis of SIAD regardless of recent diuretics. A challenge, however, is that such results may not be obtained at the point of care quickly enough to influence treatment decisions.

### Hyponatremia and brain injury: historical and contemporary perspectives [^c6ec670c]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in neurocritical care patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research into the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW), their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood. This paper reviews the history behind our understanding of hyponatremia in patients with neurologic injury, including the first reports of CSW and SIADH, and current and future challenges to diagnosis and management in this setting. Such challenges include distinguishing CSW, SIADH, and hypovolemic hyponatremia due to a normal pressure natriuresis from the administration of large volumes of fluids, and hyponatremia due to certain medications used in the neurocritical care population. Potential treatments for hyponatremia include mineralocorticoids and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists, but further work is required to validate their usage. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlining hyponatremia in neurocritical care patients remains our biggest obstacle to optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging population.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^c9242bcd]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status.

For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na +] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^268f80d2]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^6cc59ab8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is defined by a serum sodium (Na) concentration < 135 mmol/L. It is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients at a rate of 15–30%. A prospective cohort study of 98,411 hospitalised patients demonstrated that even mild hyponatraemia (Na 130–134 mmol/L) is associated with increased mortality in hospital (OR 1.37), at 1 year (OR 1.35) and at 5 years post discharge (OR 1.24).

Traditionally, hyponatraemia is classified clinically by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. The most common cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is characterized by dysregulated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, despite low serum Na and osmolality. Diagnostic criteria include: euvolaemic state, normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels, serum Na < 135 mmol/L, reduced serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/Kg and urine Na > 30 mmol/L.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^4c8cd27c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^69c2c422]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Management of hyponatremia… [^03cad679]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 13 shows an algorithm for the assessment of hyponatremia. The identification of hyponatremia must be followed by a clinical assessment of the patient, beginning with a targeted history to elicit the symptoms of hyponatremia and exclude important causes such as congestive heart failure, liver or renal impairment, malignancy, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, gastrointestinal losses, psychiatric illness, recent drug ingestion, surgery, or reception of intravenous fluids. EUVOLEMIC AND HYPOVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in a volume-depleted patient is caused by a deficit in total body sodium and total body water, with a disproportionately greater sodium loss, whereas in euvolemic hyponatremia, the total body sodium level is normal or near normal. Differentiating between hypovolemia and euvolemia may be clinically difficult, especially if the classic features of volume depletion such as postural hypotension and tachycardia are absent.

15 showed an increased BUN-to-creatinine ratio in only 68 percent of hypovolemic patients. Two useful aids for evaluating euvolemic or hypovolemic patients are measurement of plasma osmolality and urinary sodium concentration. Plasma osmolality testing places the patient into one of three categories, normal, high, or low plasma osmolality, while urinary sodium concentration testing is used to refine the diagnosis in patients who have a low plasma osmolality. INCREASED PLASMA OSMOLALITY Increased plasma osmolality in a patient with hyponatremia is caused by severe hyperglycemia, such as that occurring with diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. It is caused by the presence of glucose molecules that exert an osmotic force and draw water from the intracellular compartment into the plasma, with a diluting effect. Osmotic diuresis from glucose then results in hypovolemia.

Fortunately, hyperglycemia can be diagnosed easily by measuring the bedside capillary blood glucose level. DECREASED PLASMA OSMOLALITY Patients with low plasma osmolality can be hypovolemic or euvolemic. The level of urine sodium is used to further refine the differential diagnosis.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Hyponatremia among parturients transferred to the hospital after prolonged labor during an attempted home birth [^85dae51d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypovolemic hyponatremia has not been widely reported in the obstetric literature. Anecdotally, we noticed severe hyponatremia in several of our patients who presented as home birth transfers, leading to a review of home birth cases and hyponatremia. Given the morbidity associated with hyponatremia, it is important to be aware of its potential occurrence.

Case

We present the cases of two patients transferred to our hospital with hyponatremia after prolonged labor. These women presented with altered mental status, somnolence, and decreased urine output. Both were admitted to the intensive care unit but made a full recovery.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia is a serious potential complication of prolonged labor. We propose mechanisms for this condition and recommendations for surveillance and prevention.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^835b78f1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Copeptin Measurement in Hyponatremia

Copeptin has also been proposed as a diagnostic marker in hyponatremia, which makes sense from a pathophysiological point of view: underlying conditions leading to hyponatremia are assumed to be AVP dependent or AVP modulating and can be classified according to the patient's volume status (hypervolemic, hypovolemic, and euvolemic hyponatremia). Hypervolemic (due to heart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) and hypovolemic hyponatremia (eg, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses) are both characterized by decreased effective arterial blood volume, whereas euvolemic hyponatremia with SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis) as the most frequent cause is not.

The diagnostic approach to patients with hyponatremia is unsatisfactory and complex and accurate diagnostic markers would be of major clinical importance since hyponatremia is common and associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. The first prospective study investigating the role of copeptin in the differentiation of hyponatremia included 106 hyponatremic patients and showed no diagnostic utility of copeptin alone, but the ratio of copeptin to urinary sodium helped to discriminate between SIAD and conditions with decreased effective arterial blood volume and, therefore, hemodynamically stimulated AVP release (sensitivity 85%, specificity 87%).

A larger prospective observational study with copeptin measurements in 298 hypo-osmolar hyponatremic patients showed that clearly elevated copeptin levels > 84 pmol/L were indicative for hypovolemic hyponatremia (specificity 90%, sensitivity 23%). Conversely, very low levels < 3.9 pmol/L were diagnostic for primary polydipsia (specificity 91%, sensitivity, 58%). Although specificity for highest and lowest copeptin values was quite high, sensitivity was poor as most patients harbored copeptin measurements within the middle range. Those values overlapped widely between the different hyponatremia categories and copeptin was not helpful in differentiating between SIAD and other main causes of hyponatremia, such as hypovolemic and hypervolemic or diuretic-induced hyponatremia. Moreover, copeptin values also showed a broad variability within single categories (Fig. 3).

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^02a35807]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^7f0cd341]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The Hyponatremia Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Although patients were subject to adjudication by experts, some uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the diagnosis "cancer-related SIADH". Furthermore, potentially hyponatremia-inducing drugs are highly prevalent and interfere with diagnostic precision. However, since the study's intent was to capture "real-world" practice, this limitation does not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH in the oncology setting is managed. As in other hyponatremia trials, numerical changes of [Na +] were used as the primary measure of effectiveness; neither symptoms nor clinical outcome after therapy were reported routinely as it is extremely difficult to assign these unambiguously to hyponatremia, especially in the oncology setting.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of hyponatremia and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current management of hyponatremia in cancer-related SIADH are evident. Hyponatremia in a cancer patient is readily assumed by clinicians to be due to SIADH without sufficient attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Moreover, many patients correctly diagnosed with SIADH do not receive any treatment for hyponatremia at all, and a considerable number of patients are discharged with unresolved hyponatremia. FR and NS are the two most frequently used therapies but are ineffective in about two thirds of cases. Of note, this lack of efficacy is more pronounced in cancer patients than in non-cancer-related SIADH. With the vaptans, a group of highly effective and yet safe compounds is available and the findings of this analysis strongly suggests that they should be viewed as first-line choice of treatment. However, they are only used in the minority of cases in current practice. We therefore conclude that there is a need to focus educational efforts on (1) how to diagnose SIADH correctly, (2) the lack of uniform efficacy of FR and NS, (3) the use of active treatments, and (4) increasing awareness of risk factors for overcorrection. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor prognosis in particular in cancer patients, proof of causation is still lacking. Future research efforts should, therefore, focus on which cancer patients will benefit most from correction of hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^785914a5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^955fac56]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Caveats in treatment of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke

Current guidelines for the management of hyponatraemia do not refer specifically to patients with stroke. Thus, physicians should pay attention to some crucial points. First, any fluid resuscitation used for the restoration of low sodium levels should consider the type of stroke. Cerebral perfusion is important in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, but control and reduction of blood pressure is crucial in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Nevertheless, a close monitoring of patients' volume status and a vigilant fluid balance management are strongly recommended in both conditions. Second, any intervention aiming fluid restriction may be inappropriate in stroke patients due to increased risk for deteriorating an already impaired cerebral circulation. In addition, fluid restriction is also contra-indicated in hypovolemic states such as CSW, which can be misdiagnosed as SIADH. On the contrary, isotonic saline administration, commonly used in stroke patients, should be avoided in patients with SIADH-related hyponatraemia as it can aggravate hyponatraemia. Considering its neuroprotective effects and lower ODS risk compared with other therapies, urea may be an attractive option in treating stroke patients with hyponatraemia due to SIADH. It should be emphasized, however, that the clinical experience with urea administration is limited, especially in patients with stroke. Despite the evidence showing that conivaptan diminishes the cerebral edema and blood–brain barrier disruption in an experimental stroke model, studies evaluating the role of vaptans in hyponatraemic patients with stroke are lacking. On the contrary, the neuroprotective effects along with the well-established cardiorenal benefits of glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors cast them a promising therapy of non-hypovolemic chronic hyponatraemia. Finally, the presented algorithms for the restoration of sodium levels herein could also be used in patients with brain injuries, considering the increased prevalence of hyponatremia and its common aetiologies, such as SIADH and CSW, in the latter. Nevertheless, intracerebral haemorrhage is a separate disease with different causes and pathophysiology than stroke and thus any intervention should be personalized.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^dd7ed4d9]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in cancer patients [^c44a37d7]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte abnormality in oncology practice, may be a negative prognostic factor in cancer patients based on a systematic analysis of published studies. The largest body of evidence comes from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), for which hyponatremia was identified as an independent risk factor for poor outcome in six of 13 studies. Hyponatremia in the cancer patient is usually caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which develops more frequently with SCLC than with other malignancies. SIADH may be driven by ectopic production of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by tumors or by effects of anticancer and palliative medications on AVP production or action. Other factors may cause hypovolemic hyponatremia, including diarrhea and vomiting caused by cancer therapy. Hyponatremia may be detected on routine laboratory testing before or during cancer treatment or may be suggested by the presence of mostly neurological symptoms. Treatment depends on several factors, including symptom severity, onset timing, and extracellular volume status. Appropriate diagnosis is important because treatment differs by etiology, and choosing the wrong approach can worsen the electrolyte abnormality. When hyponatremia is caused by SIADH, hypertonic saline is indicated for acute, symptomatic cases, whereas fluid restriction is recommended to achieve a slower rate of correction for chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. Pharmacological therapy may be necessary when fluid restriction is insufficient. The orally active, selective AVP receptor 2 (V(2))-receptor antagonist tolvaptan provides a mechanism-based option for correcting hyponatremia caused by SIADH or other conditions with inappropriate AVP elevations. By blocking AVP effects in the renal collecting duct, tolvaptan promotes aquaresis, leading to a controlled increase in serum sodium levels.

### Utility and limitations of the traditional diagnostic approach to hyponatremia: a diagnostic study [^7a64bcf8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia is often challenging because of its association with multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diseases, and treatment options. Several algorithms are available to guide the diagnostic approach to hyponatremia, but their diagnostic and clinical utility has never been evaluated. We aimed to assess in detail the diagnostic utility as well as the limitations of the existing approaches to hyponatremia.

Methods

Each of the 121 consecutive subjects presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmoL/L) underwent 3 different and independent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: inexperienced doctor applying an established Algorithm, intensive care senior physicians acting as Senior Physician, and senior endocrinologist serving as Reference Standard.

Results

The overall diagnostic agreement between Algorithm and Reference Standard was 71% (respective Cohen's kappa and delta values were 0.64 and 0.70), the overall diagnostic agreement between Senior Physician and Reference Standard was 32% (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Regarding the therapeutic consequences, the diagnostic accuracy of the Algorithm was 86% (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and of the Senior Physician was 48% (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). In retrospect, by disregarding the patient's extracellular fluid volume and assessing the effective arterial blood volume by determination of the fractional urate excretion, the Algorithm improved its diagnostic accuracy to 95%.

Conclusion

Although the Algorithm performed reasonably well, several shortcomings became apparent, rendering it difficult to apply the Algorithm without reservation. Whether some modifications may enhance its diagnostic accuracy and simplify the management of hyponatremia needs to be determined.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^9868e5be]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment protocol for Hyponatremia

All patients were treated using our standardized therapeutic protocol for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). This therapeutic protocol fundamentally complied with the international treatment recommendations on chronic profound hyponatremia, although it did involve an exceptionally aggressive strategy to avoid under-treatment. The steps in this protocol are carried out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. First, all the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia. This evaluation involved (1) an interview about the history of the present illness, (2) vital signs, (3) physical examination, (4) laboratory data, and (5) echocardiography, if appropriate. Urine osmolality ≦100 mOsm/kg suggested that the hyponatremia was caused by primary polydipsia or poor sodium intake. Patientsand received cause-specific treatments, such as water restriction for primary polydipsia, discontinuation of a drug that caused hyponatremia, and amelioration of physiological stimulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In addition, if patients had severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or cardiorespiratory distress, an intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline of weight-based (2 mL/kg) amount was initiated until the symptoms improved. When the patients were relieved from these severe symptoms, they were assessed to determine the extracellular water (ECW) status. Patients were considered to have hypovolemic hyponatremia if the following findings were present, along with the discretion of the attending physician: history of gastrointestinal loss, reduced oral intake, thiazide usage, reduced turgor, or prolonged capillary refill time on physical examination, urine Na ≦ 30 mEq/L, and collapsed IVC on echography. Hydration with 0.9% saline at 1 mL/kg/h i.v. was initiated for patients who were diagnosed with reduced ECW. The administration speed of 0.9% saline was increased to 2 mL/kg/h when the patient could not take food orally.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^758a0619]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^df34360a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pathogenesis of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — The primary mechanism leading to the majority of EAH cases is overconsumption of hypotonic fluids, likely in combination with nonosmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP), and a hypovolemic form, although far less common than the symptomatic hypervolemic form, may be more prevalent in certain circumstances. AVP secretion may play a role in the majority of individuals with EAH, and release of AVP leads to water retention in the distal tubule of the kidney with a net result of lowering serum sodium; potential stimuli include nonspecific stresses, nausea/vomiting, hypoglycemia, exposure to heat, and possibly medication use such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Cerebral salt wasting in status epilepticus: two cases and review of the literature [^783a9f0f]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebral salt wasting is a hypovolemic hyponatremia state, caused by natriuresis and diuresis. The most important element of treatment is to replace the volume and sodium loss and improve the current clinic.

Patients

We present two children who were treated in the intensive care unit who subsequently developed cerebral salt wasting. Diagnosis was based on hyponatremia associated with high urinary sodium excretion and inappropriately high urine output in the presence of dehydration. As part of the treatment, one patient was given fluid and sodium replacement, measures that were insufficient in the other patient, who also required fludrocortisone treatment.

Conclusion

The status epilepticus may be involved in the etiology of cerebral salt wasting. In both patients, cerebral salt wasting was detected in the posttreatment follow-up evaluations. Cerebral salt wasting is particularly likely to occur in individuals with status epilepticus, and the electrolyte and hydration status of these patients should be monitored closely, even after the convulsions are taken under control.

### Improving management of hyponatraemia by increasing urine testing in the emergency department [^c0eb9a4a]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Moderate and severe hyponatraemia, defined by serum sodium < 130 mmol/L and 120 mmol/L, respectively, can cause a spectrum of symptoms ranging from weakness and ataxia to coma that can become life-threatening. The management of hyponatraemia is complex on multiple levels. First, a variety of aetiologies can cause hyponatraemia, including hypovolemia, hypervolemia, medication effects, neurologic injury, dietary insufficiencies, polydipsia, and endocrinopathies. Second, the management of hyponatraemia varies based on the underlying cause, and treatments for each aetiology differ significantly and can be opposite. For example, the treatment of hypovolemic hyponatraemia in a dehydrated patient is fluid administration; however, fluid administration in a patient with hypervolemic hyponatraemia from decompensated heart failure would worsen their hyponatraemia and clinical condition. Third, great care must be taken to neither correct hyponatraemia too quickly nor worsen hyponatraemia by applying the incorrect treatment, as this can lead to irreversible central pontine myelinosis or cerebral oedema, respectively, both of which can cause disability and death.

Urine osmolality and sodium measurements are cornerstone labs in the workup of hyponatraemia aetiology. Combined with serum studies, physical examinations and medication reviews, urine studies empower an understanding of the physiology driving a patient's hyponatraemia leading to appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Urine studies should be obtained before intravenous fluid or diuretic administration, as both interventions rapidly alter urine composition and confound the interpretation of urine study results.

Few studies address the rate of urine collection in the ED. A nationwide study of ED services from 2006 to 2008 demonstrated that approximately 90% of admitted patients underwent blood work while 40% had a urinalysis obtained. Another study focusing on inappropriate urinalysis testing found that ED urinalysis rates ranged from 19.5% to 78.5% at one institution based on chief complaint, with confused elderly women having the highest urinalysis rate and patients with chest pain having the lowest. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to assess the rate of urine collection in patients who present to the ED with hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^19dbc176]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^b3bf34d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^3df1d582]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis with ascites — definition, prevalence, and evaluation: Hyponatremia, defined as a serum Na concentration ≤ 135 mEq/L, is present in nearly half (49%) of patients with cirrhosis and ascites, with over a fifth (22%) having serum Na levels ≤ 130 mEq/L. Most patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and hyponatremia have hypervolemic hyponatremia; however, hypovolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia should be considered. Hypovolemic hyponatremia can occur because of poor oral intake or from urinary or gastrointestinal losses related to an excess of diuretic or laxative treatments, respectively. Euvolemic hyponatremia is uncommon among patients with cirrhosis unless there is a specific cause, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, medications (e.g., sertraline, carbamazepine), and severe hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms of hyponatremia, although infrequent in patients with cirrhosis, range from nausea, muscle cramps, gait instability, lethargy, headache, and dizziness to confusion and seizure.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^be0f98c6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing thiazide or thiazide-like treatment are at risk for hyponatremia, with a reported incidence of hyponatremia up to 30% in hospitalized patients. Patients with thiazide- or thiazide-like-associated hyponatremia (TAH) can either present with a diuretic-induced volume depletion and consequent hypovolemic hyponatremia, or with a picture of euvolemic hyponatremia mimicking a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), in which case it is referred to as SIAD-like TAH.

The European Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis and management of hypotonic hyponatremia propose a diagnostic algorithm based on urine indices (especially the measurement of urine osmolality and sodium) instead of the classical volume status assessment, of which the low sensitivity and specificity are well recognized. However, the use of urine indices is of little utility in patients with TAH, because thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics promote natriuresis and alter urine dilution. Fenske et al proposed the use of fractional uric acid excretion (FUA) in the differential diagnosis of TAH; however, their recommendation was based on data from only 7 patients.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics exert their mechanism of action not only on sodium, but also on chloride and potassium. We therefore aimed to evaluate the possible role of the imbalance between these 3 ions in the differential diagnosis of TAH. To do so, we calculated the simplified strong ion difference (serum sodium + potassium − chloride), a part of the Stewart model for acid-base disturbances. In brief, the Stewart model represents an alternative to bicarbonate-centered approaches and is especially used in anesthesiology and intensive care. According to Stewart, acid-base balance is the result of the strong ions difference (SID, calculated as the sum of measured cations minus the sum of measured anions), weak acids, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and aims to maintain electroneutrality in extracellular fluid. In stable patients with no critical illness (absence of severe hypoalbuminemia, of acute renal failure and/or respiratory failure), the simplified aSID could be sufficient to evaluate acid-base balance. A value > 40 mmol/L identifies patients with fluid depletion and contraction alkalosis due to relative hypochloremia, whereas a value < 40 mmol/L identifies patients with acidosis due to relative excess of water and therefore in need of fluid restriction.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^3ecf4d22]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Risk factors for EAH — For hypervolemic EAH, the major risk factor is excessive hypotonic fluid intake beyond the capacity for renal water excretion. High ambient temperatures appear to increase the risk of EAH, as do longer exercising times and nausea (with or without vomiting). Although women may have greater symptomatic hyponatremia incidence in some environments, when adjusted for body mass index and racing time the apparent sex difference was not statistically significant, meaning men and women are at equal risk for developing EAH and adverse consequences. Along with other nonsomotic stimuli to AVP secretion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been implicated as a potential risk factor by potentiating the water retention effects of AVP at the kidney, although direct causal evidence remains conflicting. The far less common hypovolemic EAH variant has been associated with chronic diuretic use, higher ambient temperatures, and longer duration of physical activity, especially in older men participating in long-duration exercise in remote settings.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^fb44250d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Brain natriuretic peptide concentrations after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: relationship with hypovolemia and hyponatremia [^a1eb965d]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia and hypovolemia occur often after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and are associated with poor outcome. The authors investigated whether brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is related to hypovolemia and hyponatremia after SAH and whether it can differentiate between hypovolemic and non-hypovolemic hyponatremia.

Methods

In 58 SAH patients, the authors daily measured serum BNP and sodium concentrations, and circulating blood volume by means of pulse dye densitometry, during the initial 10 days. For each patient, mean BNP concentrations were calculated until occurrence of the following events: hyponatremia (Na < 130 mmol/l), hypovolemia (blood volume < 60 ml/kg), and severe hypovolemia (blood volume < 50 ml/kg). The median day of onset of each event was calculated. In patients without an event, the authors calculated and used for comparison the mean BNP concentration until the median day of onset of the particular event. Odds Ratio's (OR) for high versus low mean BNP concentrations (dichotomized on median values per event) were calculated for the occurrence of each event and adjusted for relevant baseline characteristics.

Results

Patients with BNP above median more often had severe hypovolemia (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.2–15.0) and showed a trend toward hyponatremia (adjusted OR 3.3, 95% CI 0.7–9.2). In the 12 hyponatremic patients, BNP could not differentiate between hypovolemic and non-hypovolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusions

High BNP concentrations are related to the occurrence of severe hypovolemia and possibly hyponatremia. These data do not support a role for BNP measurements to differentiate between hypovolemic and non-hypovolemic hyponatremia in SAH patients.

### Copeptin in the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia [^10acfcb1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of patients with hyponatremia varies widely; thus, convenient diagnostic parameters are needed to guide the correct treatment strategy. This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of copeptin, the C-terminal part of provasopressin, as a new marker in the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, 106 consecutive hyponatremic patients were classified based on their history, clinical evaluation, and laboratory tests. In patients and 32 healthy control subjects, plasma copeptin concentration and standard biochemical parameters were tested for their utility of diagnosing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Results

Four patients (4%) were diagnosed as primary polydipsia, nine (8%) as diuretic-induced hyponatremia, 42 (40%) as SIAD, 29 (27%) as hypovolemic hyponatremia, and 22 patients (21%) as hypervolemic hyponatremia. In controls, a close correlation between plasma copeptin and serum sodium (r² = 0.62, P < 0.001) or urine osmolality (r² = 0.39, P = 0.001) was observed. Plasma copeptin levels were significantly higher in patients with hypo- and hypervolemic hyponatremia compared with SIAD (P < 0.005, respectively) and primary polydipsia (P < 0.001). The copeptin to U-Na ratio differentiated accurately between volume-depleted and normovolemic disorders (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81–0.95; P < 0.001), resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 87% if a cutoff value of 30 pmol/mmol was used. The combined information of plasma copeptin less than 3 pmol/liter and urine osmolality less than 200 mOsm/kg ensured primary polydipsia in 100% of suspected patients.

Conclusion

Copeptin measurement reliably identifies patients with primary polydipsia but has limited utility in the differential diagnosis of other hyponatremic disorders. In contrast, the copeptin to U-Na ratio is superior to the reference standard in discriminating volume-depleted from normovolemic hyponatremic disorders.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Hyponatremia in congestive heart failure [^bfeebc9e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia has been identified as a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and other edematous disorders and can lead to severe neurologic derangements. Low cardiac output and blood pressure associated with CHF triggers a compensatory response by the body that activates several neurohormonal systems designed to preserve arterial blood volume and pressure. Hyponatremia in patients with CHF is primarily caused by increased activity of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP increases free-water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, increasing blood volume and diluting plasma sodium concentrations. Hyponatremia may also be triggered by diuretic therapy used in the management of symptoms of CHF. Hyponatremic disorders occur when the normal ratio of solutes to body water content is altered by parallel changes in serum sodium and osmolality. Hyponatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium ion concentration < 135 to 136 mmol/L and can be broadly categorized into 2 types, dilutional or depletional. Dilutional hyponatremia is the most common form of hyponatremia and is caused by excess water retention. Depletional hyponatremia is usually hypovolemic, with an absolute deficiency of water but a relative excess of body water compared with sodium concentration.

Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.
