## Question

Esophagitis in teenagers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing esophagitis in adolescents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and which etiologies predominate in teenagers. Then, I should verify the age-specific symptom patterns that raise suspicion for eosinophilic esophagitis versus reflux disease. Next, I will review red flags and adaptive behaviors that can mask disease and delay diagnosis. After that, I need to check the diagnostic workup, including when to scope, how to biopsy, and what ancillary tests to order. Then, I will examine evidence-based treatment options, including PPIs, swallowed topical steroids, dietary therapy, and dilation, and I should confirm age-appropriate approvals and dosing. Finally, I will consider monitoring, transition-of-care planning, and special situations like infectious esophagitis and pill-induced injury, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the differential in adolescents with esophagitis. In this age group, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the leading cause of solid-food dysphagia and food impaction, whereas gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains common and can coexist with EoE, and infectious esophagitis (Candida, HSV, CMV) should be considered particularly in immunocompromised hosts or those with odynophagia, so I need to keep all three front-of-mind during triage [^112i1vQQ] [^112BtA5q] [^116A26js].

> Wait, let me verify the age-specific symptom pattern for EoE before I anchor on it. Adolescents typically present with dysphagia to solids, food impaction, and sometimes chest pain or heartburn that can mimic GERD; in contrast, younger children more often have vomiting, abdominal pain, or feeding refusal, so a teen with solid-food dysphagia or impaction should heighten suspicion for EoE rather than reflux alone [^1166XFMP] [^116MSBcr] [^116HQNrr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — symptoms can be subtle because teens adapt. I need to check for adaptive behaviors such as eating slowly, excessive chewing, drinking fluids with meals, avoiding breads or meats, or taking smaller bites, which can mask dysphagia and delay diagnosis. Using a structured tool like the I.M.P. A.C.T. questionnaire can surface these behaviors and shorten diagnostic delay in real-world practice [^1134b6S9] [^111GcDpF].

> I should confirm the red flags that warrant expedited endoscopic evaluation. Dysphagia to solids, recurrent food impaction, refractory GERD symptoms despite PPIs, atopic history, and a family history of EoE all increase pretest probability. Importantly, EoE and GERD can coexist, so persistent symptoms despite acid suppression should prompt biopsy rather than escalation of empiric therapy alone [^112i1vQQ] [^113VGtpV] [^115LNK15].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. Let me think about the endoscopic strategy: upper endoscopy with multiple esophageal biopsies is mandatory to diagnose EoE, and because EoE is patchy, I need to obtain at least six biopsies from at least two esophageal levels, ideally including both abnormal-appearing and normal-appearing mucosa to avoid false negatives. I should also document endoscopic features such as rings, furrows, exudates, edema, and strictures using a standardized framework like EREFS while remembering that a normal-appearing esophagus does not exclude EoE [^114yjiG7] [^112pMaxW] [^114JCv8Y].

> I will now examine the histologic threshold and the role of PPIs. The diagnostic criterion is a peak eosinophil count of at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field on esophageal biopsy after excluding other causes of eosinophilia; importantly, updated international consensus removed the requirement for a PPI trial because PPI-responsive eosinophilia is now considered part of the EoE spectrum rather than a separate entity, so I should not withhold EoE diagnosis solely on PPI response [^116xKmvs] [^112i1vQQ].

> But wait, what if symptoms are atypical or extraesophageal? I should double-check for concomitant GERD and consider esophageal pH-impedance testing when the clinical picture is mixed or when documenting acid/nonacid reflux would change management. In parallel, I need to exclude other causes of esophageal eosinophilia such as systemic eosinophilic disorders, infections, and pill-induced esophagitis, tailoring ancillary tests to the history and risk profile [^112BtA5q] [^116pWrNL] [^111Px3HW].

> Let me consider first-line therapy once EoE is confirmed. Three evidence-based options are acceptable: PPIs, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and dietary elimination. Choice should be individualized to patient preference, atopy profile, nutritional risk, and access to dietetic support, and I should set expectations that EoE is chronic and relapses when therapy is stopped, which argues for maintenance strategies in most patients [^1166XFMP] [^112KTegf] [^116PUDE4].

> I should confirm PPI efficacy and dosing. PPIs are effective for symptom control and can reduce eosinophil counts in a subset, with adolescent response rates around 60–70% in some series. Typical pediatric dosing uses weight-based regimens or adult-equivalent high-dose therapy, and I need to reassess histology if symptoms persist to avoid anchoring bias [^1134MvZV] [^112mr2XB] [^1166XFMP].

> Next, I should review swallowed topical corticosteroids. Fluticasone or budesonide oral suspension, when properly administered as a swallowed viscous formulation, achieve high histologic remission rates and improve endoscopic features; pooled adolescent data for budesonide oral suspension 2.0 mg twice daily demonstrate robust histologic and endoscopic responses over 12 weeks, with acceptable tolerability, supporting use in teens who prefer pharmacotherapy over diet [^112pMaxW] [^1136RckJ] [^115YbvDq].

> Hold on, I should verify dietary therapy options and their trade-offs. Elemental diets yield the highest histologic remission but are often impractical; six-food elimination diets are effective but require endoscopic reintroduction and monitoring; targeted elimination based on allergy testing alone is less reliable due to mixed IgE/non-IgE mechanisms, so if I use diet, I should pair it with structured follow-up and histologic reassessment to confirm remission and identify triggers [^112mr2XB] [^112KTegf] [^117GTmDa].

> I need to ensure I address fibrostenotic disease. If strictures or fixed rings cause persistent dysphagia despite anti-inflammatory therapy, esophageal dilation is indicated. Although the EoE mucosa is fragile, carefully selected dilation with experienced operators is safe and effective, but I must combine dilation with ongoing medical or dietary therapy because dilation treats the lumen, not the inflammation [^116AVnXz] [^113Bc2Ku] [^112mr2XB].

> Let me reconsider the role of biologics for refractory disease. Dupilumab is FDA-approved for EoE in patients aged 12 years and older and has demonstrated histologic remission and symptom benefits; in younger children, recent pediatric data led to approval down to age 1 year, so for adolescents with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy, dupilumab is a reasonable next step within a multidisciplinary framework [^114aSati].

> Next, I should review monitoring and endpoints. I should integrate symptoms, endoscopic appearance, and histology, recognizing that symptoms and eosinophil counts can be discordant. Validated tools like the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire help quantify change, and serial endoscopies with biopsies are typically needed every 1–2 years or sooner if symptoms recur, with at least six biopsies from multiple levels to mitigate sampling error [^115j3TVE] [^113Bc2Ku] [^114yjiG7].

> I will now examine transition planning because most teens will age out of pediatric care. A formal, structured transition with transfer of records, education on adherence, and coordination with adult providers reduces emergency presentations and improves long-term control; I should start this process early and ensure the patient understands maintenance needs and red flags for relapse [^113eTNcv] [^111cnZDc].

> But wait, what if the presentation suggests infection rather than EoE or GERD? In adolescents with odynophagia, immunosuppression, or recent antibiotics, I should consider Candida, HSV, or CMV esophagitis and tailor empiric therapy while arranging timely endoscopy with appropriate stains and cultures; if symptoms fail to improve, I should reassess for refractory infection or alternative immunologic etiologies per guideline prompts [^116A26js] [^114q2XBF].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with consensus guidance. The approach of suspecting EoE in teens with solid-food dysphagia or impaction, confirming with endoscopic biopsies, and offering PPIs, swallowed steroids, or elimination diets with structured follow-up is consistent with contemporary ACG and BSG/BSPGHAN guidance; I need to document shared decision-making, monitor growth and nutrition, and adjust therapy based on histologic response to prevent fibrostenotic complications [^1166XFMP] [^112i1vQQ] [^112KTegf].

Esophagitis in teenagers most often reflects **GERD or EoE** [^116A26js], with EoE rising rapidly and now a leading cause of dysphagia and food impaction in this age group [^112NaJyi] [^113hFnBD]. Diagnosis relies on **endoscopy with biopsies** to distinguish EoE (≥ 15 eos/hpf) from reflux and other causes, and to detect complications like strictures [^112GDLuR] [^113Bc2Ku]. Management is individualized: PPIs, swallowed topical steroids, or elimination diets for EoE; PPIs and lifestyle for GERD; and dilation for fibrostenotic disease [^111MNUPu] [^112KTegf] [^116AVnXz]. Early recognition and therapy prevent remodeling and strictures, and **transition planning to adult care is essential** [^113eTNcv] [^113Bc2Ku].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The **main etiologies** of esophagitis in adolescents are:

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Common in adolescents; risk increases with obesity, delayed gastric emptying, and dietary triggers [^112BtA5q].

- **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)**: A chronic, immune-mediated disease with rising prevalence; strongly associated with atopy and food allergens [^112i1vQQ] [^112NaJyi].

- **Infectious esophagitis**: Less common; consider in immunocompromised or those with recent antibiotics [^116A26js].

- **Medication-induced esophagitis**: Associated with tetracyclines, NSAIDs, and others [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary by **etiology** and **age**:

| **Etiology** | **Common symptoms in adolescents** |
|-|-|
| GERD | - Heartburn <br/> - Regurgitation <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Nausea [^notfound] |
| EoE | - Dysphagia <br/> - Food impaction <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Heartburn [^111Decne] [^116MSBcr] |
| Infectious | - Odynophagia <br/> - Dysphagia <br/> - Fever <br/> - Immunocompromise [^116A26js] |
| Medication-induced | - Odynophagia <br/> - Dysphagia <br/> - Recent medication use [^notfound] |

---

Adaptive behaviors (slow eating, excessive chewing, drinking with meals) are common in EoE and can **delay diagnosis** [^1134b6S9] [^111GcDpF].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Identify symptoms, triggers, atopy, and medication use [^1166XFMP].

- **Upper endoscopy with biopsies**: Gold standard; obtain ≥ 6 biopsies from multiple esophageal levels to detect patchy EoE [^114iBWoR] [^111Z8mXp].

- **Histopathology**: EoE defined by ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field after excluding other causes [^116xKmvs] [^112i1vQQ].

- **PPI trial**: PPIs can reduce eosinophilia; PPI-responsive EoE is now recognized as EoE, not a separate entity [^116xKmvs] [^112i1vQQ].

- **Allergy testing**: Limited role; not definitive for EoE triggers [^112mr2XB].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to etiology and severity**:

### GERD

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation [^notfound].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: PPIs are first-line; H2 receptor antagonists for mild cases [^notfound].

- **Long-term monitoring**: Persistent symptoms may require ongoing therapy [^112yUDvD].

---

### Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)

- **PPIs**: First-line; effective in ~50–70% of patients [^112mr2XB].

- **Swallowed topical steroids**: Fluticasone or budesonide; high histologic remission rates [^112pMaxW] [^1136RckJ].

- **Elimination diets**: Empiric 6-food elimination or targeted diets; effective but challenging [^112KTegf] [^112mr2XB].

- **Endoscopic dilation**: For fibrostenotic disease or food impaction [^116AVnXz] [^113Bc2Ku].

- **Biologics**: Dupilumab for refractory EoE; FDA-approved for patients ≥ 12 years [^112p1x4y].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated esophagitis can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Esophageal strictures**: Common in chronic EoE, causing persistent dysphagia [^113Bc2Ku].

- **Food impaction**: Frequent in EoE, often requiring emergency endoscopy [^116HQNrr].

- **Esophageal perforation**: Rare but serious, associated with EoE [^112i1vQQ].

- **Quality of life impairment**: Significant psychosocial burden, especially with dietary restrictions [^113M8BhP].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate therapy, but EoE is chronic and relapsing; ongoing treatment and monitoring are required [^116PUDE4]. Early diagnosis and therapy reduce stricture risk and improve quality of life [^114tbDCr].

---

## Transition of care

Adolescents require **structured transition** to adult services to maintain control, adherence, and reduce emergencies [^113eTNcv].

---

Esophagitis in teenagers is **most often due to GERD or EoE**, with EoE rising rapidly. Accurate diagnosis via endoscopy and biopsies guides therapy, which includes PPIs, swallowed steroids, elimination diets, and dilation as needed. Early, individualized management prevents complications, and structured transition to adult care is critical for long-term outcomes [^116A26js] [^116xKmvs] [^111MNUPu] [^113hFnBD] [^116PUDE4] [^113eTNcv] [^116mfcJn].

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the passage of stomach contents into the esophagus. It is a normal physiologic process in both adults and children. It occurs throughout the day in infants and less often in children and adolescents, typically after meals. It may be asymptomatic or cause mild, non-troubling symptoms such as regurgitation or occasional vomiting. However, when reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications, it represents a pathological condition named gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Symptoms suggestive of GER are not rare in childhood and are a major reason for parental concern irrespective of the child's age. Epidemiologic studies are complicated by unreliable reporting of symptoms in younger children (< 8 years) and infants, in whom often are the parents who interpret symptoms as being troublesome or not. Therefore, the prevalence of GERD is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the child, the parents and the health-care professionals, since not all patients with GERD develop objective symptoms and signs such as esophagitis. It is estimated that in older children and adolescents, the overall prevalence of GERD in Europe ranges from 10 to 20%, with a lower proportion of patients needing some investigation or pharmacologic intervention. As a rule, a comprehensive history and clinical examination are sufficient in most infants and children to diagnose GERD, but judicious investigations are necessary in some patients. Although endoscopy with biopsy and histologic evaluation represents the gold standard for detection of mucosal lesions, the prevalence of erosive esophagitis in children is lower compared with adults, with up to 80% of them belonging to one of the three NERD phenotypes.

Like in adults, GERD is primarily a motor disorder and its pathogenesis is multifactorial. The main motility abnormalities include an impaired function of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), an abnormal esophageal clearance, and a delayed gastric emptying in up to 40% of cases. The presence of hiatal hernia favors reflux, but this association is not mandatory. The ultimate consequence of the above motor abnormalities is the presence of acid in the wrong site (i.e. in contact with the esophageal mucosa). In addition, the amount of reflux increases markedly after meals in both healthy subjects and GERD patients, an event almost exclusively due to the increase of transient (inappropriate) LES relaxations by meal-induced gastric accommodation. Even though the pathophysiology and symptoms of pediatric GERD (especially older patients) are similar to those in adults, children may also present with a wide range of distinct gastroesophageal and extra-esophageal symptoms and potential complications.

What Is Known
Primary treatment approaches for eosinophilic esophagitis include topical corticosteroids or food elimination. These single treatment approaches are effective.

What Is New
The combination of topical corticosteroids with specific food elimination is as effective in achieving clinical and histological remissions as the single treatment approaches.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune- or antigen-mediated clinicopathologic disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration (≥ 15 eosinophils [eos]/high-power field [hpf]). Among pediatric patients, the incidence of EoE is 0.7 to 10 cases per 100,000 children. Infants and toddlers present with feeding difficulties, whereas school-aged children generally exhibit vomiting and abdominal pain. Teenagers usually present with dysphagia, epigastric pain, and food impaction. Untreated EoE can progress to more serious conditions, such as dysphagia and esophageal strictures, during adulthood. These EoE-related conditions are associated with significant morbidity. Thus, effective and early treatment of pediatric EoE is critical for preventing long-term esophageal problems.

Primary treatment options for EoE include topical corticosteroids, food elimination, and elemental diets. High-dose topical corticosteroids and specific elimination diets improve symptoms, reduce esophageal eosinophilic mucosal infiltrates, and improve endoscopic markers of inflammation. Allergic comorbidities occur in 42% to 93% of pediatric patients, with food allergies being the most common. An elemental diet based on an amino acid–based formula is the most effective dietary therapy for pediatric EoE, resulting in 96% histological improvement. High cost, poor taste, and nutritional deficiencies, however, limit the use of this treatment option. The 6-food elimination diet (SFED) with subsequent reintroduction of the offending foods and endoscopic reevaluation is extremely effective in children. Although 74% histological improvement occurs with this strategy, the expense of multiple upper endoscopic procedures limits its application. A selective elimination diet based on skin testing produced promising results with 75% symptomatic and histological improvement in a large pediatric series. This test-based elimination diet is based on a skin-prick test (SPT) for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food hypersensitivity and an atopic patch test (APT) for non-IgE–mediated delayed-food hypersensitivity. Thus, although several treatment options have been tested, limitations of individual approaches and lack of a standardized therapeutic strategy complicate the management of EoE.

### The challenges of managing multiple food allergies and consequent food aversions [^1127g5Rj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The allergic march can often result in children with one food allergy phenotype developing other allergic manifestations as they grow older. In this grand round, we describe the case of a child with a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis at an early age, who subsequently developed IgE-mediated allergy to milk and egg. Because of the onset of allergic rhinitis, an additional complication of the teenage years was the development of pollen food syndrome, which further affected the already complex dietary management. These multiple allergies had a consequent effect on nutritional status and provoked considerable psychosocial issues, which greatly affected the patient's relationship with food. This case illustrates that for complex patients, a cohesive approach and shared decision-making are essential for diagnosis and management. Working with the patient and also the whole family, and considering how best to support them, necessitates a flexible approach. Regular follow-up is important to address changing psychosocial and dietary needs and monitor the resolution of allergies and response to pharmacotherapy. Complex patients need the input of a comprehensive multidisciplinary team, with good access to dietetic and psychological support, to optimize quality of life for these individuals and their families.

### Guidelines on eosinophilic esophagitis: evidence-based statements and recommendations for diagnosis and management in children and adults [^115LNK15]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, EAACI/ESPGHAN/EUREOS/UEG 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- EoE is a chronic, local immune-mediated esophageal disease, characterized clinically by symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation; do not interpret clinical manifestations or pathologic data in isolation

- solid food dysphagia, food impaction, and non-swallowing associated chest pain are the most commonly reported symptoms in adult patients with EoE

- untreated EoE is usually associated with persistent symptoms and inflammation, leading to esophageal remodeling resulting in stricture formation and functional abnormalities

- EoE significantly impacts the health-related QoL impairing the social and psychological functioning

- there is no evidence that EoE is a premalignant condition

- EoE appears to have no causal or temporal relationship with hypereosinophilic syndromes, IBD, esophageal atresia, and connective tissue disorders

- EoE is a distinct form of food allergy and IgE-mediated food allergies are common in patients with EoE

- rhinitis, asthma, and eczema are significantly more common in patients with EoE compared to the general population, however, insufficient evidence to support that atopy predisposes to EoE

- EoE and GERD are different entities and may coexist, either unrelated or interacting bidirectionally.

Clinical presentation in children and adults

Symptoms of EoE follow a hierarchal and pyramidal pattern from early childhood to adulthood (Table 2). Clinical presentation in young children is reported and filtered by the caregiver. Infants and toddlers usually present non-specific symptoms such as reflux-like symptoms, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, food refusal, and failure to thrive. It has been widely described that clinical presentation varies by age: failure to thrive in the youngest children (median age 2.0 years), vomiting in older children (median age 8.1 years), abdominal pain in young adolescents (median age 12.0 years), and dysphagia (mean age 13.4 years) and food impaction (median age 16.8 years) in older adolescents.

Table 2.
Clinical presentation in children and adults.–

In contrast, adults predominantly complain of dysphagia to solids, followed by food impaction. The impaction of a food bolus is a typical and recurring symptomwhich sometimes requires an emergency upper endoscopy for unblocking. EoE can mimic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in its presentation with heartburn and regurgitation. Exercise-induced chest pain is also common among adults. Some patients report minimal symptoms, and in such cases, the clinician should investigate dietary and behavioral modification, that is, eating slowly, excessive mastication before swallowing, drinking often to push the bolus down while eating, and avoidance of solid foods; this is so that patients spontaneously adapt to the reduced distensibility of the esophagus.

Both children and adults have higher rates of allergic diathesis than the general population, and most patients have asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis. Accordingly, EoE is more commonly associated to IgE-mediated food sensitization in children, and milk, eggs, soy, wheat/rye, beef, and peanuts are the main triggers. In adults, hypersensitivity to aeroallergens such as pollens is also common. Despite such strong evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, EoE is not directly mediated by IgEand eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells and cytokines are also involved.

Moreover, in EoE therapeutic protocol context, it is necessary to clearly outline the concept of full disease control as a primary end point of treatment, by defining a shared position supported by clinical and literature evidence regarding the role that continuous or intermittent therapy (cycling or stacking) can have in this chronic and progressive disease. Due to these challenges, there is a dire need for comprehensive research to guide clinical practice in pediatric, adolescent, and adult EoE patients.

To address these unmet needs, this work aims to develop a comprehensive knowledge based on the EoE management, addressing existing gaps in diagnosis, definition of control, switching therapy, and follow-up. All recommendations reported here were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of nine experts in the EoE (EoExperts) field including adult and pediatric gastroenterologists, gastro-pediatricians, internal medicine specialists, allergo-immunologists, and pathologists from nine different referral EoE centers across Italy.

### Psychometric evaluation of the dysphagia symptom questionnaire for adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis [^112yLJvQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by local eosinophilic inflammation leading to symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. EoE may be either sporadic or familial, with an estimated 7% of individuals with EoE having a family member also affected by EoE. More than 1 in 1000 people currently live with EoE in Europe and North America, where prevalence is the highest; the incidence rate ranges from 5 to 20 new cases per 100,000 people annually in both adults and children. Symptoms of EoE are detrimental to the health-related quality of life of patients, who report significant physical, psychological, and social burdens. As EoE progresses, chronic inflammation can lead to fibrosis; this fibrosis in turn contributes to food impactions, which can require emergent endoscopic removal to relieve. Thus, diagnosis in the early stages of disease is key. Although there is no cure for EoE, treatment options include dietary changes, swallowed topical steroids (fluticasone or budesonide), a biologic (dupilumab), and endoscopic therapy with esophageal dilation. Anti-inflammatory agents have been investigated as more effective treatments for EoE.

Although younger children with EoE experience a range of symptoms, dysphagia is the most prevalent EoE symptom in both adults and adolescents, and as such is an important patient-reported end point in clinical trials evaluating therapeutics for EoE. A number of disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures have been used to measure EoE symptoms in a clinical trial setting, including the Straumann Dysphagia Index, the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Activity Index, the Dysphagia Numeric Rating Scale, and the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ was developed in accordance with guidance from the US Food and Drug Administrationto measure the daily frequency and severity of dysphagia associated with EoE. Since the initial development of the DSQ in 2013, its content validity and psychometric properties have been evaluated and described. The DSQ has been applied successfully in several clinical trials to evaluate patient outcomes. Strengths of the DSQ include its daily recall period, its development with both adult and adolescent patients, and its assessment of both frequency and severity of dysphagia.

### Caustic ingestion: a possible cause of eosinophilic esophagitis? [^112WW3x4]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging disease in both pediatric and adult patients. It is a chronic disease of the esophagus and refers to intense eosinophilic infiltration limited to the esophageal epithelium in the absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In most patients, EoE is thought to be part of an allergic response to food antigens or aeroallergens. One such trigger could be caustic damage of the mucosa. To the best of our knowledge, the following case report describes for the first time the possible association between caustic injury of the esophagus and EoE.

### Evaluation of the child who has eosinophilic esophagitis [^114rAwcn]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Children who have eosinophilic esophagitis require comprehensive evaluation before treatment and ongoing assessment during treatment. When completed at the appropriate times and under well-controlled circumstances, investigation yields the correct diagnosis, assures recognition of sequelae or recurrence of the inflammation, or confirms whether therapy has been effective. Proper management of each child depends on compulsive follow-up until all of the therapeutic goals have been achieved and the child is on a stable regimen without esophageal inflammation. This article summarizes the issues facing the patient and the physician during this process.

In Experts opinion, I.M.P. A.C.T. Questionnaire emerges as a valuable asset in the diagnostic toolkit for EoE, offering a structured method to quantify and interpret the subtle behavioral adaptations characteristic of this condition.

Together with the corresponding best practice guidelines for effective and timely diagnosis, the main "Challenges in EoE clinical practice" for addressing signs for EoE suspicion in clinical, endoscopic, and histological evaluation have been identified and evaluated by EoExpert.

It was further emphasized that evaluating at least six biopsies from at least two different sites (ideally two proximal, two medial, and two distal) is recommended to reach a diagnosis of EoE in most cases. It has been shown that sampling a single proximal or distal biopsy leads to a failure to diagnose EoE in 15% of cases. All agreed and validated recommendations are listed in Figure 2.

Figure 2.
List of EoE Experts stated and agreed recommendations within the "Challenges in EoE: rules of good clinical practice for the diagnostic and therapeutic path". The main challenges, with the related best clinical practices, are summarized here in order to provide a guiding tool to perform a correct clinical, endoscopic, and histological evaluation, and therefore obtain an accurate diagnosis of EoE.

EoE, eosinophilic esophagitis.

Therapeutic approach

In agreement with different position papers and guidelines, including ESPGHAN, EUREOS, EoEtaly panel expert opinion, and International Experts Guidelines, EoExpert states that EoE is a chronic inflammation of the esophagus that potentially progresses from an inflammatory to a fibrostenotic phenotype and, if left untreated, can lead to persistent symptoms and the development of strictures. Effective therapy can limit the progression of the disease. Based on this evidence, the possible coexistence of other type 2 comorbidities must be considered during the diagnostic workup. An integrated clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological examination involving key specialists including gastroenterologists, gastro-pediatrics, allergists/immunologists, internal medicine specialists, and pathologists is therefore strongly recommended to ensure more effective, timely diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care of adult and pediatric EoE patients.

Background and objective

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive T-helper type 2-mediated inflammatory disorder of the esophagus, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in the esophageal epithelium. If left untreated, EoE can progress to fibrostenotic lesions, up to the development of esophageal strictures. The etiopathogenesis of EoE is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, immunological responses to antigenic and environmental factors. The clinical presentation is often heterogeneous and shows age-dependent characteristics that include a broad spectrum of symptoms: failure to thrive in the youngest children, vomiting in older children, abdominal pain in young adolescents, dysphagia and food impaction, retrosternal pain, and manifestations mimicking gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in older adolescents and adults. All these features make EoE diagnosis quite challenging. – Patients with EoE have substantially impaired quality of life (QoL), with several social and psychological implications of food-related illness.

The diagnosis of EoE requires an integrated analysis of the patient's clinical history in the context of a proper endoscopic and histological evaluation in a multidisciplinary setting with gastroenterologists, pathologists, allergists, and pediatric specialists' involvement. Current treatment schedules include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), topical corticosteroids (TCS), exclusion of trigger foods (elimination diets), and, in specific cases, esophageal dilation.

It is necessary to underline that currently in Europe there are no in-label conventional treatments for EoE in pediatric population (< 12 years old), which leads to off-label use of medications for these patients,: in this age group (1–11 years old, weighing ⩾15 kg), only biological therapy (Dupilumab) has been investigated and more recently received positive opinion by EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). For European adolescents and adults, approved treatments include TCS, such as budesonide in orodispersible formulation (Jorveza in EU for people ⩾18 years old), and Dupilumab (⩾12 years old). Moreover, in February 2024, budesonide oral suspension (Eohilia™; Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S. A. Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with EoE aged ⩾11 years, based on the data from ORBIT1 and NCT01642212.

Endoscopic assessment recommendations and natural history in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): On endoscopy, it was recommended to assess esophageal rings and strictures but not to include specific EREFS thresholds due to a lack of data regarding thresholds for severity and because endoscopists do not frequently detect strictures or esophageal narrowing; EoE appears to progress to fibrostenosis in many, although not all, patients, and an ultimate goal should be to diagnose and treat EoE early enough such that patients neither develop nor progress to fibrostenosis; recognition includes symptoms of dysphagia and food impaction in adolescents and adults, and it is important to consider performing esophageal dilation in symptomatic patients.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a recently defined condition that has dramatically increased in prevalence in the last several decades. It may occur at any age, but the clinical presentation in young children is often more vague than the classic solid food dysphagia and food impacting that are the major presenting symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents. Successful therapies exist, including medications and dietary modifications, but disease typically recurs when the intervention is discontinued.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is an immune-mediated allergic disease of the esophagus that affects pediatric patients of all ages. The diagnosis is made by esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrating eosinophilic infiltrate of the esophagus. Approaches to treatment involve proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), swallowed topical steroid preparations, as well as dietary elimination. In this review we discuss the evidence and efficacy of each of these approaches.

In conclusion, EoE is an emerging disorder whose diagnosis is often delayed. Early detection may lead to anticipating treatment and preventing the disorder, or at least decelerating the development of complications. Treatment options and endpoints should be tailored individually to achieve lasting compliance. This is crucial because EoE is a chronic disease that almost invariably relapses when the treatment is withdrawn.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116dCqeb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the absence of secondary causes, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, local, progressive, T-helper type 2 immune-mediated disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. In the last 20 years, the incidence and prevalence of EoE have risen sharply, and the chances of encountering affected patients in clinics and endoscopy rooms have increased. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6 years in both children and adults. Unfortunately, the longer the disease stays unrecognized, the likelier it is for the patient to have persistent or increased esophageal eosinophilic inflammation, to complain of non-resolving symptoms, and to develop fibrotic complications. Early detection depends on the recognition of initial clinical manifestations that vary from childhood to adulthood and even among patients of the same age. The disease phenotype also influences therapeutic approaches that include drugs, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. We have herein reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE focusing on differences and similarities between children and adults that may certainly serve in daily clinical practice.

Eosinophilic esophagitis — pediatric dupilumab (ages 1–11 years) is suggested for patients nonresponsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy, with low-quality evidence and conditional strength, supported by a randomized pediatric trial showing histologic benefit and subsequent regulatory approval details. We suggest dupilumab as a treatment for EoE in pediatric patients (ages 1–11 years) who are nonresponsive to PPI therapy (quality of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: conditional). Dupilumab was studied in 102 children aged 1–11 years in a 2-part randomized trial of 2 dosing regimens compared to placebo; in part 1 over 16 weeks the primary outcome was histologic response defined as ≤ 6 eos/hpf, and in part 2 patients received active treatment for an additional 36 weeks. After 16 weeks, histologic response rates were 68%, 58%, and 19% in the high-exposure, lower-exposure, and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.0001), and 16-week responses were maintained through 52 weeks. Based on these data, in February 2024 the FDA approved dupilumab for EoE in patients aged 1–11 years and weighing at least 15 kg, with 2 weight-based dosages administered every other week, contrasted with a weekly dose in patients 12 years and above; the pediatric safety profile was consistent with adolescent/adult EoE trials and other dupilumab programs.

FIGURE 5
Emergency room visits in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, stratified by associated diagnosis. GERD indicates gastroesophageal reflux disease.

During the 12-month preindex period, 6.0% of patients (1383/23,003) had at least 1 recorded inpatient admission for any reason [mean (SD) number of inpatient days, 0.37 (2.32)] compared with 11.7% of patients (2691/23,003) during the follow-up period [mean (SD) annualized number of inpatient days, 0.52 (3.29)]. "Foreign body in the esophagus" (2.2%) and "EoE" (4.3%) were the most common diagnoses associated with inpatient admission before and after diagnosis of EoE, respectively. The mean (SD) length of stay among hospitalized patients was 6.09 (7.37) days (range: 1 to 106 d) during the preindex period compared with 4.42 (8.67) days (range: 0.13 to 172.5 d) during the follow-up period.

Overall, 29.6% of patients (6820/23,003) had claims for a diagnostic endoscopy during the preindex period (Table 1), compared with 57.6% (13,234/23,003) on the index date and 25.1% (5782/23,003) during the follow-up period (exclusive of the index date). During the follow-up period, a greater proportion of adolescents (83.8%) and children (83.6%) had claims for a diagnostic endoscopy than adults aged 18 to 54 years (76.1%) and adults aged ≥ 55 years (74.5%).

Even though chest pain in children is a common complaint, an underlying gastrointestinal cause is rare. The four common gastrointestinal conditions that present with chest pain include eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal dysmotility, and foreign body ingestion. Other than ingestion of certain foreign bodies, most of these conditions are not life-threatening. Associated symptoms and history may be helpful in distinguishing these disorders, but further evaluation is often indicated to identify the precise cause.

A recent study by Lenti et al. revealed a median diagnostic delay of 3 years for EoE. One approach to hasten EoE diagnosis involves recognizing the concurrent presence of various warning signs, such as difficulty in swallowing, food impaction, reflux symptoms, noncardiac chest pain, a history of atopic/type 2 inflammatory diseases and food allergies, and, in young patients, failure to thrive.

A survey was conducted to explore physician perceptions of diagnostic challenges within the Italian context. Results indicated that physicians estimate an average of 41 (standard deviation: ± 23.89) out of every 100 patients are correctly diagnosed with EoE (diagnosed prevalence). Additionally, clinicians were asked to identify, based on their experience, the most critical factors for a timely and accurate diagnosis. Red flags were categorized into three main groups: patient's clinical history, exclusion of other possible confounding conditions for diagnosis, and performing endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. The analysis of results (Figure 4) highlighted bolus impaction (mean score = 6.4) as the most significant factor for a correct and timely diagnosis. This finding was supported by 88.5% of respondents who regarded bolus impaction as crucial (score of 5–7). The survey also indicated that other critical factors for a correct diagnosis included accurate biopsy sampling (mean score = 6.1), presence of dysphagia (mean score = 5.7), and characteristic lesions observed during endoscopy (mean score = 5.3).

The relapse rate with PPIs seemed to be lower (0.15 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.09–0.23), but the estimate was retrieved just from 2 small observational studies.

Safety

Results of MA on safety outcomes (based on RCTs only, based on observational studies only, and overall) are presented in Table III, and forest plots for each outcome are presented in Figs E24 to E51 (in this article's Additional Material 5 section in the Online Repository).

Table III
Adverse event rates estimated from the MA

Annual rate of adverse events was 2.55 cases per PY (95% CI, 1.73–3.74). The estimate was significantly higher in the RCTs than in the observational studies (2.92 vs 1.34; p = 0.005). However, in both RCTs and observational studies, almost all adverse events were nonserious (2.84 and 1.31 cases per PY, respectively). Consequently, the rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation was low (0.21 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.11–0.40), with no significant difference among RCTs and observational studies (P = 0.448). Similarly, adverse events leading to hospitalization were rare because they were reported in only 2 studies and the overall rate was very low (0.03 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.01–0.10).

The most common adverse events reported in the RCTs were (1) infections (1.10 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.80–1.53), mainly esophageal candidiasis or upper tract infection (1.02 and 0.50 cases per PY, respectively); (2) contact dermatitis or hives (0.63 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.15–2.63); (3) gastrointestinal disorders (0.51 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.17–1.56); (4) respiratory disorders (0.46 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.28–0.76); and (5) blood cortisol decrease (0.40 cases per PY; 95% CI, 0.15–1.07). The severity of all events of blood cortisol decrease was mild to moderate and the events resolved after treatment discontinuation without clinical consequences.

EoE diagnostic process

The mean (SD) duration from the first EoE symptom to the index date was 11.3 (16.1) and 17.4 (31.8) months for adolescents and adults, respectively (Table 2); this increased significantly with increasing EoE disease severity (p < 0.001). When EoE was first suspected, reports of food impactions in adolescents and reports of dysphagia, food impactions, regurgitation, and vomiting in adults significantly increased with increasing EoE disease severity (all, p < 0.01; Figure 2(a) and (b)). At the index date, reports of dysphagia and food impactions numerically increased with increasing EoE disease severity in adolescents (Figure 3(a)). However, in adults, reports of food impactions, regurgitation, and weight loss at the index date significantly increased with EoE disease severity (all p < 0.01; Figure 3(b)). The proportion of adults with endoscopic findings indicative of EoE and the proportion of adolescents and adults with marked/elevated eosinophilia (determined at the physician's discretion, based on information from the patients' medical charts) or a peak eosinophil count of ⩾15 eos/hpf generally increased with increasing EoE disease severity. Endoscopic findings were generally based on biopsies from multiple sites (distal and proximal), irrespective of EoE disease severity (Table 2).

### Epidemiology and etiology of eosinophilic esophagitis [^117Sy8uG]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. Symptoms of EE are variable, and include gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, abdominal pain, growth failure, and dysphagia. Dysphagia is a more common presentation in adults and older children. Serious complications of EE consisting of esophageal food impactions necessitating urgent endoscopic removal of the food and esophageal strictures requiring endoscopic balloon dilatations are also seen. The potential severity of these symptoms points to the importance of proper recognition and management of the disease, especially given that EE has become more prevalent over the past decade. In this article, available evidence on the epidemiology and etiology of EE is discussed.

The clinical presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults is varied but most often starts with some form of dysphagia. These patients often may be diagnosed incorrectly as having gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional disease, given the paucity of objective endoscopy and radiographic findings in some patients, even though symptoms often are severe and persistent. A careful history with attention to detail and a compilation of compatible characteristics is key to the clinician's diagnosing eosinophilic esophagitis in an adult.

### Update on esophagitis: controversial and underdiagnosed causes [^111Px3HW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Esophagitis is a common cause of symptoms for which patients seek the advice of a physician. Esophagitis of differing etiologies often demonstrate overlapping histopathologic features, making their distinction difficult. This is especially true in esophageal disorders associated with increased numbers of intraepithelial eosinophils, some of which have just recently been recognized.

Objective

This review discusses the important clinical and pathologic features of the 2 most common disorders associated with esophageal eosinophilic infiltrates — reflux esophagitis and eosinophilic esophagitis — with special emphasis on features that allow the surgical pathologist to distinguish between these disorders. The various forms of drug-induced esophagitis are also discussed because these are frequently underrecognized by pathologists.

Data Sources

Data were extracted from articles identified through PubMed-based research. Histologic figures have been taken from the personal case collection of the author.

Conclusions

Reflux and eosinophilic esophagitis demonstrate overlapping histologic features, which may make their distinction difficult. Drug-induced esophagitis is probably a common phenomenon but is underrecognized by pathologists.

Results

Main recommendations provided by the EoExpert panel are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Summary of EoExpert panel's recommendations with level of agreement.

Diagnostic pathway

The median overall diagnostic delay of EoE is approximately 3 years in the Italian children's population. The non-specificity of symptoms in childhood often leads to them not being perceived as alarming by families or clinicians, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis and unawareness of diagnostic guidelines for EoE. Additionally, clinical presentations in young children are filtered and reported by caregivers, which can further complicate accurate diagnosis. In young adolescents and adults, this is further complicated by the development of instinctive adaptive behaviors that can effectively mask the disease, delaying suspicion of EoE until symptoms become clinically relevant. Moreover, symptoms of EoE may overlap with other conditions, such as GERD, making it difficult for clinicians to clearly identify it. These behaviors include imbibing fluids with meals, modifying foods, prolonging mealtimes, avoiding textured foods, chewing excessively, and turning away medicines such as tablets or pills, as widely reported in Table 2.

Table 2.
Eating behaviors in pediatric EoE patients.

To improve early diagnosis and assess the effectiveness of treatment for EoE, experts also recommend implementing the I.M.P. A.C.T. assess using a targeted 10-question tool designed to uncover adaptive behaviors that may be masking the underlying EoE condition (Table 3). –

### Italian eoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^114tbDCr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

According to what has been stated by EoEtaly panel expert opinion (statements #1 and #13), the chronic esophageal manifestation of EoE could progress from an inflammatory to a fibrostenotic phenotype, if not promptly diagnosed and effectively treated.

EoExperts highlight that EoE should not be considered as an episodic disease but, rather, a chronic and progressive disorder whose manifestations occasionally involve different organs, including the esophagus. This consequentially requires a continuous systemic therapeutic approach rather than intermittent therapy (i.e. cycling or stacking). Monitoring not only peak eosinophil count but also degranulated eosinophils, even though until now there is no consensus on using this biomarker. Nevertheless, mainly for the unjustified fear of long-term side effects related to conventional therapies, in EoExperts' experience, continuous treatments are not widely adopted in common clinical practice, which represents a limit for proper EoE care. However, similarly to what is confirmed by the literature, EoExperts recommend the adoption of continuous therapeutic protocols capable of guaranteeing prolonged histological remission, an essential condition for reducing the development of stenosis and food impaction over time. As also Starling et al. recently remarked, patients who achieved periods of histologic remission and lower esophageal eosinophil counts (< 15 eos/hpf) were associated with both lower rates of long-term fibrostenotic outcomes and reduced risk of food impaction. Moreover, it has been reported that the timing of diagnosis can be a great determining factor for the possibility of developing complications: younger age at diagnosis was, in fact, associated with lower rates of stricture formation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^111Z8mXp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary and conclusion

It is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6 years both in children and adults, and this is probably because initial manifestations of the disease may be overlooked. Early detection depends on the recognition of age-dependent characteristics that can also influence treatment. We have reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE, pointing out differences and similarities between children and adults to help guide clinical practice.

To summarize, early detection in children may be hampered by inadequate communicative skills, thus EoE should always be investigated in those with aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. In older adolescents and adults, dysphagia to solids, food impaction, and heartburn are the most common symptoms. Allergic diathesis supports clinical suspicion. An EGD with biopsies should be performed as the first step. On endoscopy, children have an inflammatory-predominant pattern, while adults usually have a fibrostenotic pattern. Since EoE has a patchy nature, at least six esophageal biopsies should be collected, selecting areas of mucosal abnormalities. In those with normal endoscopic appearance and typical symptoms, random biopsy sampling is warranted. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis should always be ruled out.

Therapeutic interventions should aim to induce histologic remission, relieve symptoms, and prevent or treat complications. Drugs, dietary regimens, and EDs may be offered as first-line treatments, and are interchangeable over time and could be combined.

Off-label use of PPIs is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. Topical corticosteroids reduce esophageal inflammation and remodeling; however, data on their clinical efficacy are conflicting. Long-term adverse effects and optimal maintenance dosages have not been assessed yet; however, dose reduction demonstrated efficacy both in children and adults, and adverse events are usually mild. Unlike drugs, dietary restrictions represent effective nonpharmacological therapy, practically devoid of adverse effects. Diets with amino-acidic formulas are effective both in children and adults, but the clinical application is hampered by procedural complexities, costs, and scarce compliance. The target elimination diet is poorly effective and not recommended in EoE. A 2–4–6 FED step-up approach may have better chances of clinical application, being less restrictive. Symptoms do not always improve hand in hand with mucosal healing, and anti-inflammatory or dietary therapy may not be effective when strictures or fixed rings develop; in such cases, EDs represent an effective treatment.

Infectious esophagitis is the third most common cause of esophagitis after gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and should always be considered in the differential of patients with dysphagia and odynophagia. The most common organisms causing disease are candida, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is well recognized that an impaired local or systemic immune system is a risk factor for disease; however, esophageal dysmotility and disruptions in esophageal homeostasis and the esophageal milieu are likely to represent additional risk factors in disease pathogenesis.

Tailoring treatment to each patient's specific needs based on factors like age, symptom severity, and comorbidities is crucial. This consideration should encompass current therapeutic approaches and novel biologic therapies displaying promising efficacy and patient safety. Regular follow-ups and monitoring are equally essential to assess treatment effectiveness, identify potential complications, or make necessary therapy adjustments. This study had two main limitations. First, there is a significant lack of evidence in the literature concerning the epidemiology and management of EoE in Italy. To address this gap, a survey was administered, although expert opinion cannot fully compensate for the absence of context-specific epidemiological studies. Second, despite being administered to EoE disorder experts, the survey was influenced by the inherent subjectivity of their responses, representing a second limitation of this study. Moreover, in addressing the limitations of our study, it is important to note that the survey was administered to a highly heterogeneous group of physicians. This diversity, while enriching the breadth of perspectives collected, also introduces a limitation as the survey did not investigate in depth the specific training physicians received on EoE, their experience in managing EoE patients, and the duration of their engagement in this field. Acknowledging this, our findings may not fully reflect the nuanced understanding and approaches that vary with different levels of expertise and experience in EoE management. Additionally, the number of respondents in the current study is relatively low, which may further limit the generalizability of our findings. Future studies could benefit from a more detailed exploration of these aspects and consider including a larger pool of respondents to better understand their impact on the management of EoE and to enhance the robustness and applicability of the results.

### Italian eoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^112mpRHW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EoE, as the Italian EoExpert Panel recommends, has to be considered a chronic, progressive esophageal manifestation of a type 2 systemic inflammatory disorder, with occasional manifestations involving different organs. Timely diagnosis still remains a critical unmet need in EoE management for both the adult and pediatric populations. It has been demonstrated that the risk of developing fibrostenosis, the main complication related to the progression of EoE, increases by 5% for each year of diagnostic delay, representing a critical global element for health and QoL of these patients.

With the aim of both addressing unmet needs and gathering insights to standardize EoE patient care across Italy, the Italian EoExpert panel has analyzed all the clinical and management aspects of the disease, with particular focus on accuracy and timing of diagnosis, therapy, disease evolution, and long-term follow-up. Due to its chronic and progressive nature, EoE requires careful lifelong management. The literature review and the subsequent 21-item survey administered to EoExpert allowed to validate 13-recommendation guidelines within a specific EoE care algorithm, providing a support tool for the standardization of management in pediatric and adult EoE settings.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in children and adults [^115Mnu57]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Adults and children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have distinct clinical and endoscopic presentations. Recognition of clinical signs, along with laboratory and endoscopic findings, is critical for the identification of patients with EoE because delay in diagnosis has been associated with esophageal remodeling and stricture formation. Clinical presentation varies considerably between adults and children. This is less due to differences in the disease and more due to patient differences. This article describes the similarities and differences in clinical presentation of children and adults with EoE, including areas of epidemiology, clinical and endoscopic presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^115mCfR2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the incidence and prevalence of EoE were believed to be rare prior to the past two decades, they have sharply increased over yearsand now constitute a prevalent disease, with rates comparable to Crohn's disease. Notably, several population-based studies from the United States, and Europe, have provided evidence of a true increase, rather than a mere increase in recognition or biopsy rate.

EoE is considered the most frequent eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder. The estimated incidence in adults and children is 7.0 and 5.1 per 100,000/year, respectively; the estimated overall pooled prevalence is 22.7/100,000; it is higher in adults (32.5/100,000) than in children (19.1/100,000). EoE is more common in males, with a 3:1 male to female ratio at all age groups. The peak incidence is between 20 and 40 years of age. Up to 22% of patients undergoing upper endoscopy for non-obstructive dysphagia, and over 50% of patients referred for food impaction receive a diagnosis of EoE. Most patients have co-occurring allergic rhinitis, asthma, IgE-mediated food allergies and atopic dermatitis, and children show higher hypersensitivity against food antigens.

Symptoms vary according to the age of diagnosis. Non-specific symptoms affect children, while dysphagia and food impaction are predominant in adults. Endoscopic features change from childhood to adulthood; this is because chronic inflammation drives a progressive fibrosis and esophageal remodeling.

Treatment options include drugs (Table 1), and dietary and endoscopic interventions. Approaches depend on clinical features and the age of patients, but also reflect on the preferences of the recruiting center.

### The clinical impact of conventional therapies for adults and adolescents suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis, a type 2 inflammatory chronic disease, and their economic consequences in Italy: systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112CvDKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Some points of strength should also be highlighted. To our knowledge, the present analysis is the most updated (from any date up to December 31, 2023) and comprehensive literature review on the role of PPIs and TCSs in the management of patients with EoE aged 12 years or older. The inclusion of observational studies, rather than RCTs only, permitted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments also in a real-life setting. Despite some difference in the magnitude of the estimated effects, RCTs and observational studies agreed for almost all outcomes. Finally, on the basis of the bias assessment, the overall quality of the included studies (both RCTs and observational studies) was high.

This systematic review provides valuable insights into the efficacy, safety, and economic impact of TCS and PPI treatment in EoE. TCS treatment emerged as the primary choice for achieving HR and ER, whereas PPI treatment showed efficacy in reducing symptoms. The study highlights the need for standardized treatment guidelines because of the heterogeneity in treatment efficacy across different studies and the existence of a significant unmet need that could be fulfilled by new biologic therapies as anti–IL-4 and IL-13. However, on the basis of the available studies, it must be acknowledged that heterogeneity in both eligibility criteria and outcome measures hampers the establishment of a solid therapeutic hierarchy in EoE. Because of the low representativeness of adolescents, generalization on patients aged 12 to 17 years could raise some concerns. Future research and the introduction of new therapies may offer opportunities to optimize treatment outcomes and health care costs in EoE management, ultimately improving patient QoL.

### Pooled phase 2 and 3 efficacy and safety data on budesonide oral suspension in adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis [^1136RckJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, compared with placebo, 12 weeks of BOS therapy substantially improved histologic, endoscopic, and clinicopathologic (histologic and symptom) responses in adolescent patients with EoE. These improvements were similar to those observed for the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies that enrolled patients with EoE aged 11–40 and 11–55 years, respectively, highlighting the reproducibility and consistency of these findings in adolescents. A numerical improvement in dysphagia symptom response was observed in BOS-treated compared with placebo-treated patients. This improvement was not statistically significant, emphasizing the established discordance between histologic and symptom reporting in patients with EoE. BOS was well tolerated in this population, with all TEAEs being mild or moderate in severity. Importantly, this is the first pooled analysis examining adolescent patients with EoE treated with BOS, providing unique insights into the efficacy and safety of BOS in patients aged 11–17 years with EoE.

### Evidence-based treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis: insights for the clinician [^113hFnBD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

EoE is a young disease, the first cases being described in the 1970s and 1980s as a particular form of eosinophilic gastroenteritis with esophageal involvement. – These early cases established the frequent association of EoE with atopy, subsequently defined as a landmark of the disease, that involves a Th2 immune reaction to food and/or aeroallergens in its pathophysiology:Most patients with EoE also present with a personal and/or family history of several atopic manifestations, which are well recognized as a factor in the appearance of the disease.

The first characterization of EoE as a distinctive clinico-pathological syndrome, different from eosinophilic gastroenteritis, was proposed less than three decades ago, and the number of cases reported across all continents has sharply expanded since then, with most cases being diagnosed in Europe and North America. Currently, EoE represents the most common cause of chronic or recurrent esophageal symptoms after gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is the leading cause of dysphagia in children and young adults in developed countries, with, according to several studies, a prevalence that exceeds 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. As a result, EoE now represents a chronic common health problem in gastroenterology and allergy clinics, and a significant burden on health care systems, in which a well-recognized diagnostic delay, the need for endoscopy with biopsies to diagnose the disease and monitor the response to treatments, and the costs of therapies are estimated to be $2300 per year in the United States. This increases considerably, up to $4001 per year, in pediatric patients, far exceeding the cost of care of Crohn's and celiac diseases.

The expanding epidemiology of EoE has allowed the development of multiple trials and meta-analyses to identify effective therapies. These include dietary interventions to target the allergic nature of EoE, several drugs with anti-inflammatory effectiveness, and endoscopic dilation to provide symptom relief in patients with esophageal strictures or narrow caliber esophagi and persistent dysphagia/food impaction, despite effective anti-inflammatory treatment. Intense research efforts are being undertaken to provide treatment options to the proportion of patients who are still unable to have their disease controlled with current therapeutic options. Several consensus documents and clinical practice guidelines released during the last decade,– have provided a structured and evidence-based framework for treating patients with EoE, trying to maximize the results of available therapies. However, substantial variations in adherence to guidelines regarding treatment choice and assessment of response have been documented, – which has limited assessment of the effectiveness of the different interventions available for EoE.

### Psychometric evaluation of the dysphagia symptom questionnaire for adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis [^115j3TVE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the esophagus leading to symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; dysphagia is the most common symptom experienced by adults and adolescents.

Objective

We sought to perform a psychometric evaluation of the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), a patient-reported outcome measure for patients with EoE.

Methods

Using baseline and week 24 data from the randomized, interventional, multinational phase 3 R668-EE-1774 trial (NCT03633617), the measurement properties of the DSQ — including reliability, construct and known-groups validity, responsiveness, and interpretation of change — were evaluated.

Results

The analysis population comprised 239 patients with EoE (age [mean ± SD], 28.1 ± 13.14 years; 63.6% male; 90.4% White). Intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.97 exceeded the acceptable reliability threshold (≥ 0.70). Construct validity correlations with EoE symptom and impact measures were moderate at baseline (| r | = 0.44–0.55) and week 24 (| r | = 0.55–0.69), and the DSQ biweekly total score discriminated among groups defined by disease severity. Analyses exploring interpretation of change from baseline on the DSQ biweekly total score indicated thresholds for within-patient improvement ranging from 9 to 23 points; a within-patient improvement from baseline of 13 points or greater could be considered clinically meaningful.

Conclusions

This analysis confirmed that the DSQ has acceptable distributional properties, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and ability to detect change. Therefore, the DSQ is a valid and reliable measure to assess the patient-reported symptom of dysphagia among adult and adolescent patients with EoE in the context of a clinical trial setting.

Here you will find the latest clinical guidance for eosinophilic esophagitis, including signs and symptoms, diagnostic considerations, medications and treatment, referral considerations and additional resources to use for educating patients and families. We have also provided an EoE visual library, as well as a detailed treatment algorithm. Eosinophilic Esophagitis Overview Eosinophilic Esophagitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by a Th2-type response that leads to chronic, eosinophil-predominant, inflammation of the esophagus. This chronic inflammation, when untreated, can cause esophageal remodeling, odynophagia and food impaction. EoE is the most common cause of persistent dysphagia in developed countries. Although the first case was reported in 1978, EoE was not identified as a unique disease entity until the early 1990s. Since then, the increase in incidence of EoE has exceeded that which can be attributed to increasing recognition alone.

There is no known single cause but it is believed to be caused by environmental factors possibly combined with genetic predisposition as a major driver of disease prevalence. In the United States, estimates of annual costs attributable to the treatment of patients with EoE approach 1. 4 billion dollars. Symptoms in children are variable and can include dysphagia, epigastric pain, vomiting and food impaction. Children with EoE may have subtle symptoms or adjust their mealtime habits to mitigate the more overt symptoms of choking and gagging, both of which can delay diagnosis.
- Adjustments may include excessive chewing of food, eating softer foods, eating smaller quantities and drinking frequently during meals. The primary goal of intervention is to treat the underlying inflammation through identification of potential food triggers, the use of medication or both. Phenotypic subtypes may require different treatment approaches.

Clinical Information Below you will find clinical information and resources to help care for children with EoE including risk factors, signs and symptoms and treatment options.

### Italian eoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^111cnZDc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This panel expert opinion paper provides a useful insight for a more standardized approach in the management of EoE, from pediatrics to adults. The importance of a timely and accurate diagnosis is the key point in planning proper disease management. Evaluation of control in EoE should be carried out in a multidisciplinary context, adopting a multidimensional and holistic approach, which considers and integrates aspects related to QoL, symptoms, adaptive behaviors as well as an adequate endoscopic and histological evaluation. Being a chronic progressive type 2 inflammatory condition, EoE requires lifelong management and continuous treatment which, in conclusion, can only benefit from adequate care standardization and disease awareness.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- EoE is characterized by symptoms of dysphagia and/or food impaction in adult patients with esophageal histology showing a peak eosinophil count of ≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf, or ≥ 15 eosinophils/0.3 mm² or > 60 eosinophils/mm² in the absence of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia

- EoE responding clinically and histologically to a PPI is the same disease as EoE not responding to a PPI

- EoE and GERD are not mutually exclusive and can coexist in the same patient

- EoE is increasing in prevalence in both adults and children

- EoE is more common in males than females and in people of white ethnic origin compared with other ethnic groups

- having an affected first-degree relative increases the risk of EoE

- the incidence rises during adolescence and peaks in early adulthood

- there is seasonal variation in the symptoms of EoE in many patients, which seems to be associated with higher pollen counts

- food bolus obstruction and dysphagia are strongly associated with a diagnosis of EoE in adult patients

- EoE is the most common cause of spontaneous perforation of the esophagus and this can occur at any age.

Rationale for the registry

Almost four decades after its first descriptions, EoE remains full of pathophysiological, epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic uncertainties. EoE is currently recognized as the most common cause of chronic or recurrent esophageal symptoms, after gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and it is the leading cause of dysphagia in children and young adults in Europe and North America, with a prevalence that exceeds 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to several studies. Lately, EoE has also emerged as a disorder with increasing frequency in other regions, such as North Africa, Central and South America, and Asia. As a result, EoE now represents a chronic common health problem, which implies a significant impairment in the quality of life of patients suffering from it. Figure 1 summarizes the prevalence estimates for EoE according to the results of a recent systematic review with meta-analysis.

Figure 1.
Prevalence rates for EoE with 95% confidence intervals (CIs; in patients per 100,000 inhabitants), resulting from meta-analyses of individual studies grouped according to the diagnostic criteria for EoE used in each study.

In addition, EoE represents a significant burden on the health care systems, due to the diagnostic delay, the need for endoscopy with biopsies to diagnose the disease and monitor the response to treatments, and the costs of new drugs. The mean annual cost per patient attributable to EoE in the United States has been estimated to be US$2300 per yearand increases considerably in pediatric patients up to $4001 per year, far exceeding the cost of care of Crohn's disease (US$985) and celiac disease (US$856).

### Eosinophilic esophagitis [^114iBWoR]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory disease of the esophagus that effects children and adults. Typical symptoms of EoE typically involve failure to thrive and vomiting in small children, and dysphagia and food impaction in adolescents and adults. However, throat clearing, choking, gagging, and hoarseness have also been observed and these issues often bring patients to first seek otolaryngology and pulmonary evaluation. Diagnosis is only made by esophogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, so clinicians must have a low threshold for considering eosinophilic esophagitis even in the absence of frank gastrointestinal symptoms.

### The clinical impact of conventional therapies for adults and adolescents suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis, a type 2 inflammatory chronic disease, and their economic consequences in Italy: systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^113M8BhP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory esophageal disease. The primary symptoms include dysphagia and food impaction in adolescents and adults. Even though EoE is still somewhat new as a condition, its prevalence in Western countries has been steadily increasing in the last 2 decades, and, as a consequence, it is nowadays recognized as an ordinary disease in clinical practice. EoE has been associated with potential severe clinical consequences, including esophageal stenosis and perforation. Moreover, EoE has a very negative impact on the health-related quality of life (QoL) of patients because long-term avoidance of the foods that trigger EoE, which is a main pillar in maintaining drug-free disease remission, places a psychological burden that can result in stress and anxiety.

First guidelines for EoE were published in 2007and then updated in 2011. On the basis of these guidelines, EoE diagnosis was defined according to the following criteria: (1) clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; (2) 15 or more eosinophil granulocytes per hpf (eos/hpf) on esophageal biopsies; (3) lack of responsiveness to high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial (up to 2 mg/kg/d); and (4) exclusion of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia (ie, systemic diseases). Because of this, subsequent diagnostic guidelines defined a new condition termed PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) for patients with criteria 1 and 2, but improvement or resolution of symptoms and eosinophilia after a high-dose PPI trial. Starting from 2018, the PPI trial requirement was removed because of similarities between EoE and PPI-REE in terms of clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings. Updated versions of the guidelines were published in 2017and 2024.

### Savary dilation is safe and effective treatment for esophageal narrowing related to pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis [^116AVnXz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

What Is Known
Esophageal narrowing is an uncommon complication of eosinophilic esophagitis.
The esophageal mucosa in eosinophilic esophagitis is prone to tears.

What Is New
Savary dilation is safe in the management of eosinophilic esophagitis-associated esophageal narrowing.
The high incidence of esophageal narrowing indicates that esophageal narrowing is not an uncommon complication in longstanding, untreated pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis.
The high consanguinity rate among children with eosinophilic esophagitis-associated esophageal narrowing may indicate that a subset of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis who have a genetic predisposition to stricture formation.
Dilation alone does not improve the inflammatory process, and hence a combination with dietary or medical intervention is required.

Esophageal narrowing resulting from eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) presents significant management challenges. The esophageal mucosa in EOE is fragile and prone to extensive esophageal mucosal tears following esophageal dilation, so-called crepe-paper mucosa. There are a number of reports describing spontaneous esophageal perforations and perforations caused by instrumentation of the esophagus in patients with EoE. Cohen et al, in an audit study, reported complications in 31% and a perforation rate of 8%, associated with endoscopy and dilation of esophageal narrowing in adults with EoE. These reports were extremely concerning and raised the question of whether dilation should be considered as a treatment strategy in EoE. This is in striking contrast to a single perforation following 486 dilations for esophageal peptic strictures (0.2%). Hence, gastroenterologists have been cautioned that patients with EoE may be exceptionally predisposed to perforation with esophageal dilation.

Esophageal narrowing complicating EoE is more frequently encountered among adults with EoE compared with children, therefore the vast majority of the data on EoE-associated esophageal narrowing and its management came from adult studies. There is scanty data on the frequency of esophagus narrowing among children with EoE, and including the management options of this complication. Details on how to deal with this complication were reported in only 2 small cases series that described 6 adolescents; esophageal stenosis was dilated using balloon dilator in 4 cases and bougie dilator in 2, without reports of complications. In light of the scarcity of data, the recommendations of an EoE-expert group from North America and Europe on management of EoE-associated esophageal narrowing in children indicate that the optimal role of dilation as therapy of EoE is still controversial and that dilation should only be tried in highly selected cases with severe esophageal narrowing unresponsive to other forms of treatment.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114JCv8Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic type 2 antigen‐mediated inflammatory disorder of the esophagus, causing upper gastrointestinal symptoms and characterized by increased esophageal infiltration with intraepithelial eosinophils (Liacouras 2011; Rothenberg 2015). It was originally described during the 1970s in adults with symptoms of esophagitis, who often had allergies, and who had high esophageal eosinophil counts. The diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis are clinical symptoms of esophageal disease, a histological abnormality of 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high‐power field (hpf) on endoscopy, the exclusion of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and consistent endoscopic findings (Furuta 2007). Eosinophilic esophagitis affects young infants to adults. In young children, the symptoms may be associated with feeding difficulties, vomiting, weight loss, and abdominal pain, however dysphagia and food impaction occur more often among teenagers and adults (Croese 2003; Liacouras 1998; Liacouras 2011; Orenstein 2000). In eosinophilic esophagitis, the mucosa may look normal macroscopically, however thickening, ringing, furrowing, and erosion have been reported (Dellon 2018; Furuta 2015; Hassall 1996; Khan 2003; Orenstein 2000).

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic infiltrate (≥ 15/hpf) in the esophageal epithelium and the absence of other potential causes of eosinophilia. The prevalence is increasing and is the most common cause of solid food dysphagia in children and young adults. This article will review the diagnosis and management of EoE based on consensus conferences, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis and highlights seminal studies in our evolving treatment of this disease. However, all answers are not available and I will remark about the lessons learned in my clinical practice seeing EoE patients over the last 25 years. The complicated etiology of the complaint of dysphagia in EoE patients will be reviewed. The importance of utilizing endoscopy, biopsies, and barium esophagram to help define the 2 phenotypes (inflammatory, fibrostenosis) of EoE will be highlighted. The controversy about PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia will be discussed and contrasted with idiopathic EoE. Finally, the 3 treatment options for EoE (drugs, diet, dilation) will be reviewed in detail and a useful clinical management algorithm presented.

Results

Physician characteristics

Overall, 126 gastroenterologists and 60 allergists/immunologists contributed 411 patient medical charts in total; 399 charts met the study eligibility criteria and were included. Each physician contributed an average (interquartile range (IQR)) of 2.2 (1.0, 3.0) charts. Physicians had spent a mean (SD) duration of 13.2 (7.3) years treating adolescent and/or adult patients with EoE and had treated a median (IQR) of 5.0 (0.0, 15.0) adolescent patients and 25.0 (10.0, 50.0) adult patients with EoE overall. Most physicians worked in a private practice (71.5% (133/186)), an academic hospital (21.5% (40/186)), or a nonacademic hospital (5.9% (11/186)); the four regions of the USA were well represented.

Patient baseline demographics and clinical characteristics

Overall, 74 adolescents (11–17 years old) and 325 adults (at least 18 years old) with EoE were included in this study. The mean (SD) age of adolescents and adults was 14.9 (1.8) and 32.9 (11.0) years, respectively; most patients were male (adolescents: 71.6%; adults: 74.5%) and White (adolescents: 75.7%; adults: 81.2%; Table 1). Most patients had at least one comorbidity, of which the most frequently reported in adolescents and adults were allergic rhinitis (50.0% and 31.7%, respectively) and asthma (41.9% and 33.8%, respectively; Table 1). The presence of allergic rhinitis and food allergy in adults increased significantly with increased EoE disease severity (p < 0.05).

### 14 years of eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical features and prognosis [^117RXDPE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the natural history of treated and untreated eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) and examine the presenting symptoms of EE.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective and prospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with EE at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. EE was defined as greater than 20 eosinophils per high power field after treatment with reflux medications.

Results

We identified 620 patients in our database in the last 14 years and 330 patients with greater than 1 year of follow-up for analysis. The number of new EE patients has increased on an annual basis. Of the patients presenting with EE, 68% were younger than 6 years old. Reflux symptoms and feeding issues/failure to thrive were the most common presenting symptoms for EE. Eleven patients had resolution of all of their food allergies and 33 patients had resolutions of some of their food allergies. No patients have progression of EE into other gastrointestinal disorders.

Conclusions

EE is a chronic disease with less than 10% of the population developing tolerance to their food allergies. EE does not progress into other gastrointestinal diseases.

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis from the European pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis registry (pEEr) of ESPGHAN [^1134MvZV]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Few pediatric data on phenotypic aspects of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are available. The pEEr registry was developed to prospectively characterize children with EoE from Europe and Israel.

Methods

pEEr is an ongoing prospective registry enrolling children with esophageal eosinophilia (≥ 15 eos/HPF). Anonymized data were collected from 19 pediatric centers. Data regarding demographics, clinical manifestations, endoscopy, histology, and therapies were collected.

Results

A total of 582 subjects (61% male) were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 10.5 years [interquartile range (IQR): 5.7–17.7], whereas the age at symptom onset was 9.2 years (IQR: 4.3–16.4), resulting in a median diagnostic delay of 1.2 years (IQR: 0.7–2.3). The diagnostic delay was longer below age < 6 years. Shorter diagnostic delays were associated with the presence of food allergy or a family history for EoE. Symptoms varied by age with dysphagia and food impaction more common in adolescents, while vomiting and failure to thrive more common in younger children (P < 0.001). Among endoscopic findings, esophageal rings were more common in adolescents, whereas exudates were more frequent in younger children(P < 0.001). Patients who responded to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were more likely to be older, males, and less often presented severe endoscopic findings. Patients unresponsive to PPIs received topical steroids (40%), elimination diet (41%), or a combined therapy (19%).

Conclusions

EoE findings vary according to age in pediatric EoE. Young children are commonly characterized by non-specific symptoms, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and inflammatory endoscopic lesions. Adolescents usually have dysphagia or food impaction, fibrostenotic lesions, and a better PPI response.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1166XFMP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis — symptoms across ages and diagnostic considerations: For the first step, symptoms vary by age; in adolescents and adults, dysphagia and food impaction are most common, although heartburn and chest pain can be present as well, while in infants and young children, poor growth, failure to thrive, feeding intolerance, failure to progress to solid foods, increased time needed for eating, or food refusal can be seen, and in school-aged children, abdominal pain, vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn are common. All symptoms of EoE are non-specific and have a broad differential diagnosis, and special attention should be paid when eliciting symptoms of dysphagia because patients can use food avoidance and modification behaviors to minimize these symptoms over long periods, leading to diagnostic delays.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^117TbbqD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another diagnostic challenge in identifying EoE involves the inappropriate use of endoscopy. Although endoscopy might not be sensitive enough to detect EoE, it remains the most used diagnostic tool. For instance, Oude Nijhuis et al. assessed the diagnostic efficacy of routine esophageal biopsies in individuals experiencing refractory reflux symptoms. Among 301 enrolled patients, only 4.7% met clinicopathological diagnostic criteria for EoE. Notably, factors like dysphagia, food bolus impaction, an atopic background, and typical endoscopic features exhibited the strongest associations and diagnostic accuracy for EoE. However, in patients lacking symptoms of dysphagia or relevant endoscopic features, the diagnostic yield was minimal, at 0% and 1.9%, respectively. The study suggests that routine esophageal biopsy sampling in individuals with refractory reflux symptoms has low diagnostic yield and recommends selectively obtaining esophageal biopsies, focusing on patients with refractory reflux symptoms accompanied by dysphagia for a more targeted and clinically meaningful diagnostic approach. Interpretation of biopsy results may also pose challenges, as patient-reported symptoms may not consistently align with histological activity. Therefore, the standard diagnostic threshold is defined as ⩾15 eosinophils in at least one high-power field. Additional histological features integrated into the EoE histologic scoring system support diagnosis and aid in evaluating inflammatory activity during follow-up. Consequently, reaching the correct diagnosis can often be difficult, leading to diagnostic delays. Factors contributing to these delays include delayed referral to gastroenterologists, postponed esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and inadequate biopsy collection or histopathologic evaluation.

Discussion

While the first case of EoE was reported in 1970, the disease, as recognized today, was described in only three cases in the early 1990s. Although EoE has been considered a rare condition, it remains a significant cause of morbidity in the upper gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased healthcare costs. The exact causes of EoE are not completely understood but are believed to be linked to genetic, environmental, and immune factors. Despite being relatively new, the incidence of EoE is on the rise globally, with reports of 1–34 new cases per 100,000 people per year.

Diagnosing EoE can be challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms and the absence of specific biomarkers. Diagnostic tools currently available are not sensitive enough to detect it. A major issue for EoE is diagnostic delay, with an average time from the first symptom to the final diagnosis being 10 years. Factors such as patient-dependent issues and misdiagnosis contribute to this delay, leading to increased EoE severity. In cases where patients report minimal symptoms, clinicians should explore dietary and adaptive behavioral or modifications, such as eating slowly, thorough chewing before swallowing, drinking fluids to aid swallowing, and avoiding solid foods. These adjustments help patients adapt to the reduced esophageal distensibility. However, enhancing our understanding of EoE's natural progression and refining clinical management will reduce diagnostic delays and optimize patient care pathways. Incorporating red flags into patient evaluations can enhance EoE diagnosis and management. Essential red flags involve taking the patient's initial history and ruling out other potential confounding conditions. Raising awareness among primary care physicians, often the first point of contact for patients with EoE symptoms, is the primary step. Subsequently, an optimal patient journey necessitates a multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterologists, allergists, pathologists, and dietitians. Upon diagnosis, patients should be referred to specialists capable of performing endoscopies and biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate disease severity. Therefore, assessing EoE severity requires a multidisciplinary approach, considering clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, histological evaluations, patient-reported outcomes, and emerging biomarkers. Integrating these factors offers a comprehensive understanding of individual patients' EoE severity, aiding treatment decisions and monitoring disease progression.

### Pooled phase 2 and 3 efficacy and safety data on budesonide oral suspension in adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis [^115YbvDq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa, defined as ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf). EoE can affect patients across a wide age range, and common symptoms include feeding intolerance or aversion, vomiting, heartburn, and regurgitation in children, as well as food impaction and, most commonly, dysphagia in adolescents and adults. Adding to the complexity of EoE presentation, symptoms are nonspecific and may not directly correlate with disease severity, and there are no established pathognomonic symptoms of EoE in children and adolescents. The rapidly increasing prevalence of EoE, estimated at approximately 34.2 cases per 100,000 people globally, represents a growing health problem that poses a significant burden for health care systems. The prevalence of EoE is slightly higher in children and adolescents (aged < 16 years; 38.3 cases per 100,000 [USA/Canada]) than in adults (aged ≥ 18 years; 31.9 cases per 100,000 [USA/Canada]).

Despite the increasing prevalence of EoE, there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved swallowed topical corticosteroid for the treatment of EoE. Management strategies are typically limited to off-label use of swallowed topical corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), or elimination diets. As off-label pharmacologic therapies are not specifically optimized for esophageal delivery, they may provide inadequate treatment in patients with EoE. Few studies to date have examined the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids in pediatric or adolescent populations with EoE.

Budesonide oral suspension (BOS) is a novel, immediate-release, topical corticosteroid optimized as a viscous suspension for patients with EoE, with the aim of lengthening residency time at the esophageal mucosal surface after swallowing. The efficacy and safety of BOS 2.0 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) were previously established in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 and phase 3 studies in adolescents and adults with EoE (aged 11–40 years [phase 2] and 11–55 years [phase 3]).

To improve our understanding of the specific response of late-childhood and adolescent patients to BOS, a pooled post hoc analysis from these 2 completed clinical studies was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BOS 2.0 mg b.i.d. in patients aged 11–17 years with EoE over 12 weeks versus placebo.

### Assessment of real-world disease severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States [^114yXtKj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the growing prevalence and understanding of EoE, disease severity is not typically reported in clinical practice. In this retrospective study, physician-assessed EoE disease severity, based on clinical severity and markers of severity, indicated that fewer than 10% of adolescents and adults with EoE had severe disease. Overall, the physician-assessed EoE disease severity was generally higher than the adapted I-SEE-assessed severity, considering the differences observed between mild and moderate disease severity. Presence of symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histopathology reports were most frequently used by physicians to assess EoE disease severity. The duration between the first symptom and the index date, the number of treatment lines received by patients, and certain HCRU increased with increasing EoE disease severity.

The symptoms of EoE are nonspecific, which often leads to delayed diagnosis. In this study, the mean (SD) duration from the first EoE symptom to the index date was shorter in adolescents (11.3 (16.1) months) than in adults (17.4 (31.8) months). It took patients with more severe EoE significantly longer to receive a diagnosis following the first symptom presentation compared with patients with less severe EoE; this finding should prompt earlier medical intervention following symptom onset. However, these data align with the current understanding of EoE disease progression; persistent, untreated eosinophil-predominant inflammation can lead to fibrostenosis and tissue remodeling, resulting in exacerbated esophageal dysfunction and a more severe presentation. – These findings could suggest a lack of awareness of the natural history of EoE among physicians in the US, or that physicians may not be fully aware of patients' symptoms, perhaps as a result of dietary elimination and adaptive behaviors. The presence of some symptoms was found to increase with increasing EoE disease severity, so it can also be hypothesized that patients with more severe EoE may have been misdiagnosed or may have delayed seeking medical advice from their provider, owing to increased symptom tolerance, or the presence of symptoms that were not disease-specific.

### Management of eosinophilic esophagitis-AAP… [^112mr2XB]. AAP (2023). Medium credibility.

EoE is a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment. The goals of treatment are to:

- Decrease eosinophilic inflammation
- Alleviate symptoms
- Prevent disease progression
- Prevent disease complications)
- Support normal development and psychological adjustment Treating children with EoE involves diet therapy and/or medical therapy. Children with strictures and food impaction that do not improve with medical and/or diet therapy may require dilation. A multi-center, retrospective study drawing from a European database of patients with EoE demonstrated that clinical and histologic remission or response occurred in 82% of patients taking topical steroids, 69% of patients taking proton pump inhibitors, and 42% of patients on empirical elimination diets. Dietary Therapy For many children, EoE is a non-IgE-mediated allergic disease, thus removal of relevant food allergens can cause remission of the disease.
- It is important to acknowledge that elimination diets can be difficult to adhere to and can decrease quality of life and possibly promote disordered eating.
- Early research demonstrated highest rates of remission with complete elemental diets followed by six-food elimination diets but these are also often unsustainable for long periods of time.
- Early research also evaluated the use of IgE skin prick or serologic tests to guide specific food elimination diets, but this is now considered outdated due to false positive results and inconsistency in identification of food triggers. Dietary therapy has 3 main approaches:

- Elemental diet
- Empirical food elimination
- Milk elimination Medical Therapy. Dilation When dietary or anti-inflammatory treatment are ineffective, children with EoE may develop esophageal strictures or stenosis. In some children, esophageal dilation may be necessary to prevent food impaction and pain.
- One retrospective study of 451 pediatric dilations showed that esophageal dilation has a low rate of serious adverse events that necessitate medical intervention; chest pain was reported in approximately 15% of children.
- Some strictures form in very young children with EoE. The youngest documented age at which stricture formation requiring dilation occurred in a child was 3 years.

### Validation of the novel eosinophilic esophagitis symptom questionnaire [^111Decne]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a type 2 inflammatory, chronic, and progressive disease that is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal epithelium. While EoE can develop at any age, it is most common in individuals over 30 years of age. Recent prevalence estimates have reported approximately 142.5 cases per 100,000 people in the United States, a rate that has been steadily increasing. Patients with EoE present with symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction. The predominant symptom among adult and adolescent patients is dysphagia, which can lead to food impaction. Patients may also experience a range of additional symptoms, including abdominal pain, chest pain, heartburn, regurgitation, and vomiting. Among adult and adolescent patients, these symptoms are reported less frequently compared with dysphagia but still contribute to the overall EoE disease burden and negatively affect patients' quality of life, substantially affecting patients' productivity, emotional well-being, and social activity. The chronic nature of EoE and the burden of symptoms on patients' lives highlight the need to evaluate the full symptom experience of EoE.

The Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure that has been developed with patient input and validated in clinical trials for evaluating dysphagia and associated pain while swallowing in adult and adolescent patients with EoE. Although the DSQ assesses the predominant symptom of EoE, it omits the broad range of additional EoE symptoms that both adult and adolescent patients with EoE may experience. As such, there is a need for a valid and reliable complementary PRO questionnaire measuring the full breadth of symptoms.

The Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score (EoE-SQ) was developed to measure the frequency and severity of EoE symptoms, beyond dysphagia and pain while swallowing, that are experienced by adult and adolescent patients. Initial development of the EoE-SQ involved a literature review, advisory meetings with clinical experts, and patient interviews. After this, the EoE-SQ was subsequently administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for adult and adolescent patients with EoE (R668-EE-1774; NCT03633617). The analysis aimed to estimate the psychometric measurement properties of the EoE-SQ and to determine thresholds for meaningful score changes on the basis of data from R668-EE-1774.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116mfcJn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the absence of secondary causes, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, local, progressive, T-helper type 2 immune-mediated disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. In the last 20years, the incidence and prevalence of EoE have risen sharply, and the chances of encountering affected patients in clinics and endoscopy rooms have increased. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6years in both children and adults. Unfortunately, the longer the disease stays unrecognized, the likelier it is for the patient to have persistent or increased esophageal eosinophilic inflammation, to complain of non-resolving symptoms, and to develop fibrotic complications. Early detection depends on the recognition of initial clinical manifestations that vary from childhood to adulthood and even among patients of the same age. The disease phenotype also influences therapeutic approaches that include drugs, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. We have herein reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE focusing on differences and similarities between children and adults that may certainly serve in daily clinical practice.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in children and adults [^114Yumbb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Children with eosinophilic esophagitis, an isolated, severe esophageal eosinophilia, present with symptoms similar to gastroesophageal reflux but do not experience response to aggressive antireflux therapy. Increasingly, eosinophilic esophagitis is considered to be a separate entity from reflux disease. Current theory suggests that the former may be caused by cell-mediated food hypersensitivity or may be a subset of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Reports support the efficacy of dietary restriction or corticosteroid therapy. Additional research is needed to determine etiology, allow earlier clinical recognition, and improve treatment.

### Childhood GERD is a risk factor for GERD in adolescents and young adults [^112yUDvD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The clinical course of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children without comorbid illness (neurological deficits, congenital esophageal anomalies, chronic obstructive airway conditions) is unclear. Whether GERD in childhood progresses or predisposes to GERD in adulthood remains unknown.

Methods

We identified a cohort of individuals endoscopically diagnosed with GERD in childhood between 1990 and 1996. We excluded patients with comorbid illnesses. Eligible persons were contacted by telephone in person or through a household member and requested to complete a validated (in adults) symptom questionnaire between February 2001 and February 2003. Respondents were invited to undergo an upper endoscopy or to share results of any endoscopic examination performed within the past 12 months. We calculated the proportion of persons with GERD symptoms (monthly, weekly), and with current use of antisecretory medications (histamine-2-receptor antagonists [H2RA], proton pump inhibitors [PPI]).

Results

A total of 207 persons satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were contacted. Of those, 80 (39%) completed the questionnaire and 14/80 (18%) had an upper endoscopy. The mean age of participants was 20 years (SD = 4, range 10–40); most were Caucasian (73%), and 60% were female. GERD was documented at a mean age of 5 years (approximately a 15-yr duration of follow-up). Most participants (64/80, 80%) had at least monthly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation reported within the past 12 months; 18/80 (23%) reported at least weekly symptoms, and an additional three patients were asymptomatic but taking antisecretory therapy (H2RA or PPI). If all nonresponders were considered free of symptoms, then at least 31% had monthly symptoms, and 9% had weekly symptoms. Overall, 24 (30%) were currently taking either H2RA or PPI, and 19 patients had undergone fundoplication. There were no statistically significant differences between those who reported monthly GERD symptoms, weekly GERD symptoms, or no GERD symptoms as far as demographic features, age of GERD onset, receipt of fundoplication, or current GERD treatment. At endoscopy, three patients had mild to moderate erosive esophagitis.

Conclusions

GERD in otherwise normal children can persist through adolescence and adulthood in a significant proportion of patients who continue to have GERD symptoms and signs, and use antisecretory medications. Childhood GERD is a risk factor for GERD in adolescence and adulthood.

### Inflammatory causes of dysphagia in children [^1134tiTR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are the most common inflammatory causes of pediatric dysphagia, but several other less prevalent conditions should be considered. These conditions can affect one or several aspects of the swallowing process. In some inflammatory conditions dysphagia may be an early symptom. Esophagoscopy and instrumental swallow studies are often needed to determine the underlying diagnosis and best treatment plan. In some inflammatory conditions dysphagia can portend a worse outcome and need for more aggressive treatment of the underlying condition. Consultations with speech language pathology, gastroenterology, dietetics, allergy/immunology and/or rheumatology are often needed to optimize management.

### Clinicopathologic features of esophagitis in children [^116Tcb9N]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The esophagus traditionally has been considered a simple conduit for more than 50 tons of foodstuffs ingested during a lifetime. A growing body of literature, however, is defining the dynamic role of esophageal protective mechanisms and is identifying the immunologic milieu present within the squamous mucosa. When the innate protective mechanisms are overcome by an injurious agent, an inflammatory process ensues, and the clinicopathologic features of esophagitis are manifest. This article focuses on features of several causes of esophagitis in children, including peptic disease, duodenogastroesophageal reflux, Crohn's disease, and infection. In addition, a relatively new, but increasingly recognized, entity-eosinophilic esophagitis-is highlighted.

Of note, in the context of EoE, the terms 'inadequately controlled', 'intolerant to', and 'not candidates for' conventional therapy require clear operational definitions to guide clinical decision-making.

'Inadequately controlled' refers to patients whose symptoms and disease activity persist or worsen despite an appropriate course of conventional therapy (i.e. PPIs, TCS, and dietary interventions). It implies that the chosen treatment regimen, pharmacological or dietary, has not effectively managed or alleviated EoE symptoms and eosinophilic inflammation.

Patients categorized as 'intolerant to' conventional therapy experience adverse reactions or side effects significantly impacting their quality of life (QoL) or hindering adherence to prescribed treatment. These reactions might manifest as allergic responses, gastrointestinal discomfort, or other adverse effects compromising continued adherence to the recommended therapy.

Regarding 'not candidates for' conventional therapy, this category includes individuals for whom standard treatment options are deemed unsuitable or present unacceptable risks. It may encompass patients with contraindications to specific medications or those for whom dietary restrictions are impractical or unsustainable (Figure 6).

Epidemiology

The incidence and prevalence of EoE varied among studies, reflecting differences in population features such as geographical location, ethnicity, gender, and age. These variations were corroborated by Arias et al.who noted a higher prevalence and incidence rate in North America (30.7 and 5.4 per 100,000 inhabitants/year, respectively) than in Europe (16.1 and 1.7 per 100,000 inhabitants/year, respectively). The prevalence rate ratio by gender was also highlighted, with a rate of 53.8 per 100,000 inhabitants for males compared to 20.1 per 100,000 for females. Additionally, this study explored prevalence in different age groups, reporting rates of 28.9 per 100,000 for adults and 26.9 per 100,000 for pediatric patients.

More recently, Navarro et al. conducted a systematic review to assess the current incidence and prevalence of EoE due to its escalating occurrence. They reviewed 29 population-based studies, encompassing 2386 documents, to update outdated estimates of EoE incidence and prevalence. The pooled prevalence of EoE was found to be 34.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with higher rates in adults (42.2) than in children (34). Incidence rates were 6.6/100,000 person-years in children and 7.7/100,000 in adults. The analysis revealed no significant differences between North American and European studies or between different data sources. Despite variations in the definitions used for EoE, a consistent rise in both incidence and prevalence rates over time was observed. These findings indicate a substantial increase in EoE rates compared to previous estimates, especially in developed countries, emphasizing the need for updated awareness and diagnostic strategies for this condition.

Other studies have reported a higher prevalence of EoE among Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. – Considering the heterogeneity among results in various epidemiological studies and systematic reviews and the limited data regarding the Italian national context, clinicians were interviewed to gather epidemiological data in their respective countries. Summarizing questionnaire results based on clinicians' feedback and the variability rates in different countries (e.g. 7/100,000 in Serbia and 500/100,000 in Ireland, averaging 38.7/100,000), along with the similarity between Italy and Spain (67/100,000), the panel agreed on a diagnosed prevalence of 41/100,000 inhabitants (standard deviation: ± 23.89).

### Oesophageal eosinophilia and oesophageal diseases in children: are the limits clear? [^1122N7wk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic oesophagitis and oesophageal motility disorders are among the most common diseases accompanying oesophageal eosinophilia. They have similarities and their limits are frequently not well defined. This article reviews the main characteristics relating to their similarities and differences, highlighting existing controversies among these diseases, in addition to current knowledge. In the case of a patient with symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction, it is suggested to carry out an integral analysis of the clinical features and diagnostic test results, including histology, while individualising each case before confirming a definitive diagnosis. Future investigation in paediatric patients is necessary to assess eosinophilic infiltration in the various layers of the oesophageal tissue, along with its clinical and pathophysiological implications.

### Updated international consensus diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis: proceedings of the AGREE conference [^116xKmvs]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Over the last decade, clinical experiences and research studies raised concerns regarding use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as part of the diagnostic strategy for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We aimed to clarify the use of PPIs in the evaluation and treatment of children and adults with suspected EoE to develop updated international consensus criteria for EoE diagnosis.

Methods

A consensus conference was convened to address the issue of PPI use for esophageal eosinophilia using a process consistent with standards described in the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. Pediatric and adult physicians and researchers from gastroenterology, allergy, and pathology subspecialties representing 14 countries used online communications, teleconferences, and a face-to-face meeting to review the literature and clinical experiences.

Results

Substantial evidence documented that PPIs reduce esophageal eosinophilia in children, adolescents, and adults, with several mechanisms potentially explaining the treatment effect. Based on these findings, an updated diagnostic algorithm for EoE was developed, with removal of the PPI trial requirement.

Conclusions

EoE should be diagnosed when there are symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (or approximately 60 eosinophils per mm²) on esophageal biopsy and after a comprehensive assessment of non-EoE disorders that could cause or potentially contribute to esophageal eosinophilia. The evidence suggests that PPIs are better classified as a treatment for esophageal eosinophilia that may be due to EoE than as a diagnostic criterion, and we have developed updated consensus criteria for EoE that reflect this change.

Results

The epidemiological research identified 648 studies, of which 522 were excluded after title/abstract assessment. Subsequent full-text review excluded 12 studies reporting epidemiological data on other conditions, 7 on EoE and other conditions, and 39 reporting nonspecific epidemiological data. Additionally, nine studies were excluded due to the unavailability of full text. Finally, 59 studies were included (Figure 2).

The current management research identified 619 studies, of which 493 were excluded after title/abstract assessment. Subsequent screening excluded 18 studies reporting a condition other than EoE, 21 presenting insufficient information, and 36 reporting a nonrelevant study type. Finally, 51 studies were included (Figure 3).

After reviewing and critically analyzing the current evidence, a survey has been developed and administered to 80 physicians from different specialty. A total of 52 respondents (65%) completed the questionnaire. The respondents comprised 37 gastroenterologists, 7 allergists, 4 internists, and 3 pediatricians; only 1 responding physician did not indicate his clinical specialization.

### Diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1129F2PY]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a new disease. It is caused by a T-helper type 2 cell response to food antigens in contact with the esophageal mucosa. Although no single feature defines EoE, a constellation of compatible demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings establish the diagnosis. Children present with symptoms and endoscopic patterns characteristic of inflammation, whereas adolescents and adults have manifestations of fibrosis and gross esophageal strictures. Clinical and endoscopic scoring systems have helped to standardize diagnosis. There is controversy in EoE research over the optimal endpoint for treatment. Although the most common endpoint is a reduced number of eosinophils in biopsies, changes in symptoms and endoscopic features are becoming important targets of therapy. We should improve our understanding of EoE progression and the need for maintenance therapy, and continue development of diagnostic tools that avoid endoscopy and biopsy analyses to more easily monitor disease activity.

Regarding specific circumstances for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, management, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to consider ensuring a formal transition of care from pediatric to adult services to improve symptom control, concordance with therapy, and reduce emergency presentations in EoE.

Discussion

Pediatric EGD aids the understanding of the pathophysiology of common GI disorders in children and plays an important role in the management of some disorders. Parallel to the utilization of endoscopy in pediatric patients, the volume of EGD being performed has increased. When using this tool, we need to review its use to maximize its efficacy.

In this multicenter study, we found that abdominal pain was the most common indication, followed by recurrent vomiting, weight loss, GER symptoms, GI bleeding, diarrhea, and others. According to studies performed in large children's hospitals or pediatric clinics, abdominal pain is also the most common indication for upper GI endoscopy in UK and US cohorts. A retrospective analysis (carried out over 20 years from 1985 to 2005) of children and adolescents who underwent EGD at a single center revealed that the proportion of patients with abdominal pain increased from 23 to 43%, while that of patients with GI bleeding declined from 34 to 5% over the 20-year interval. Studies in some small countries have found the most frequent indication in their centers was surveillance for esophageal varices and suspected celiac disease.

Currently, guidelines provide the indications for EGD; the guidelines developed and newly modified in 2014 by ASGE provide indications for EGD. The guidelines developed in 2015 by ESPGHAN and ESGE also elaborate indications for EGD. These two guidelines have the following in common: abdominal pain, weight loss, failure to thrive, unexplained anemia, dysphagia or odynophagia, caustic ingestion, recurrent vomiting with unknown cause, GI bleeding, diarrhea/malabsorption (chronic), and intractable or chronic symptoms of GERD. However, unexplained irritability, anorexia, and suspicion of graft versus host disease differentiate them.

In previous retrospective studies, the diagnostic yield of EGD was significantly different, varying from 18.9 to 79%. Several more recent studies have identified certain basic patient characteristics including age that affect diagnostic yield. The diagnostic yield was found to be higher in teenagers and lower in those aged < 7 years, especially in those without alarming symptoms. In this study, we found that the infant group and the teenager group appeared to have a higher yield of abnormal endoscopic and histological findings, similar to the results of previous studies.

### Clinical evaluation of the child with eosinophilic esophagitis [^112p1x4y]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is based on clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil predominant esophageal inflammation. Clinical symptoms in children with EoE vary based on age and may be nonspecific. EoE has a male predominance with the majority having comorbid atopic disorders. At present, treatment options include medications (proton pump inhibition, swallowed topical steroids), dietary therapy or biologic therapy (dupilumab, approved for those ≥ 12 years of age). Outside of EoE in the context of oral immunotherapy, EoE is typically chronic requiring lifelong therapy. Long-term complications including feeding difficulties, malnutrition, and fibrostenotic disease.
