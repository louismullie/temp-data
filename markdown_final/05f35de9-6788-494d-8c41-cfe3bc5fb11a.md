## Question

Are there any new antiviral drugs available for the treatment of hepatitis C?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any new antiviral drugs available for hepatitis C treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "new" means in the context of the current direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era and recent guideline updates. Then, I should verify which regimens are most recently approved and how they fit into current recommendations. Next, I will check whether any truly novel drug classes or mechanisms have entered practice since the last major approvals. After that, I should review the 2023 AASLD-IDSA guidance to see if any brand-new agents were added. Finally, I will synthesize whether "new" here reflects incremental additions versus a new therapeutic class and outline the current standard of care for context [^111gTVzA] [^111UaJs9].

> Let me first confirm the baseline: the hepatitis C treatment landscape has been dominated by pangenotypic, interferon-free DAA regimens since roughly 2017, with cure rates exceeding 95% in most populations, which sets a high bar for anything truly "new" to be meaningful clinically rather than just chronologically recent [^113mDZjs] [^112txSNE].

> Wait, let me verify the most recent approvals before drawing conclusions. The last major additions to the armamentarium were glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (2017) and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (2017), both pangenotypic, once-daily, all-oral regimens that largely closed earlier gaps, especially for genotype 3 and treatment-experienced patients; these are the regimens typically cited as the "newest" in the DAA era, though they are now several years old [^113Qh7g5] [^114VbAbL].

> Hold on, I should verify what the 2023 AASLD-IDSA guidance actually changed, because that will tell me if any brand-new agents were introduced. The 2023 update emphasized simplified treatment pathways, expanded eligibility for minimal monitoring, and updated pediatric and special-population recommendations, but it did not introduce a new DAA class or a newly approved agent; instead, it refined the use of existing pangenotypic regimens and clarified retreatment algorithms, including the role of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir after sofosbuvir-based failure [^111gTVzA] [^116K7KRx] [^115uvZti].

> I need to check whether any novel mechanisms have reached the clinic recently. Host-targeted agents (HTAs) have been explored as complementary strategies with high barriers to resistance, but they remain investigational and have not supplanted DAAs in routine care; thus, there are no new mechanistic classes in clinical practice beyond NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors that underpin current pangenotypic combinations [^116gbQvX] [^114EDqNa].

> Let me consider what "new" most accurately means right now. In current usage, "new" largely refers to the maturation of simplified, pangenotypic DAA therapy and its broad implementation rather than the launch of additional agents; the field's focus has shifted to access, screening, and minimal-monitoring delivery models rather than new drug discovery, which aligns with real-world implementation reviews and WHO-aligned elimination strategies emphasizing pan-genotypic regimens and simplified care [^11614ncR] [^112txSNE].

> But wait, what if someone is thinking about ultra-short regimens or other experimental durations as "new"? I should double-check that. Trials of 6-week DAA therapy have largely shown inferior SVR compared with standard durations, and abbreviated courses are not recommended for acute or chronic infection outside trials, so these are not new approved options despite ongoing research interest [^114iKp5D] [^116PWptU].

> Next, I should review the current standard to anchor what clinicians are actually using. For treatment-naive adults without decompensated cirrhosis, preferred simplified regimens are glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks; for retreatment after sofosbuvir-based failure, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 weeks is recommended, with adjustments for genotype 3 and cirrhosis per guidance, reflecting the most recent refinements rather than new molecules [^116yie3a] [^115uvZti] [^111UaJs9].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. There are no entirely new antiviral drug classes or brand-new DAA agents entering routine practice since glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir; recent "newness" pertains to streamlined implementation, expanded access, and updated guidance rather than novel therapeutic entities, so the current standard remains pangenotypic DAA combinations with very high cure rates and simplified delivery models [^113Qh7g5] [^111gTVzA] [^113mDZjs].

---

There are **no entirely new classes** of hepatitis C antivirals beyond direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) [^notfound]; recent advances are refinements within existing classes. The newest approved regimens are **glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (8 weeks)** [^116yie3a] and **sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (12 weeks)** [^115uvZti], both pangenotypic and high-efficacy (> 95% SVR) [^113Qh7g5]. Abbreviated 6-week regimens are under study but are **not yet recommended** due to lower SVR rates [^114iKp5D]. Current treatment emphasizes **simplified, pangenotypic DAA regimens** [^116oQEzh] with minimal monitoring [^116d3grq], and no major new agents are pending approval.

---

## Recent advancements in hepatitis C antiviral therapy

### Newly approved antiviral regimens

Recent approvals include **glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P)** — an 8-week, once-daily, pangenotypic regimen for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis, with > 95% SVR [^116yie3a] [^113mDZjs] — and **sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX)** — a 12-week, once-daily regimen for DAA-experienced patients, including those with compensated cirrhosis, also achieving > 95% SVR [^115uvZti] [^116K7KRx].

---

### Abbreviated treatment regimens

Studies of 6-week regimens (e.g. ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) have shown inferior SVR compared with standard durations; therefore, **abbreviated 6-week therapy is not currently recommended** [^114iKp5D] [^116PWptU].

---

### Simplified treatment algorithms

Guidelines now endorse **minimal monitoring** for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis, enabling nonspecialist delivery and expanding access [^116oQEzh] [^111gTVzA].

---

## Current standard of care

The standard of care consists of **pangenotypic DAA regimens** — glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir — achieving > 95% SVR with 8–12 weeks of therapy [^113mDZjs] [^116yie3a]. These regimens have favorable tolerability and minimal adverse effects compared with interferon-based therapies [^117NnExN].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Key challenges include **access and cost**, as high prices and healthcare barriers limit uptake, especially in low- and middle-income countries [^117NnExN] [^111keHht]. In addition, **resistance** may emerge in patients with prior DAA exposure or specific genotypes, necessitating careful regimen selection [^114CNxh1] [^115uvZti].

---

## Future directions

Future efforts focus on **improving access** through pricing strategies, generic competition, and healthcare infrastructure [^117NnExN] [^11614ncR]. Research continues into shorter-duration regimens and novel combinations to optimize outcomes and reduce costs [^111rYYF3].

---

## Conclusion

There are **no entirely new antiviral classes** for hepatitis C; recent progress consists of optimized DAA regimens and simplified care pathways. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir represent the latest standards, achieving > 95% SVR across genotypes [^113Qh7g5]. Abbreviated 6-week regimens remain investigational, and current treatment emphasizes pangenotypic DAAs with minimal monitoring [^116oQEzh].

### New hepatitis C therapies: the toolbox, strategies, and challenges [^114mX17Q]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for hepatitis C is undergoing a revolution. Several new drugs against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have reached the market and many others, including direct-acting antivirals and host-targeted agents, are in phase II or III clinical development. All-oral, interferon-free combinations of drugs are expected to cure more than 90% of infections. A vast amount of data from clinical trials are presented regularly at international conferences or released to the press before peer-review, creating confusion in the viral hepatitis field. The goal of this review is to clarify the current stage of HCV therapy and drug development. This review describes the different classes of drugs and their mechanisms and properties, as well as treatment strategies in development, including those that are interferon-based and interferon-free. HCV treatment options that will be available in 2014–2015 are presented for each genotype. A number of unanswered questions and challenges remain, such as how to treat special populations, the role of ribavirin in interferon-free regimens, the role of HCV resistance in treatment failures, and how to best re-treat patients who failed on treatment. Strategic choices, cost issues, HCV screening, and improving access to care in resource-constrained areas also are discussed.

### Hepatitis C virus treatment: is It possible to cure all hepatitis C virus patients? [^111SjTki]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The recent advances in hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapeutics have brought combinations of direct acting antiviral medications that offer interferon-free, well-tolerated regimens with sustained virologic response rates greater than 90% in clinical trials for many patient groups. The successes have prompted discussions regarding cure for all patients. These regimens have already demonstrated the ability to cure previously challenging patient groups, including human immunodeficiency virus-HCV coinfection, decompensated cirrhosis, and post-liver transplantation. Limitations exist in the current portfolio of agents, with suboptimal outcomes for genotype 3 and limited data in genotypes 5 and 6. More data are urgently needed in patients with chronic kidney disease and in children. With ongoing developments, highly effective regimens for all these patient groups are within reach. To deliver HCV treatment throughout the world and particularly in low- and middle-income countries, regimens need to be affordable but also pan-genotypic, well-tolerated, and delivered once daily for 4–8 weeks. With such a regimen, cure for all patients would then hinge on the ability to identify patients with HCV infection and deliver treatment within their communities. This review will discuss the strategies that will be necessary to realize this opportunity to cure all persons with HCV infection.

Development of antiviral agents that target the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has improved the success and tolerability of treatment, especially for patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The new treatment options mean that clinicians are better able to prevent complications from chronic HCV infection. The field of direct-acting antiviral therapies for HCV infection continues to advance at a rapid pace, and many more potential treatment regimens are being investigated. This article presents a summary of the current treatments available for patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and looks ahead to those that may play a role in the future.

### New therapeutic options for hepatitis C [^112BVMcq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is an urgent need for new anti-hepatitis C virus therapies and recently a number of agents have reached clinical trials with yet more in preclinical stages of development. New technologies for the in-vitro study of drugs have accelerated progress markedly, previously hampered by the lack of cell-culture systems or animal models for hepatitis C.

Recent Findings

A number of agents have demonstrated potent antiviral activity and synergism with existing therapies. A better understanding of managing adverse events and tailoring treatment dose and duration have yielded improved treatment response rates. We review the mechanisms of both new and existing anti-hepatitis C virus drugs and the data for some promising new agents and strategies.

Summary

Although many of the agents reviewed are in the early stages of development they show great promise and the ever-increasing understanding of hepatitis C virus will undoubtedly lead to exploration of new targets. Much progress has been made in terms of maximizing success with currently licensed agents and lessons learned from the field of HIV can guide the careful use of new agents to minimize resistance in the future.

### Novel therapies for hepatitis C-one pill fits all? [^1173uSnD]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2013). Medium credibility.

Almost 25 years after the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was identified, and following intense research and development efforts, a large number of direct-acting antiviral drugs are now beginning to reach patient care. Accordingly, the way in which care is delivered is evolving at a breath-taking pace. Here, we review the current and upcoming treatment options for HCV, describe the key challenges facing clinicians and drug developers and discuss how the landscape in the HCV arena will change over the coming years.

### Treatment decisions and contemporary versus pending treatments for hepatitis C [^111J2cQh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

The primary aim of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the prevention of progressive disease. A response to interferon (IFN) treatment is associated with an improvement in all-cause mortality and liver-related mortality from hepatitis C. Unless contraindicated, patients with CHC are thus potential candidates for treatment. Improved response rates are observed in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection treated with first-generation protease inhibitors. However, treatment with current first-generation protease inhibitors and IFN is complex and can result in appreciable adverse effects. The advent of potent, pan-genotypic all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens necessitates a critical examination of the immediate application of PEG-IFN, ribavirin and DAA regimens in patients with CHC. Current guidelines and position statements do not make clear recommendations, and are behind the emerging data. Some aspects of the conundrums facing physicians and patients are summarized in this Review. Cirrhosis presents an immediate threat of disease, and ideally treatment should be targeted at those patients who have advancing or advanced disease; unfortunately, a disparity exists, as response rates are reduced in patients with cirrhosis and the risks of adverse events are increased. On balance, patients with mild disease could consider deferring treatment.

### Future therapies for chronic hepatitis C [^112gd2BN]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Therapy for hepatitis C has been fairly stagnant for the past decade, but the past few years have seen major progress and evolution, beginning with the approval of two HCV protease inhibitors in 2011. In spite of considerable improvements in response rates with these agents, a need for additional agents with improved potency and tolerability remains. Toward this goal and over the course of just a few months, the HCV therapy pipeline has already become crowded with direct-acting antivirals, host-targeted agents and unique interferons, all of which are positioned to be part of the next wave of therapeutic options. The ultimate goal of this push for new agents is to achieve a safe and straight forward yet highly effective therapy for hepatitis C that is widely embraced and readily available. Particularly among the 'baby boomer' population, it is predicted that over the next few years, more patients with currently quiescent infections will be newly diagnosed, and those currently diagnosed will be at increased risk of long-term complications of infection, and thus in need of treatment. A simple and safe treatment paradigm will become a necessity. This Review chronicles the latest developments in hepatitis C therapy and the potential effect these new treatments could have on delivery of care to patients infected with HCV.

### The hepatitis C revolution part 1: antiviral treatment options [^115ezNT8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The rapid evolution in the therapeutic landscape of hepatitis C presents a minefield to clinicians seeking to optimize therapy for their patients. Efficacy, evidence-base, side-effects, and drug combinations must be tailored to individual patients, taking into account comorbidities, degree of fibrosis, evidence of hepatic decompensation, and life expectancy. The review article aims to discuss novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments with an overview of recent breakthrough research validating their potential. It is hoped that this systematic evaluation will clarify best available evidence for clinicians treating patients with HCV on a regular basis.

Recent Findings

With greater understanding of the HCV life cycle and viral genome, the last decade has seen the emergence of novel direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, which specifically target proteins responsible for viral replication. Landmark clinical trials have offered robust evidence supporting the use of DAA agents as pioneer treatments, alone, or in combination with standard pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV)-based regimens. DAAs have proved highly efficacious, with pan-genotypic activity, shortened treatment duration, and an improved side-effect profile when compared with historical peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Recent phase 3 studies have provided proof-of-concept that all-oral, IFN-free DAA regimens can yield high rates of sustained virological response across most HCV genotypes.

Summary

The ability of DAAs to dramatically improve virological clearance heralds a new era in clinical therapeutics, as the unprecedented prospect of cure for a chronic viral infection becomes tangible. However, myriad clinical challenges remain before global eradication of HCV can become reality.

### What are the benefits of a sustained virologic response to direct-acting antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection? [^111keHht]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are safe and effective at eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unfortunately, DAAs remain expensive, so treatment of all HCV-infected patients would substantially affect health care costs. It is therefore important to continue to assess the hepatic and extrahepatic benefits of a DAA-induced sustained virologic response (SVR). A DAA-induced SVR reduces a patient's risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection; there are also data to indicate that an SVR can reduce mortality. SVR is a relevant clinical end point, but further analyses are required to confirm its importance among diverse HCV-infected populations and to document the public health benefits of HCV elimination at the population level. We review the evidence for the benefits associated with SVRs in different clinical settings and challenges to data collection.

### Hepatitis C virus therapy update 2013 [^1143pyxz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review here the recent literature regarding hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy through January 2013. We discuss current therapies, targets for new therapies, and what might be expected in this rapidly changing field.

Recent Findings

Boceprevir-based and telaprevir-based triple therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin marked the beginning of a new era in HCV therapy for genotype 1 patients. New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are being developed and new antiviral drug targets are being explored. New combination treatment regimens are expected to emerge soon and there is hope for interferon-free regimens.

Summary

The standard of care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 changed dramatically with the approval of two new DAA drugs — telaprevir and boceprevir — for use in pegylated interferon-based and ribavirin-based triple therapy in mid-2011. Experience has shown improved response rates and treatment durations for many patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. However, persistent limitations to HCV treatment still exist for patients with prior treatment failure and comorbid conditions and patients on newer therapies suffer additional therapy-limiting side effects and drug-drug interactions. Genetic testing may provide some guidance but additional options for therapy are still needed for HCV. Many new drugs are currently under investigation and there is hope that effective and well tolerated interferon-free regimens may become a part of future therapy.

### From current status to optimization of HCV treatment: recommendations from an expert panel [^1161PRis]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem at a global level, causing an enormous burden of hepatic and extra-hepatic morbidity and mortality. Treatment of chronic HCV (CHC) has been revolutionized in the last few years by the introduction of highly effective and well tolerated direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) able to achieve > 90% rates of sustained virological response (SVR) in many groups of patients, including those previously excluded from interferon-based regimens. For such reason interferon-free regimens are now the treatments of choice for all patients. Successful anti-HCV treatment can stop liver disease progression and can solve the HCV-related extra hepatic manifestations, eventually reducing both liver-related and overall mortality. Together with the rapidly accumulating data about the evolution of treatment landscape, different guidelines from national and international Liver Scientific Societies have been published until today. However, these recommendations may not be applied worldwide as, due to high treatment costs, most of them identify as priority groups only patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover some types of patients pose clinical management problems for which even the guidelines do not always provide useful answers. With the aim of treatment optimization by filling some of the gaps of the current guidelines and addressing the remaining unmet needs in practice, a group of Italian experts, experienced on treatment of HCV infection, met in Stresa in February 2016. The summary of all the considerations arising from this two-day meeting and the final statements are reported in this position paper.

### Treating viral hepatitis C: efficacy, side effects, and complications [^113XtCnY]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of hepatitis C has dramatically improved over the past decade. Unlike any other chronic viral infection, a significant proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C can be cured. However, the current standard therapy — pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin — has its limitations. Limited efficacy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and the side effect profile will necessitate the development of new therapeutic approaches. This review describes the efficacy and optimisation of the current standard therapy of hepatitis C and its problems in special patient populations. New treatment directions beyond interferon alpha based therapies are on the horizon.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111YoVx3]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral therapy — The HCV guidance panel strongly recommends antiviral treatment for all adults with acute or chronic HCV infection (except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated); this recommendation includes persons with ongoing substance use (alcohol or drugs), and several studies demonstrate that treatment-committed individuals achieve sustained virologic response rates with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy comparable to those without known, current substance use, noting that DAA therapy is safe and cures HCV infection in most people.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114j1D6y]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — definition, epidemiology, and interim management are outlined as follows: Acute HCV infection is arbitrarily defined as the first 6 months of infection, with jaundice in a minority of patients (< 25%). In the United States, the CDC estimates that 44,300 acute HCV infections occurred in 2017 with the upper limit of the confidence interval being 151,000 cases, and an estimated 75% of persons acutely infected with HCV progress to chronic infection. Treatment as prevention has been observed in cohorts of HIV-positive men who have sex with men when unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in acute HCV infections. In the interim, current guidance is to treat with regimens and durations as recommended for chronic HCV infection until additional data on abbreviated treatment regimens become available.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^116pKZWP]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

The current preferred treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is combination therapy consisting of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (RBV) for 24–48 weeks. Although this approach appears to be highly effective for patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, who have a sustained virological response (SVR) of approximately 80%, the treatment algorithm is less effective for patients with HCV genotype 1, as these patients have SVR rates of just 40–50%. In order to improve treatment outcomes, this article explores potential approaches for the optimization of treatment for patients with HCV genotype 1: considering shorter treatment periods for patients with a rapid virological response (RVR), increasing treatment periods for slow responders, and increasing RBV dose are all suggestions. Results from clinical trials suggest that approximately 20% of the HCV genotype 1-infected population are slow responders, and around 15% of all HCV genotype-1 infected patients could benefit from a shorter treatment duration without compromising the SVR rate. Interest has also focused on whether treatment duration could be individualized in some patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection. Here all the findings from recent studies are translated into practical advice, to help practitioners make evidence-based treatment decisions in everyday clinical practice. Although there are areas where currently available data do not provide conclusive evidence to suggest amending treatment approaches, there is clearly potential for individualized treatment in all aspects of hepatitis treatment in the future.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113mDZjs]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) effectiveness and access — Overall, DAA regimens successfully cure HCV infection in > 95% of treated persons, yet despite therapeutic improvements, in 2015, only 7.4% of persons with diagnosed HCV had begun antiviral treatment, and more recent limited data indicate increased DAA access and uptake that has been uneven geographically and across different patient populations.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116PWptU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — abbreviated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens: There are presently insufficient data to recommend abbreviated courses of any approved DAA regimens; until more definitive data are available, recommended treatment is as described for chronic hepatitis C infection in the online HCV guidance. Pangenotypic regimens, as recommended in the simplified HCV treatment section, represent the preferred choice for eligible patients, and for patients who are ineligible for simplified HCV treatment, genotyping may be considered to guide DAA regimen selection.

### HCV drug discovery aimed at viral eradication [^111Mger5]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide with nearly 3% of the world population infected by this virus. Fortunately, this virus does not establish latency, and hence it may be possible to eradicate it. HCV is strongly associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is currently treated with pegylated interferon-alpha (peg-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin. Unfortunately, these limited treatment options often produce significant side effects, and currently, complete eradication of virus with combined drug modalities has not yet been achieved for the majority of chronically HCV-infected individuals. Restricted treatment options, lack of a universal cure for HCV and the link between chronic infection, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma necessitate design of novel drugs and treatment options. Understanding the relationship between the immune response, viral clearance and inhibition of viral replication with pharmacology-based design can ultimately allow for complete eradication of HCV. This review focuses upon significant novel preclinical and clinical specifically targeted antiviral therapy (STAT-C) drugs under development, highlights their mechanism of action, and discusses their impact on systemic viral loads and permanent clearance of infection.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2018 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114VbAbL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Recognizing the importance of timely guidance regarding the rapidly evolving field of hepatitis C management, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed a web-based process for the expeditious formulation and dissemination of evidence-based recommendations. Launched in 2014, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance website undergoes periodic updates as necessitated by availability of new therapeutic agents and/or research data. A major update was released electronically in September 2017, prompted primarily by approval of new direct-acting antiviral agents and expansion of the guidance's scope. This update summarizes the latest release of the HCV guidance and focuses on new or amended recommendations since the previous September 2015 print publication. The recommendations herein were developed by volunteer hepatology and infectious disease experts representing AASLD and IDSA and have been peer reviewed and approved by each society's governing board.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111gTVzA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have collaboratively developed evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since 2013. A panel of clinicians and investigators with extensive infectious diseases or hepatology expertise specific to HCV infection periodically review evidence from the field and update existing recommendations or introduce new recommendations as evidence warrants. This update focuses on changes to the guidance since the previous 2020 published update, including ongoing emphasis on recommended universal screening; management recommendations for incomplete treatment adherence; expanded eligibility for simplified chronic HCV infection treatment in adults with minimal monitoring; updated treatment and retreatment recommendations for children as young as 3 years old; management and treatment recommendations in the transplantation setting; and screening, treatment, and management recommendations for unique and key populations.

### Challenges and perspectives of direct antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection [^113Qh7g5]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has been revolutionised by the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). All-oral, once-daily, 8- to 12-week treatment regimens are now standard of care, with viral eradication possible in > 95% of patients across different populations. Despite these advances, several unresolved issues remain, including treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3, chronic kidney disease, and those in whom DAA therapy has previously failed. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir are the most recently approved DAA regimens. Given the overwhelming success of modern DAA-based therapies, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir are also likely to represent the last DAAs to be approved. Both are pangenotypic, once-daily, all-oral DAA combinations that have the potential to close the gaps in the current DAA treatment portfolio. Herein, we review the challenges associated with current DAAs and how these two regimens may be implemented in existing treatment algorithms.

### Novel emerging treatments for hepatitis C infection: a fast-moving pipeline [^114uhzHQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C has been one of the pinnacles of medical science in the last 25 years. The age of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has led to cure rates > 95% with shorter duration and low toxicity regimens, thus changing the landscape of the era of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (RBV). However, there remain some challenges with these therapies as there are multiple regimens available with a fair amount of sophistication required to administer them. Treatment continues to require knowledge of prior treatment status, viral genotype and fibrosis assessment, thus affording an opportunity for improvement in future regimens. This update reviews some upcoming therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111Yak2e]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, recent research suggests a number of potential approaches for optimizing therapy for patients with CHC and, as a consequence, increasing SVR rates. Here we have attempted to analyse these findings and translate them into practical advice, to help practitioners make evidence-based treatment decisions in everyday clinical practice. We have also highlighted areas where currently available data do not provide conclusive evidence to suggest amending treatment approaches at present. There is potential for further individualization of therapy when such data become available.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111UaJs9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Initial treatment updates — genotypic activity has been added to the hierarchical ranking of treatment regimens, and there is a recommendation that sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir may be used as an alternative regimen for persons with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis; in the current direct-acting antiviral era of hepatitis C treatment, therapy is described as safe, effective, of relatively short duration, and curative in most people.

### Future classes of hepatitis C virus therapeutic agents [^111VkUHA]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Recent advances in understanding of the molecular characteristics of the hepatitis C virus have led to the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Direct-acting antivirals are designed to inhibit viral targets, whereas host-targeted antivirals block host factors that are used by the virus for its own life cycle. The rapid development of agents in multiple classes has led to the promise of shorter therapy duration, an improved side effect profile, and eventually interferon-sparing regimens. This article reviews novel hepatitis C virus therapeutics in development, including mechanism of action, efficacy, and adverse effects.

### An update on treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116eVLJx]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The standard of care (SOC) therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been the use of both peginterferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV). These drugs are administered for either 48 weeks (HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6) or for 24 weeks (HCV genotypes 2 and 3), inducing sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 40%-50% in those with genotype 1 and of 80% or more in those with genotypes 2 and 3 infections. Once achieved, an SVR is associated with long-term clearance of HCV infection, which is regarded as a virologic "cure", as well as with improved morbidity and mortality. Two major advances have occurred since the last update of treatment guidelines for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) that have changed the optimal treatment regimen of genotype 1 chronic HCV infection: the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agentsand the identification of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV infection. Although PegIFN and RBV remain vital components of therapy, the emergence of DAAs has led to a substantial improvement in SVR rates and the option of abbreviated therapy in many patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. A revision of the prior treatment guidelines is therefore necessary, but is based on data that are presently limited. Accordingly, there may be need to reconsider some of the recommendations as additional data become available. These guidelines review what treatment for genotype 1 chronic HCV infection is now regarded as optimal, but they do not address the issue of prioritization of patient selection for treatment or of treatment of special patient populations.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute clinical practice update-expert review: care of patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection [^116V1Ts6]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is well-recognized as a common blood-borne infection with global public health impact affecting 3 to 5 million persons in the United States and more than 170 million persons worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies with all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents are associated with high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), generally exceeding 90%. SVR is associated with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, and both liver-related and all-cause mortality. However, a subset of patients who achieve SVR will remain at long-term risk for progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality. Limited evidence is available to guide clinicians on which post-SVR patients should be monitored vs discharged, how to monitor and with which tests, how frequently should monitoring occur, and for how long. In this clinical practice update, available evidence and expert opinion are used to generate best practice recommendations on the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus who have achieved SVR.

### Update on hepatitis C virus management [^11614ncR]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a significant contributor to liver-related morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the approach to HCV treatment, the simplified treatment algorithm for most patients, the management of special populations, and future directions for HCV interventions.

Recent Findings

Pan genotypic DAA regimens have high cure rates and can be managed by nonspecialist providers, and the simplified treatment approach provides a clear algorithm for workup and treatment decisions among treatment-naive patients without decompensated cirrhosis. Additionally, advancements in point of care diagnostics have the potential to further expand access to screening and linkage to care. Despite these breakthroughs, barriers to accessing care and the stigmatization of high-risk populations continue to undercut progress towards HCV elimination. Continued implementation of innovative screening and treatment strategies are required to overcome rising HCV prevalence.

Summary

HCV cure is achievable for nearly all patients, but reaching HCV elimination goals will require a comprehensive approach that increases screening, expands access to simplified treatment, and avoids stigmatization of at-risk populations. Targeting healthcare disparities and removing barriers to treatment uptake are crucial to achieving elimination targets.

### The impact of the revolution in hepatitis C treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma [^1119iCu5]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C infection represents a global health problem affecting ∼200 million chronically infected patients worldwide. Owing to the development of a fibrogenic and inflammatory micromilieu in the liver, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are at a high risk of developing fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), however, has spurred a revolution in the treatment of HCV patients with sustained viral response (SVR) rates exceeding 90% in real-life settings. Recent clinical trials suggest that these novel treatments will not only alter the epidemiology of HCV infection but also the incidence of HCV-induced complications including hepatic decompensation, liver transplantation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we summarize data from clinical trials carried out in HCV patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis and analyze the impact of viral clearance on HCC development and treatment. Finally, we review and discuss current and future treatment options of HCV patients with HCC in pre- and post-transplantation settings.

### Hepatitis C therapeutics: current status and emerging strategies [^117ADiVc]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an emerging global epidemic. The development of effective HCV antiviral therapeutics continues to be a daunting challenge owing to the absence of adequate animal models and tissue-culture systems for analysis and propagation of the virus. Despite these obstacles, inhibitors of the replicative elements of HCV, immune modulators and non-specific hepatoprotective agents are being pursued and exciting progress has been made. Successful therapeutic intervention of HCV will probably require combination approaches and new approaches, including host drug discovery targets.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with approximately 71 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Clinical care for patients with HCV-related liver disease has advanced considerably thanks to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as developments in diagnostic procedures and improvements in therapy and prevention. These therapies make it possible to eliminate hepatitis C as a major public health threat, as per the World Health Organization target, although the timeline and feasibility vary from region to region. These European Association for the Study of the Liver recommendations on treatment of hepatitis C describe the optimal management of patients with recently acquired and chronic HCV infections in 2020 and onwards.

### Treatment of hepatitis C: a systematic review [^112tUdoV]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 185 million individuals worldwide. Twenty percent of patients chronically infected with HCV progress to cirrhosis. New, simpler therapeutics using direct-acting antivirals that target various stages of the HCV life cycle are in development to eradicate HCV without concomitant interferon.

Objectives

To summarize published evidence on safety, efficacy (measured by a sustained virologic response [SVR], which is the treatment goal of undetectable plasma HCV RNA 12 or 24 weeks after therapy completion), and tolerability of current US Food and Drug Administration-approved interferon-based regimens and oral interferon-free regimens used for treating HCV infection and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV; to provide treatment recommendations for specialists and generalists based on published evidence.

Evidence Review

A literature search of Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Agricola, Cochrane Library, Cinahl Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Conference Papers Index, Gideon, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Oaister was conducted from January 1, 2009, to May 30, 2014. Publications describing phase 2, 3, and 4 studies evaluating the treatment of HCV were included. Forty-one studies involving 19,063 adult patients were included. Strength of clinical data and subsequent HCV treatment recommendations were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Findings

Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 represent 60% to 75% of HCV infections in the United States. Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 is more difficult to cure than genotype 2 or genotype 3. Patients with HCV genotype 1 should receive treatment with sofosbuvir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin because of the shorter duration of therapy and high rates of SVR (89%-90%). Simeprevir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin is an alternative for patients with HCV genotype 1 (SVR, 79%-86%). Patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, representing 20% to 29% of US HCV infections, should receive therapy with sofosbuvir+ribavirin alone (SVR for genotype 2, 12 weeks' duration: 82%-93%; SVR for genotype 3, 24 weeks' duration, 80%-95%). Patients with HIV-HCV coinfection and patients with compensated cirrhosis (ie, cirrhosis but preserved synthetic liver function) should receive the same treatment as HCV-monoinfected patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

New, short-duration, simpler therapies result in high SVR rates for HCV-infected patients. In conjunction with increased screening for HCV as suggested by recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, availability of new therapies may lead to the treatment of many more people with chronic HCV infection.

### New pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C [^117QmeAm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C infection remains a major global public health burden associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recent advances in antiviral therapy with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the oral protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir introduce a new era of treatment for hepatitis C based on directly acting antiviral agents, which are associated with significant improvements in viral eradication rates in combination with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Newer classes targeting the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease, polymerase, NS5A, and other components of the viral genome demonstrate great promise to further enhance viral eradication with superior efficacy, improved tolerability, shorter duration of therapy, and diminished requirement for interferon. Current and future strategies for HCV pharmacotherapy are reviewed.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111DiSfa]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current treatment algorithms result in rates of sustained virological response (SVR) of ∼80% in patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, suggesting that some of the primary challenges in the management of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) have now been resolved. However, in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the standard combination treatment of 48 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa (peginterferon) and ribavirin (RBV) results in SVR rates of only 40–50%, with higher rates following 48 weeks rather than with 24 weeks of treatment (51% vs 41%, respectively). Emerging data suggest that treatment duration may be shortened or lengthened depending on baseline viral load and virological response at week 4 and/or week 12. This paper considers these results and their implications for treatment optimization and suggests how this latest research can be translated into everyday clinical practice.

### Therapeutic potential of RNA interference: a new molecular approach to antiviral treatment for hepatitis C [^113Z3WHe]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major cause of chronic liver disease with an estimated 170 million carriers worldwide. Current treatments have significant side effects and have met with only partial success. Therefore, alternative antiviral drugs that efficiently block virus production are needed. During recent decades, RNA interference (RNAi) technology has not only become a powerful tool for functional genomics but also represents a new therapeutic approach for treating human diseases including viral infections. RNAi is a sequence-specific and post-transcriptional gene silencing process mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). As the HCV genome is a single-stranded RNA that functions as both a messenger RNA (mRNA) and replication template, it is an attractive target for the study of RNAi-based viral therapies. In this review, we will give a brief overview about the history and current status of RNAi and focus on its potential application as a therapeutic option for treatment for HCV infection.

### Current therapy and new molecular approaches to antiviral treatment and prevention of hepatitis C [^116ENK3c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Current therapeutic options for hepatitis C are limited, especially for genotype 1. For genotypes 2 and 3, pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, can lead to a sustained virological response in up to 80% of patients. Unfortunately, adverse effects of IFN and ribavirin are a major problem and the list of contraindications for HCV therapy is long, including decompensated cirrhosis of the liver and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. New delivery options for IFN and ribavirin are aimed at optimising efficiency and reducing adverse effects. Recent progress in the molecular virology of HCV has identified new targets for antiviral intervention. Inhibition of HCV gene expression and replication as well as immunotherapeutic concepts aimed at enhancing the cellular immune response against HCV are being explored. Solution of the crystal structures of HCV key enzymes led to the design of specific inhibitors including compounds active against the well characterised NS3 serine protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which are currently in the early phase clinical investigation. New strategies for inhibiting HCV gene expression include the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and ribozymes. Immunomodulation by agents such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors, thymosin-alpha 1, histamine or amantadine are being studied in combination with IFN and/or ribavirin. Immunotherapeutic vaccination with recombinant HCV E1 protein improved host immunity against HCV and thus seems to be a promising new option.

Hepatitis C guidance — For HCV-negative recipients of allografts from HCV-viremic donors, prophylactic/preemptive direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with a pangenotypic regimen is recommended, and treatment within the first week after transplantation even if HCV RNA results are not available is a reasonable alternative with a genotype-specific regimen permissible when genotype information is available. Recommended DAA options are: an 8-week course of glecaprevir (300 mg)/ pibrentasvir (120 mg) (I, B), a 12-week course of sofosbuvir (400 mg)/ velpatasvir (100 mg) (I, C), and a 12-week course of ledipasvir (90 mg)/ sofosbuvir (400 mg) for genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 only (I, C).

Simplified HCV treatment for treatment-naive adults — The Guidance Panel continues to strongly recommend universal DAA treatment for all people with acute or chronic HCV infection (except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated by HCV therapy, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy). A key aspect of facilitating the implementation of this recommendation/goal is expanding the pool of clinicians who provide HCV treatment, thereby boosting accessibility and delivery of care. Accordingly and coincident with the accumulation of real-world data and experience with the pangenotypic DAA regimens, the HCV guidance first introduced the simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive persons (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis) in 2019.

### Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients with cirrhosis [^115nwrdm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews treatment options of the approved and soon-to-be approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA)-based therapies in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis.

Recent Findings

DAA-based therapies have been shown to be well tolerated and effective in achieving viral cure in individuals with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Preliminary studies suggest that viral eradication arrests fibrosis progression and could lead to fibrosis regression. Long-term benefits of successful HCV treatment in this population translate into less frequent hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma development, improvements in liver disease severity, reduction of liver-related mortality, and potential obviation of the need for transplantation. The optimization of viral eradication rates requires longer duration therapy and/or more complex combinations of drugs, including ribavirin. Treatment decisions are guided by HCV genotype, renal function, drug-drug interactions, and the severity of cirrhosis. Safety concerns are paramount in individuals with advanced liver disease and continued vigilance for hepatotoxicity and other complications is warranted, especially in those with decompensated cirrhosis.

Summary

The availability of high potency DAA-based therapies with excellent safety profiles has transformed the HCV-infected cirrhotic population into a group that is no longer 'difficult-to-treat'. Understanding the pretreatment factors that predict clinical benefits vs. harm remains key in treating this population.

### Shortening the duration of therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection [^111rYYF3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Combination direct-acting antiviral therapy of 8–24 weeks is highly effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. However, shortening the treatment duration to less than 8 weeks could potentially reduce overall treatment costs and improve adherence. Here we explore the arguments for and against the development of short-duration regimens and existing data on treatment for 6 weeks or less among patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection. Additionally, we identify potential predictors of response to short-course combination therapies with direct-acting antiviral drugs that might be explored in future clinical trials.

### Hepatitis C: recent advances and practical management [^1176VWnr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) remain leading causes of disability and premature death worldwide. In May 2016, the UK, as a member of the World Health Assembly, adopted the Global Health Sector Strategy and its targets to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. In pursuit of this goal, there have been a number of recent advances in viral hepatitis care. Perhaps most notable is the availability of short courses of all-oral curative direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C. However, while access to treatment has been scaled up across the UK, an estimated 93000 people were still living with HCV at the end of 2021 of which three-quarters remained unaware of their infection. This review article will summarise key advances in hepatitis C treatment and prevention and provide a practical approach to the management of individuals living with hepatitis C infection.

### Prioritization for interferon-free regimens and potential drug interactions of current direct-acting anti-hepatitis C agents in routine clinical practice [^116gbQvX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in the market has heralded a new era in the field of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, offering excellent rates of sustained virological response (SVR) that nearly equate to a universal cure. Current DAAs belong to three different classes — NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B polymerase inhibitors, and NS5A inhibitors — and target distinct steps in the HCV replication cycle. Compared to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), given for up to 48 weeks, which were the standard of care for all genotypes of HCV during the last two decades, DAAs have been proven to be not only more efficacious but also markedly safer. Thus, IFN-free DAA-containing regimens represent the scientifically recommended treatment options.

### Short-duration therapy for hepatitis C: suitable for all? [^116XbdmJ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Peginterferon alpha (PegIFN alpha) plus ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (SVR) in more than 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although in the trials which led to the registration of this combination therapy, only a 48-week period of treatment had been evaluated, current international guidelines state that 48 or 24 weeks of treatment should be recommended in accordance with genotype; i.e. 48 weeks for genotypes 1 and 4, and 24 weeks for 2 and 3. However, side effects and the high cost of antiviral therapy forced investigators to evaluate further reductions in the treatment duration. Based on the new evidence that fast and persistent viral clearance is highly predictive of SVR, a week 4 negative HCV RNA by a sensitive molecular assay was recently utilized as a criterion for halving the duration of treatment to 12–16 weeks for genotypes 2 and 3, and 24 weeks for genotype 1 patients. However, some issues on this topic, are still open. In this review, existing evidence is discussed, and both the relevance and limitations of published studies are considered.

### Economics of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C [^1176bL6w]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Although not all patients develop progressive liver disease, chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. To address this need, many new antiviral treatments have become available over the past 10 years. While safety, efficacy, and therapeutic indications have been well established for these agents, the economics of antiviral treatment have become increasingly a focus of discussion for physicians, policymakers, and health payers. In this paper, we will elucidate some economic principles using examples from the treatment of hepatitis B and C. In particular, we will examine the considerations in estimating drug costs, methods for performing economic analyses and lastly summarize published cost-effectiveness analyses for antiviral treatments of chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. This review should help clinicians understand economic issues regarding new drugs and answer questions about whether the clinical benefit provided by a medication justifies its expense.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114UCUfw]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — post-treatment assessment, surveillance, and retreatment: After direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion to assess treatment response, and undetectable HCV RNA represents sustained virologic response (SVR) and virologic cure. For cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended regardless of achieving SVR. For persons with ongoing HCV risk factors, HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure, and if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended.

It is increasingly clear that a tailored therapeutic approach to patients with hepatitis C virus infection is needed. Success rates in difficult to treat and low-responsive hepatitis C virus patients are not completely satisfactory, and there is the need to optimise treatment duration and intensity in patients with the highest likelihood of response. In addition, the management of special patient categories originally excluded from phase III registration trials needs to be critically re-evaluated. This article reports the recommendations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection on an individual basis, drafted by experts of three scientific societies.

### Pangenotypic direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112txSNE]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The benefits of curing HCV infections are far-reaching. In response to emerging treatments, the WHO commissioned a systematic literature review to inform treatment guidelines for the management of persons with HCV infection. Based on the evidence, the WHO recommended the use of pangenotypic regimens to support the global campaign to eradicate HCV infection. With an oral administration, a feasibility advantage of bypassing genotype testing, and favourable tolerability profiles, the widespread adoption of pangenotypic regimens translates to a powerful and effective response to the public health threat posed by HCV infection.

### Optimal dose of peginterferon and ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C [^111w8WLV]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C affects 170 million people worldwide, including up to 4 million people in the United States. The current standard of care therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) while highly successful in patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection, allows for sustained virologic response in 42–46% of treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients, comprising about 70% of cases of chronic hepatitis C in the United States. While awaiting approval of Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy for HCV (STAT-C) agents, which will require the completion of additional clinical trials, it is important to optimize the dose and duration of currently available treatment modalities, namely PEG-IFN and RBV, for treatment of CHC. Results of several recent trials evaluating optimal dosing of RBV and higher than standard dosing of PEG-IFN in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients, as well as data from retreatment trials with "induction" doses of PEG-IFN or high-dose RBV in prior non-responders to IFN-based therapy will be reviewed here. The possibility of shorter duration of therapy for genotype 2 and 3 patients based on recent publications and presentations will be discussed as well.

### Host-targeting therapies for hepatitis C virus infection: current developments and future applications [^114EDqNa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. In the past few years, anti-HCV therapies have undergone a revolution with the approval of multiple direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which enable interferon-free treatments with considerable improvement of sustained virologic response in patients. Today, DAAs have become the standard of care for HCV therapy. However, several limitations remain, which include access to therapy, treatment failure in a subset of patients and persistent risk of HCC development following cure in patients with advanced fibrosis. By targeting conserved host proteins involved in the HCV life cycle, host-targeting agents (HTAs) offer opportunities for pan-genotypic antiviral approaches with a high barrier to drug resistance. Moreover, when applied in combination with DAAs, HTAs could improve the management of difficult-to-treat patients by acting through a complementary mechanism of action. In this review, we summarize the different HTAs evaluated in preclinical and clinical development and discuss their potential role for anti-HCV therapies.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112fLM8J]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Can antiviral therapy for hepatitis C reduce the prevalence of HCV among injecting drug user populations? A modeling analysis of its prevention utility [^111UXk1r]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis C virus antiviral treatment is effective for individual patients but few active injecting drug users are treated. We considered the utility of antiviral treatment for primary prevention of hepatitis C.

Methods

A hepatitis C transmission model among injecting drug users was developed, incorporating treatment (62.5% average sustained viral response) with no retreatment after initial treatment failure, potential re-infection for those cured, equal genotype setting (genotype 1:genotype 2/3), and no immunity. In addition, we examined scenarios with varied treatment response rates, immunity, or retreatment of treatment failures.

Results

In the baseline scenario, annually treating 10 infections per 1000 injecting drug users results in a relative decrease in hepatitis C prevalence over 10 years of 31%, 13%, or 7% for baseline (untreated endemic chronic infection) prevalences of 20%, 40%, or 60%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses show that including the potential for immunity has minimal effect on the predictions; prevalence reductions remain even if SVR is assumed to be 25% lower among active IDU than current evidence suggests; retreatment of treatment failures does not alter the short-term (< 5 years) projections, but does increase treatment gains within 20 years; hepatitis C free life years gained from treating active injecting drug users are projected to be higher than from treating non-injecting drug users for prevalences below 60%.

Conclusions

Despite the possibility of re-infection, modest rates of hepatitis C treatment among active injecting drug users could effectively reduce transmission. Evaluating and extending strategies to treat hepatitis C among active injectors are warranted.

Issues Under Consideration

Principal considerations for treatment of CHC include dose and duration of antiviral therapy (along with related costs), quantification of baseline HCV RNA levels, the definition of response during the early stages and at the end of treatment, as well as the duration of the post-treatment follow-up period. In addition, there remain a number of areas of uncertainty that have also to be taken into consideration, such as the variation in baseline viral load, monitoring time points and the 'time window' within which monitoring needs to take place.

Current treatment algorithm for treatment of patients with HCV

Current treatment recommendations for patients chronically infected with HCV are shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection are more responsive to the current standard of care of peginterferon plus RBV than those with genotype 1 or genotype 4 infection. The rates of SVR for genotype 2 or 3 infection are similar in patients treated for 24 or 48 weeks; thus, for these patients 24-week treatment is generally considered appropriate. For patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the recommended treatment duration is 48 weeks of peginterferon with RBV. While standard doses for peginterferon alfa-2a (180 μg, qw) and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 μg/kg, qw) are well established, different recommendations exist for RBV dose according to HCV genotype and type of peginterferon. It appears that lower doses of RBV are required for treatment of patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 than for genotypes 1 or 4. For the standard duration of treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection, weight-based RBV doses of 800–1200 mg, qd, or up to 1400 mg for patients above 105 kg, are recommended, while no additional benefit of RBV doses higher than 800 mg in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infection was observed in several studies. Available data for patients infected with genotype 5 or 6 are limited; therefore, combination treatment with 1000/1200 mg, qd, RBV for 48 weeks is currently recommended.

### The new paradigm of hepatitis C therapy: integration of oral therapies into best practices [^1119tiEq]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

SUMMARY. Emerging data indicate that all-oral antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) will become a reality in the near future. In replacing interferon-based therapies, all-oral regimens are expected to be more tolerable, more effective, shorter in duration and simpler to administer. Coinciding with new treatment options are novel methodologies for disease screening and staging, which create the possibility of more timely care and treatment. Assessments of histologic damage typically are performed using liver biopsy, yet noninvasive assessments of histologic damage have become the norm in some European countries and are becoming more widespread in the United States. Also in place are new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiatives to simplify testing, improve provider and patient awareness and expand recommendations for HCV screening beyond risk-based strategies. Issued in 2012, the CDC recommendations aim to increase HCV testing among those with the greatest HCV burden in the United States by recommending one-time testing for all persons born during 1945–1965. In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force adopted similar recommendations for risk-based and birth-cohort-based testing. Taken together, the developments in screening, diagnosis and treatment will likely increase demand for therapy and stimulate a shift in delivery of care related to chronic HCV, with increased involvement of primary care and infectious disease specialists. Yet even in this new era of therapy, barriers to curing patients of HCV will exist. Overcoming such barriers will require novel, integrative strategies and investment of resources at local, regional and national levels.

### Host-targeting therapies for hepatitis C virus infection: current developments and future applications [^115XTrhq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic RNA virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Chronic HCV infection is a major public health problem, affecting more than 150 million individuals worldwide. Chronically infected patients are at high risk for developing liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many parts of the world, HCV infection is the major cause of HCC and the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT). There is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection. In the past, interferon (IFN)-based regimens were the standard of care for HCV infection, but only led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) in 50% of patients with serious adverse effects. Recent approval of novel antivirals directly targeting the virus, named direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have enabled IFN-free treatments with considerable SVR improvement (SVR rates over 90%). Although the development of DAAs has revolutionized HCV therapy, several limitations remain: these include limited access to therapy in the majority of infected patients, treatment failure in a subset of patients, potential adverse effects in patients with comorbidity and persistent HCC risk following SVR in patients with advanced fibrosis. Targeting host factors required for virus infection is an attractive complementary strategy to address these challenges. An improved understanding of the viral life cycle based on the development of advanced HCV model systems has enabled the design of new molecules that target key factors of the HCV life cycle, named host-targeting agents (HTAs).HTAs provide a broad antiviral activity with very high genetic barrier to drug resistance due to the extremely low mutational rate occurring within host cells. Several HTAs are now being evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials. Here, we review the different classes of HTAs in preclinical or clinical development and highlight their future role in anti-HCV therapy.

### 25 years of interferon-based treatment of chronic hepatitis C: an epoch coming to an end [^112SiQtC]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis caused by infection with hepatitis C virus C (HCV) (therefore known as chronic hepatitis C (CHC)) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. For the past 25 years, recombinant interferon-α (IFNα) has been the main component of treatments for HCV infection. Treatment efficacy has shown a stepwise improvement following the pegylation of IFNα and its use in combination with other antiviral drugs. However, viral escape mechanisms, refractory IFNα signalling in the liver and substantial drug toxicity still limit the efficacy of this treatment. A new generation of HCV-specific antiviral drugs will probably improve response rates and might replace IFNs in CHC treatment in the next few years. This Timeline article summarizes the history of CHC treatment using recombinant IFNα with an emphasis on the mechanisms of action and the causes of non-response.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute clinical practice update-expert review: care of patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection [^117PQW5R]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) sustained virologic response (SVR) after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — efficacy and residual risks — is characterized by high SVR rates and very low relapse, yet some patients remain at risk for complications. Current therapies with all-oral DAA agents are associated with high rates of SVR, generally exceeding 90%, and 6 currently approved interferon (IFN)-free DAA regimens against genotypes 1−6 have culminated in remarkably high SVR; fewer than 1% of patients relapse after SVR, which during IFN therapy was defined as HCV RNA undetectability 24 weeks and more recently as 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Chronic HCV affects 3 to 5 million persons in the United States and more than 170 million persons worldwide, and while SVR is associated with reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, and both liver-related and all-cause mortality, a subset of patients who achieve SVR will remain at long-term risk for progression in cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with greatest concern being the ongoing risk of HCC in those with pre-existing advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### Hepatitis C treatment update [^11587t6b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C is a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, and the prevalence of hepatitis C-associated complications is increasing. Therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin has become the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C; the sustained response rate for treatment-naïve patients is about 55%. If certain patients fail to achieve a 12-week treatment milestone, an early virologic response, they may be taken off treatment early, potentially sparing them from unnecessary medication. Adherence is critical for treatment success. Although side effects continue to be a hindrance to the success of therapy, agents such as growth factors and antidepressants may help patients to maintain medication dosing and complete treatment. Therapy is generally recommended for those in whom the infection is most likely to progress to cirrhosis; however, there is continued debate about the suitability of certain patients for treatment, including those with persistently normal aminotransferase levels or acute hepatitis C and nonresponders to conventional treatment. Four broad groups of investigational therapeutic agents appear promising for future therapy: modified interferons and ribavirins, immunomodulators, viral life-cycle targets, and antifibrotic agents.

### Management of hepatitis C genotype 4 in the directly acting antivirals era [^1171Necv]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in the treatment of infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has revolutionised the field. Whereas even 5 years ago our clinics were full of patients with no prospect of successful treatment, DAA therapy now means that the majority of patients can be successfully cured with ever decreasing durations of well tolerated regimens. The use of interferon (IFN) will continue to decrease if not cease all together especially in countries with well-resourced healthcare systems. Second-generation and third-generation DAA combinations promise to provide pan-genotypic regimens that will cure > 95% of patients with as little as 6 weeks of treatment. Whether or not even shorter regimens of 4 weeks could be used has recently been brought into question, although it remains a goal that some wish to pursue. The pace of pharmaceutical development in the field is unprecedented, and it is therefore inevitable that reviews such as this one are almost certainly out of date as soon as they are written. Nevertheless, this review will attempt to summarise the current available evidence for the optimal management of genotype 4 (G4) HCV. It is important to state from the outset that this genotype has perhaps not attracted as much attention in large scale clinical trials as that afforded to some of the other HCV genotypes, and this will be highlighted below.

### Host-targeting agents for prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis C-perspectives and challenges [^112iBLNd]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Furthermore, HCV-induced liver disease is a major indication of liver transplantation. In the past years, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting HCV enzymes have been developed. DAAs increase the virologic response to anti-HCV therapy but may lead to selection of drug-resistant variants and treatment failure. To date, strategies to prevent HCV infection are still lacking and antiviral therapy in immunocompromised patients, patients with advanced liver disease and HIV/HCV-co-infection remains limited. Alternative or complementary approaches addressing the limitations of current antiviral therapies are to boost the host's innate immunity or interfere with host factors required for pathogenesis. Host-targeting agents (HTAs) provide an interesting perspective for novel antiviral strategies against viral hepatitis since they have (i) a high genetic barrier to resistance, (ii) a pan-genotypic antiviral activity, and (iii) complementary mechanisms of action to DAAs and might therefore act in a synergistic manner with current standard of care or DAAs in clinical development. This review highlights HTAs against HCV infection that have potential as novel antivirals and are in preclinical or clinical development.

### Hepatitis C: current state of treatment in children [^116dHRj7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C in children is on the rise due to perinatal transmission from infected mothers, and high-risk practices in adolescents and young adults. Prevalence remains underestimated because children at high risk are often not screened. Treatment has evolved over the past decade with the advent of new drugs, and global elimination is now possible. Direct-acting antiviral combinations are safe and effective, with sustained viral suppression rate > 90%, and Food and Drug Administration-approved for children ≥ 3 years old. Although challenging, efficient screening and treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus early is cost-effective and reduces burden of disease and its complications.

1 Introduction

In 2017, the World Health Organization established a target to eliminate chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by the year 2030. Indeed, a recent mathematical model suggests that by focusing public health programs on preventing infection in persons who do not inject drugs, providing harm reduction services to persons who inject drugs, and expanding HCV diagnosis services and treatments to 90% of infected persons, the global elimination goal is achievable by 2032. Nonetheless, challenges persist. Political barriers will need to be overcome while securing funding from national and international public health sources. This is complicated by diminishing investments in global health funding and trends toward universal health coverage and away from disease-specific programming. Yet, several countries, such as Brazil and Australia, have developed innovative approaches to funding HCV programs.

Prior to 2014, HCV treatment centred on the use of interferon-based regimens with generally low cure rates, long durations of therapy, and substantial toxicity. The introduction of highly effective and well-tolerated short course oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy without interferon that can cure HCV infection with high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) within weeks transformed the treatment landscape. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guidelines for the screening, care, and treatment of persons with HCV infection to recommend DAA-based regimens in place of IFN-based regimens. Since the publication of the 2016 guidelines, DAA regimens that do not require ribavirin have continued to improve and several pangenotypic regimens, which successfully resolve HCV infection in over 85% of treated individuals across all six major genotypes, were approved by regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Successful resolution of chronic HCV infection is defined by the WHO, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) as SVR at 12 weeks following the end of treatment (SVR12). This outcome is associated with very low rates of virological relapse. Currently, the pangenotypic DAAs glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (8 week course), sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (12 week course), and sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (12 week course) are approved in most markets for the treatment of HCV-infected persons without cirrhosis.

Following the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured in almost all infected patients. This has led to a number of clinical questions regarding the optimal management of the millions of patients cured of HCV. This position statement provides specific guidance on the appropriate follow-up after a sustained virological response in patients without advanced fibrosis, those with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, and those with decompensated cirrhosis. Guidance on hepatocellular carcinoma risk assessment and the management of extrahepatic manifestations of HCV is also provided. Finally, guidance is provided on the monitoring and treatment of reinfection in at-risk patients. The recommendations are based on the best available evidence and are intended to help healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients after treatment for HCV.

### Pan-genotypic treatment regimens for hepatitis C virus: advantages and disadvantages in high-and low-income regions [^117NnExN]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

During the last 5 years, the availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Compared with interferon/ribavirin-the previous standard of care-DAA combination regimens offer improved sustained virological response (SVR) rates, shorter treatment durations of 8–24 weeks, convenient once-daily single-tablet formulations and more favourable tolerability profiles. HCV treatment is complex, and the choice of therapy must consider a complex range of factors, including baseline viral load, fibrosis stage, the HCV genotype and subgenotype, and the presence of resistance-associated substitutions at baseline. Globally, HCV genotype 1 predominates, and there are extensive data and various treatment options available for this genotype. Genotypes 2–6 are prevalent and may even predominate in different geographical regions, reflecting diverse factors including human migration patterns and unsafe use of injection drugs and blood products. Such factors are themselves influenced by socio-economic factors, and poor regions often have the greatest unmet need for effective HCV therapies. The latest pan-genotypic DAA combination regimens provide the potential to eradicate HCV around the globe, regardless of genotype, hence minimizing the need for virological testing services, which often are unavailable in poorer regions. Economics inevitably remain a barrier to access, and extensive cooperation will be required between clinical organisations and pharmaceutical manufacturers to agree appropriate pricing policies, especially in poorer economic regions. This review considers key data and treatment guidelines for DAA therapies, including pan-genotypic combination regimens, in the context of regional differences in HCV genotype and socio-economic factors.

### Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection after liver transplantation [^116gz9rA]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is a leading cause of end stage liver disease and one of the leading indications for liver transplantation. Furthermore, hepatitis C virus recurrence is universal post-transplant leading to decreased graft and patient survival. Recurrent disease related to hepatitis C virus can lead to between 20 and 30% of patients developing recurrent cirrhosis within 5 years. Treatment options with antiviral therapy are limited and are associated with a significant side-effect profile, suboptimal tolerability and inferior response rates. Attention has therefore turned to strategies that can reduce hepatitis C virus recurrence rates post-transplant. Approximately only 30% of patients will achieve a sustained virologic response with current therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Successful hepatitis C virus eradication is the only factor associated with improved graft and patient survival post liver transplantation. Here we provide an overview of antiviral treatment in patients in the transplant arena and the potential opportunities and challenges with the introduction of new directly acting antivirals in G1 patients.

### Non-epidemic HCV genotypes in low-and middle-income countries and the risk of resistance to current direct-acting antiviral regimens [^114CNxh1]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The revolution in therapeutic options for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important medical advances in a generation and has led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to propose a plan for elimination by 2030. Sustained virological response (SVR) rates of more than 95% have become the norm in high-income countries (HICs), using treatments that have very few side effects and are cheap to manufacture, albeit subject to country-specific pricing differences. However, a key weakness of the clinical research underpinning this plan is that almost all of it was carried out in HICs, a weakness repeatedly acknowledged by the international WHO HCV treatment guidelines committee, that focuses on the needs of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Fig. 1). Early indications that SVR rates might not always be as high as expected in some populations emerged from studies on direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment in Europe and North America that found diverse genotypes in patients originating from sub-Saharan Africa. Subsequently, emerging studies investigating response rates to DAAs in Africa and Asia have confirmed these initial reports on a larger scale.

HCV is one of the most genetically diverse human viruses. This genetic diversity, which varies by geographical region, has not yet been fully characterised, due to under-sampling in many parts of the world, meaning that the likelihood of drug resistance in many viral subtypes has not been assessed. At the time of writing, 8 genotypes and 90 subtypes of HCV have been described with an average pairwise distance of more than 30% between genotypes and an intra-genotype average pairwise distance of 15% between subtypes. These genotypes may be divided into genetically conserved epidemic lineages that have been exported large scale around the world and more localised highly diverse endemic lineages. Several endemic lineages have recently been found to be associated with resistance to some "pan-genotypic" DAA regimens (in particular those containing first-generation NS5A inhibitors) and may represent a threat to the global elimination plans proposed by the WHO.

Hepatitis C Guidance 2023 update — genotype 3 compensated cirrhosis initial-treatment evidence and regimen status: Investigators enrolled 220 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment–naive participants with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis who were randomized to 8 weeks of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg)/voxilaprevir (100 mg) or 12 weeks of once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg), and SVR12 was 96% in both treatment arms. Initial treatment using elbasvir/grazoprevir for genotype 1a infection was changed from a recommended to an alternative regimen because of the need for baseline resistance-associated substitution (RAS) testing, and several regimens are no longer recommended (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir; sofosbuvir and ribavirin; paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir; and sofosbuvir, telaprevir, or boceprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin).

Treatment for chronic viral hepatitis C has advanced dramatically to current standard of care all-oral direct-acting antiviral regimens with relatively short treatment duration and high efficacy. Patients with comorbid end-stage renal disease have constituted a "special patient population" with data and treatment options lagging behind that of the broader population of patients with chronic hepatitis C until recently.

### Management of hepatitis C genotype 4 in the directly acting antivirals era [^1156YkSH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C (G4 HCV) accounts for 13% of worldwide HCV infections; with 10 million people infected with the virus across the world. Up to the end of 2013, the only treatment option for G4 HCV was treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24–48 weeks. Since late 2013, treatment of G4 HCV has been transformed by the licensing of many directly acting antiviral agents (DAA). It is an exciting time to be involved in the management of HCV generally and G4 particularly. Interferon-free DAA regimens are now a reality for G4 HCV. This review will highlight these developments and discuss the data behind the use of these drugs. It will also highlight future regimens that are likely to be available over the coming years.

### Direct-acting antiviral therapy for treatment of acute and recent hepatitis C virus infection: a narrative review [^114hUdCS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Following the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989, 3 decades of basic, translational, and clinical research culminated in the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy-curative oral treatment for HCV infection. The availability of DAA therapy revolutionized HCV clinical management, including acute (duration of infection < 6 mo) and recent (duration of infection < 12 mo) infection. Several DAA regimens, including the contemporary pan-genotypic combinations of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir, have been shown to be safe and effective among people with acute and recent HCV infection, highlighting their potential in an HCV controlled human infection model. This article describes the natural history and management of acute and recent HCV infection in the era of DAA therapy and outlines a strategy for use of DAA therapies in the setting of an HCV controlled human infection model.

### Managing HIV / hepatitis C co-infection in the era of direct acting antivirals [^114vUDwR]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality from co-morbid hepatitis C (HCV) infection in HIV co-infected patients are increasing; hence, the management of hepatitis co-infection in HIV is now one of the most important clinical challenges. Therefore, the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for treatment of HCV has been eagerly awaited to hopefully improve HCV treatment outcome in co-infected individuals. Indeed, the availability of the first HCV protease inhibitors (PI) boceprevir and telaprevir for HCV genotype 1 patients has changed the gold standard of treating hepatitis C allowing for substantially improved HCV cure rates under triple HCV-PI/pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Moreover, numerous other new DAAs are currently being studied in co-infected patient populations, also exploring shorter treatment durations and interferon-free treatment approaches promising much easier and better tolerated treatment regimens in the near future. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain, including choice of patients to treat, potential for drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities between HIV and HCV therapy. The dramatically improved rates of HCV cure under new triple therapy, however, warrant evaluation of these new treatment options for all co-infected patients.

Regarding medical management for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to antiviral therapy, genotype 1a, AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend to administer any of the following daily fixed-dose combination regimens in patients with genotype 1a HCV infection with decompensated cirrhosis ineligible for ribavirin:

- ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg for 24 weeks

- sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg for 24 weeks.

Management of incomplete direct-acting antiviral adherence — scope and referral specifies that incomplete medication adherence is well known, the guidance includes a new algorithm for the management of incomplete adherence as part of DAA treatment monitoring, the algorithm is applicable only to DAA treatment–naive persons and generally the same patient populations who are eligible for the simplified treatment algorithms, and excluded persons with incomplete adherence should be managed in consultation with a specialist in HCV management.

AASLD-IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — pretreatment testing and genotyping: Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiating antiviral therapy to determine baseline viremia (viral load), which may affect treatment duration with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir therapy, and with the advent of pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, HCV genotyping is no longer universally required prior to treatment initiation; pretreatment genotyping is recommended for persons with a prior HCV treatment failure because DAA regimen selection and duration may differ by genotype, and pretreatment genotyping is not required for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis if a pangenotypic regimen is used.

AASLD–IDSA recommended regimens for simplified treatment in compensated cirrhosis list two options with fixed durations: Glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) for a duration of 8 weeks and Sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) for a duration of 12 weeks; notably, pretreatment genotype testing is recommended if sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy is planned because of the necessity for baseline RAS testing in persons with cirrhosis and genotype 3 infection.
