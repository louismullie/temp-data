## Question

10. In Rt triangle ABC, ∠A = 90°, AB = 5 cm, AC = 4 cm, then the length of the angle bisector AD of ∠A is ____ cm.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the length of the angle bisector from the right angle in a right triangle with legs 5 cm and 4 cm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the triangle's geometry and confirm the right angle and leg lengths. Then, I should verify the angle bisector theorem and the formula for the length of an angle bisector in a right triangle. Next, I will calculate the hypotenuse and apply the formula. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider whether an alternative approach yields the same result.

> Let me first confirm the setup: triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with AB = 5 cm and AC = 4 cm, so the legs are 5 and 4 cm and the right angle is at A, which means the angle bisector AD splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles and meets the hypotenuse BC at D [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the angle bisector length formula before I plug in numbers. The standard formula for the length of the angle bisector from vertex A to side BC in any triangle is (tₐ = [2bc cos(A/2)/(b + c)]), where b and c are the adjacent sides and A is the angle being bisected; in a right triangle with A = 90°, cos(45°) = √2/2, so the formula simplifies to (tₐ = [2bc × √2/2/(b + c)] = [bc√2/(b + c)]), which is exactly what I should use here [^notfound].

> I will now examine the calculation: with b = 5 cm and c = 4 cm, the numerator is 5 × 4 × √2 = 20√2, and the denominator is 5 + 4 = 9, so the bisector length is [20√2/9] cm. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222, and √2 is about 1.414, so 2.222 × 1.414 ≈ 3.14 cm, which seems reasonable for a 5–4–√41 triangle [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify with an alternative approach to avoid a mistake. Using coordinate geometry, place A at the origin, B at (5, 0), and C at (0, 4); the angle bisector from A has slope 1 and parametric form (t, t), and it intersects the hypotenuse BC, whose equation is x/5 + y/4 = 1, so substituting y = x gives x/5 + x/4 = 1, which yields 9x/20 = 1, hence x = 20/9 and y = 20/9, so the distance from A to D is √[(20/9)² + (20/9)²] = √[2 × (20/9)²] = 20√2 / 9 cm, confirming the same result [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I might need the hypotenuse length to apply the formula, but I should correct that: the simplified right-triangle bisector formula I used does not require the hypotenuse, so I didn't need to compute BC = √41, though I did confirm it anyway for a sanity check on the triangle's dimensions [^notfound].

> Final answer: The length of the angle bisector AD is [20√2/9] cm, which is approximately 3.14 cm [^notfound].

---

The length of the angle bisector AD in right triangle ABC with ∠A = 90°, AB = 5 cm, and AC = 4 cm is **[20√2/9] cm**. This result is obtained using the angle bisector length formula for a right triangle: (l = [ab√2/(a + b)]), where a and b are the legs. Substituting a = 5 cm and b = 4 cm gives (l = [5 × 4 × √2/(5 + 4)] = [20√2/9]) cm.

---

## Formula for the length of the angle bisector in a right triangle

For a right triangle with legs a and b, the length of the angle bisector from the right angle is given by:

l = [ab√2/(a + b)]

This formula is derived from the general angle bisector theorem and the properties of right triangles [^notfound].

---

## Application to the given triangle

Given:

- AB = 5 cm
- AC = 4 cm
- ∠A = 90°

Substitute a = 5 cm and b = 4 cm into the formula:

l = [5 × 4 × √2/(5 + 4)] = [20√2/9] cm

---

## Verification using coordinate geometry

Place the triangle in a coordinate system with A at the origin, B at (5, 0), and C at (0, 4). The angle bisector of ∠A lies along the line y = x. The equation of the hypotenuse BC is:

[x/5] + [y/4] = 1

Substitute y = x into the equation of BC:

[x/5] + [x/4] = 1 ⇒ [(4x + 5x)/20] = 1 ⇒ [9x/20] = 1 ⇒ x = [20/9]

Thus, the intersection point D is at ([20/9], [20/9]). The length of AD is:

AD = √(([20/9])² + ([20/9])²) = √[2 × ([20/9])²] = [20√2/9] cm

---

## Conclusion

The length of the angle bisector AD is **[20√2/9] cm**.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^cd5cdf0e]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Trapezoid and 30-60-90 right triangle

This set of experiments was carried out in a right triangle (30°, 60°, 90°) and a trapezoid environment. Corner angles from the trapezoid were 55°, 90°, 90° and 125°. The dimensions of the mazes were 46 (L) × 28 (W) × 30 (H) cm. In total, we conducted 16 sessions each (25 min per session) from eight mice for the right triangle and trapezoid. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked across the sessions for each mouse. Other recording protocols were the same as described above.

Insertion of a discrete corner in a square environment

This set of experiments was carried out in a large square environment with dimensions of 40 (L) × 40 (W) × 40 (H) cm. The experiments comprised a baseline session followed by four sessions with the insertion of a discrete corner into the square maze. In these sessions, the walls that formed the discrete corner were gradually separated by 0, 1.5, 3 and 6 cm. Starting from 3 cm, the animals were able to pass through the gap without difficulty. The dimensions of the inserted walls were 15 (W) × 30 (H) cm. For each condition, we recorded eight sessions (30 min per session) from eight mice by conducting a single session from each mouse per day. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked throughout the sessions.

Corner coding is specific to environmental corners

To investigate the degree to which corner cells specifically encode environmental corners, we considered three properties that comprise a corner: (1) the angle of the corner, (2) the height of the walls and (3) the connection between two walls. First, we imaged as animals explored two asymmetric environments: a right triangle (30-60-90° corners) or a trapezoid (55-90-125° corners) (Fig. 2a). In these asymmetric environments, corner cells composed 3.6 ± 0.3% and 2.1 ± 0.3% of all neurons recorded in the right triangle and the trapezoid, respectively (Fig. 2b, c; n = 8 mice). By comparison, there were essentially no neurons classified as corner cells when points on the wall were assigned as the 'corners' of these environments (Extended Data Fig. 1n). In the right triangle, corner cell peak spike rates were significantly higher for the 30° (2.32 ± 0.14, mean ± s.e.m.) corner compared to the 60° (1.67 ± 0.16) and 90° (1.76 ± 0.16) corners, but did not differ between the 60° and 90° corners (Fig. 2b, d). To rule out the possibility that this was due to the limited angular range of these acute angles, we compared the peak spike rates at the corners of the trapezoid and found that the peak spike rates of corner cells increased from 125° (1.49 ± 0.12, mean ± s.e.m.) to 90° (1.90 ± 0.10) to 55° (2.23 ± 0.12) (Fig. 2e). We also compared the peak spike rates at the corners using the aforementioned across-session corner cells in the triangle (60°, 1.76 ± 0.12, mean ± s.e.m. n = 9 mice), square (90°, 1.47 ± 0.11) and hexagon (120°, 1.44 ± 0.13), and found the peak spike rate was higher in the triangle compared to the square and hexagon (Fig. 2f). Together, these results suggest that corner cells encode information regarding corner angles, particularly within asymmetric environments.

### Distribution of angle alpha in a large population in Eastern China: an analysis of the 30705 eyes using the ray tracing aberrometer [^a0fbd68b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Reflecting the current state of knowledge, this study represented the most comprehensive investigation into angle alpha globally to date. By evaluating angle alpha's distribution within a substantial cohort, this research offered critical insights into its variability. Crucially, it established a clear correlation between the magnitude of angle alpha and key demographic factors, including ocular laterality, gender, and age, thereby enriching our understanding of its clinical significance.

In terms of the orientation of angle alpha, the predominant alignment was horizontal, with a particular emphasis on the temporal side, corroborating the findings of several previous research. However, discrepancies emerged in comparing of the magnitude with prior studies, in which the average magnitude of angle alpha was estimated to be around 0.44 and 0.45 mm.

In our study, the overall sample's results showed an average angle alpha magnitude of about 0.30 mm, which is smaller than those observed in other studies. A summary of the angle alpha magnitude in previous studies were shown in Table 4. Our findings indicate that the magnitude of angle alpha is associated with factors such as age, refractive status, and ethnicity. The participants in our study ranged from 10 to 99 years of age, with a large number of myopic young patients. Both the wide age span and the proportion of myopia patients were the major factors leading to the differences with other previous studies. Geometrically, this difference can be intuitively understood, considering that angle alpha represents one side of a right triangle defined by the axial length and the transverse displacement of the fovea of the macula. Consequently, patients with high myopia frequently exhibit a smaller angle alpha.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^209ec7ce]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular access is routinely performed by critical care physicians and the use of ultrasonography is recommended. However, complications during vessel puncture are not rare, particularly for residents in training with low levels of experience. Reminding about the properties of the isosceles right triangle might be of interest to teach young fellows a secure step by step technique for vessel catheterization.

An isosceles right triangle has two equal legs and has angles of 90°, 45° and 45°. For two equal legs having the length ɭ, the hypotenuse has a length corresponding to ɭ × √2. This last number, also called Pythagoras' constant, corresponds approximately to 1.4. After a longitudinal scan of the vein run, let's insert the needle in the skin, just over the vein (Fig. 1a). Let's position the probe perpendicular to the skin, just over the vein, at a length ɭ of the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vein under the probe. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe.

Global overview of ultrasound-guided vessel puncture and use of the isosceles right triangle. a Taking a distance between the probe and the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vessel, a probe perpendicular to the skin, and an angle between the skin and the needle of 45°, the third angle will be automatically positioned into the vein. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe. b The long-axis plane, which passes through the length of the vessel, corresponds to the view obtained in the in-plane technique with the vessel in the long-axis. Three points determine the long-axis plane: the needle insertion point, identified by inserting the needle in the skin just above the vessel, the vessel being viewed in the long axis; the middle of the probe on the skin, the vessel being visualized at the center of the ultrasound screen in the short axis; the middle of the probe's top, the probe being perpendicular to the skin. The operator should attempt to maintain the syringe in the axis of the probe top (dotted line)

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^835f8daf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Through discrete peeling of the film belt, local curvature can be programmed and thus different polygonal shapes such as triangle, quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon were also obtained by simply arranging the adhesive layers with predetermined widths and intervals according to the interior angles and side lengths of the targeted shape and peeling the film under the according parameters (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Movie 7). Taking right triangle with an interior angle of 60° and shortest side of 10 mm and the 80 μm thick PTFE film at a peeling angle of 180° as an example, the diameter of the peeled film, d is ~2 mm and thus the widths of adhesive tapes (w a = (180 - θ)π d /360, θ is the interior angle) are 2.62 mm, 1.57 mm and 2.09 mm for interior angles of 30°, 90°, and 60°, respectively and intervals are 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e, left). When peeling the film at peeling angle of 180°, the default right triangle was obtained (Supplementary Movie 7). Furthermore, complex 3D structures can be designed and fabricated through a multistep peeling process. For example, a two-step peeling process with orthogonal peeling directions and opposite curling directions can form hyperboloids (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Movie 8). In step I, a PTFE film (4 cm × 2 cm) was attached on two separated adhesive tapes (1 cm × 2 cm with an interval of 2 cm) and peeled off along the red line (Fig. 3f, left); in step II, the other side of the PTFE film was adhered on the adhesive tape (2 cm × 2 cm) and peeled off along the blue line with different peeling angles for the hyperboloids and semi-hyperboloids, before which the parts adhered in the first step were cut into parallel strips along their curling direction. More complex final 3D geometries can also be programmed by designing the layout of the 2D precursors and peeling them along the default routes (adhered regions, peeling direction, and peeling angle). Using this method, we obtained seventeen highly complex 3D geometries from ten 2D precursors and remarkably good agreement between experimental results and FEA predictions further verified the versatility of this shape-morphing strategy and the accuracy of the models (Fig. 4). Apart from the polymer films, the peeling-induced shape morphing strategy is also applicable to other materials capable of plastic deformation, such as metals (copper, silver, aluminum, nickel, titanium, and iron), semiconductor polymer films (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT), filter paper, and composite films ranging from centimeter to micrometer (Supplementary Fig. 18).

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^589a48c2]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

ACA tracking

We analyzed A1, A2, and A3 segments of the ACA. In the first step, starting and ending point of the tracking were manually selected. Then, their nearest edge points were identified. Searching for other points was performed stepwise along the vessel axis: in the n th step, semi-ellipse shape-searching region was defined with center O n, major axis length a n, minor and axis length b n, and a direction vector. O n was defined as the midpoint between previously found edge points, was defined as, and ellipse axes were calculated with the given formulas:where d n is the distance between two previously selected points and θ n is the angle betweenand. Finding of more or less than two edge points in the n th step was treated as vessel crossing or branching, and points located in that step were not taken into consideration. Curve-connecting midpoints between each pair of edge points, representing the ACA course, were used for further analysis (Fig. 1).

Relative length

The first of used tortuosity descriptors is RL, calculated with the given formula:where l c is the curve length and l is the length of the straight line between the start and end points of the curve. RL is lower for curves which are more deviated from straightness (Fig. 2 a).

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^c98160a8]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy before surgery (A–C). The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal end of the humerus (line AB). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction. The lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site. D, The distal lateral humeral marking line (solid line). DAE refers to the included angle formed by the intersection of line DA and line AE.

The patient was supine, and the affected side was abducted and placed on the abduction operation platform. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a tourniquet. A 4 to 6 cm longitudinal incision was made over the lateral distal humerus and the interval between the brachioradialis and triceps muscles was developed. The distal humerus was exposed circumferentially by subperiosteal dissection. First, a longitudinal marking line was marked on the lateral edge of the distal humerus with an electric motor saw for alignment of the lateral edge after osteotomy and correction of distal humeral hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). A 2.0 mm Kirschner wire (K -wire) was inserted from the lateral edge of the humerus under fluoroscopy, 0.5 to 1 cm above the olecranon fossa, and perpendicular to the lateral edge of the distal end of the humeral osteotomy (Fig. 1 A) to locate the initial osteotomy line (line AB), and then osteotomy was performed with an electric motor saw along the direction of the K -wire. Using a goniometer and scale, all lines as preoperative planned were drawn on the proximal end of the humeral osteotomy, and osteotomy cuts were made accordingly. The right-angled triangle-shaped bone was removed (Fig. 1 B) and the lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site to correct the varus on the coronal plane (Fig. 1 C). According to the longitudinal marking line of the lateral edge of the distal humerus, the distal end of the humeral osteotomy was tilted forward to correct the elbow hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). The osteotomy site was cross-pinned with 1.5 to 2.0 mm K -wires (Fig. 2). Stability of the construct was confirmed by taking fluoroscopic views under valgus and varus stress. Additional K -wires or screws could be used if required according to stability. After wound closure, a long-arm cast was applied with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the forearm was in a neutral position.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^a4d7097c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### Rapid active zone remodeling consolidates presynaptic potentiation [^13e85582]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To investigate the AZ structure in an approach independent of the cluster-distance minimization procedure described above, we repeated the averaging in a different way as follows. We developed a MATLAB code for AZ centering and alignment by rotation of the highest intensity pixel to identical angles and therefore similar positions, which yielded qualitatively similar results (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Again, high-intensity clusters were detected in AZ images cleaned from clusters belonging to bordering AZs, and all translations and rotations were then performed on unretouched images. The center of mass of the found cluster coordinates was calculated and the image shifted so that the center of mass of the coordinates was in the center of the 51 by 51 pixel space (x = y = 26; see Eqs. (1) to (6)). Only the position of the brightest pixel was then considered for rotation. To determine the angle by which to rotate each image to place this highest intensity pixel to the same fixed position (on the vertical midline between the two top image quadrants — the "twelve o'clock" position), the x and y distances to the center of rotation (equal to the center pixel of the image x = y = 26) were calculated to find the length (l) of the hypotenuse and the opposite side of the right triangle using pdist. The angle α in degrees was then calculated by taking the inverse sine in degrees of this value (MATLAB function asind), as shown in Eq. (9). In cases where the brightest peak was located above the horizontal midline, the adjacent side of the triangle was the vertical midline. In cases where the brightest peak was located below the horizontal midline, the angle was calculated with the horizontal midline being the adjacent side, and 90° were added to the final angle value. Additionally, in cases where the brightest peak was located to the right of the vertical midline, the angle was multiplied with −1. To generate the results shown in Supplementary Fig. 3b, which shows the averaging of AZ images within randomly assigned categories, we generated a number of random category values and then proceeded with the averaging procedure described above. For this, we reproduced the distribution of category values from the AZ dataset according to the histogram values of the category vector as follows. A histogram of the category vector was generated (MATLAB function histogram) with a bin width of 1, yielding the absolute amount of AZs per category. A cumulative sum vector was calculated from these histogram values (MATLAB function cumsum). For each position in the category vector, we then chose a random number between 0 and 1 and multiplied it by the number of images. We then found the first position in the cumulative sum vector that was larger than this random value. The position found was equal to the assigned category. This resulted in a randomly assigned category vector with a similar distribution of categories as the original vector.

### A QTL study for regions contributing to arabidopsis thaliana root skewing on tilted surfaces [^9d82f188]. G3 (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Measurements taken of seedlings (after). Measurements were started at the black felt-tip marker line indicating the position of the root tip on the back of the plate after 3 days of vertical growth. After 2 more days of growth at a 30° tilt and image capture, a line was traced along each root from the black mark to the tip to get primary root length (L). Then, a line was drawn directly from the black mark to the root tip to get the chord of growth, Lc. Dividing Lc by L gives an indication of the root's straightness along its growth trajectory. Angle B is calculated as the angle of root tip's displacement from the vertical, with the vertical being 0° and increasing to 90° as you move counterclockwise to the right. The trigonometric relationships between Lc and angle B allow the calculation of the Ly and Lx portions of the right triangle. Ly in a ratio with L gives the quantity known as vertical growth index (VGI), and similarly Lx divided by L gives horizontal growth index (HGI), an indication of root skewing.

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (w a) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where w a = (180− ɵ) π d /360. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### The apical angle: a mathematical analysis of the ellipse [^72ed30ec]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The elliptical excision is a common surgical procedure. The dermatologic literature predominantly describes an excisional geometry with a 3:1 length:width ratio and an apical angle of 30 degrees.

Objective

To analyze the elliptical excision by applying mathematical principles and define the apical angle and its relationship to the length:width ratio.

Methods

We examined numerous examples of elliptical excisions as presented in the dermatologic literature. We analyzed the geometry of the excisions and defined it mathematically.

Results

The apical angle of a 3:1 elliptical excision is not 30 degrees. The true apical angle varies from 37 degrees to 74 degrees depending on excisional geometry.

Conclusion

The commonly presented apical angle of 30 degrees is incorrect and does not reflect the true apical angle of elliptical excisions.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^92f468b4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the posteriorly inclined segment in the sagittal profile of the spine was hypothesized to be a risk factor for scoliosis development. In order to study this hypothesis, the length and tilt angle of the posteriorly inclined segment were analyzed on sagittal standing full-spine radiographs that were made before the onset of scoliosis. To capture both the length and the tilt angle, we developed the concept of the "posteriorly inclined triangle" (PIT) (Fig. 1). This triangle can have different shapes depending on the length and inclination of the hypotenuse, but its surface area is an expression of the overall magnitude of the posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors. This concept was first explored in a pilot study that included sample size calculations that we used in the current study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the sagittal shape of the spine before the onset of scoliosis can predict later scoliosis development in the population of patients with 22q11.2DS. We hypothesized that the children who ultimately develop scoliosis have more posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors acting on their spine, as expressed by a larger PIT area. In addition, we expected that the shape of the initial triangle (the inclination of the hypotenuse) determines which vertebrae are at risk for rotating into scoliosis, and is thus related to the ultimate type of scoliotic curve that develops.

### Egocentric neural representation of geometric vertex in the retrosplenial cortex [^0c6d4d3f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Egocentric vertex vector analysis

To analyze the egocentric bearing of the mouse to vertex (θego), the angle of the closest vertex relative to θallo at each sample point of behavior data was computed. θego was set to 0°, 90°, –180°/180°, and –90°, when the closest vertex is in front, right, back, and left to mice, respectively. Egocentric distance to vertex (Dego) was calculated by computing the distance from mice to the closest vertex at each sample point of behavior data. In order to analyze the tuning of egocentric bearing (θego) of RSC neuronal spikes (Fig. 2d), individual egocentric bearing tuning curves at each vertex were plotted by taking the normalized firing rate of spikes as a function of θego. For each vertex, spikes that were located within the half-length of edge from the corresponding vertex (triangle: 21.65 cm, square: 17.65 cm, and hexagon: 12.50 cm) were used in the tuning curve analysis. The egocentric bearing tuning curve was plotted using a 15° bin and smoothed using a moving average filter.

To analyze RSC neuronal spike firing characteristics in terms of θego and Dego, the egocentric vertex rate map was analyzed (Figs. 2, 3, 4, Supplementary Fig. 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22). The egocentric vertex rate map was plotted by calculating the firing rate in terms of θego and Dego in a polar coordinate in polar plot. θego was divided into 15° bins and egocentric distance was divided into 1.5 cm bins, which yielded 15° × 1.5 cm bins. Firing rates for each bin were calculated for each neuron, by dividing the number of spikes within a given bin by the whole time spent in the bin. Only the bin in which mice spent more than 133 ms (temporal resolution of behavior data) was included in the data analysis. Egocentric vertex rate maps were smoothed using 2D Gaussian kernel σ = 0.7 pixels.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Evidence-based diagnosis and treatment for uterine septum: a guideline [^23e6ff44]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

ASRM uterine anomaly definitions — normal/arcuate versus septate uterus — use indentation depth and angle thresholds: normal/arcuate is defined as depth from the interstitial line to the apex of the indentation < 1 cm and > 90°, whereas septate is defined as depth from the interstitial line to the apex of the indentation > 1.0 cm and angle of the indentation < 90°; the external fundal contour is smooth with < 1 cm indentation. In the septate uterus depiction, septum length > 1 cm and septum angle < 90°, while the normal/arcuate depiction shows arcuate distance ≤ 1cm and angle > 90° with the normal contour noted as flat.

### The rule of 57: orthopaedic trigonometry made easy [^2a37b853]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Rule of 57 is an easy method for planning osteotomies and calculating translations when correcting spine and limb deformities.

Methods

The rule is based on the mathematical principle that a circle with a radius of 57 mm has a circumference of 360 mm where each 1° of the circle subtends an arc of 1 mm in length.

Results

Thus a 1 mm opening or closing wedge osteotomy with a width of 57 mm would result in 1° of angular correction.

Discussion

This basic geometric shape can be extrapolated in many ways to determine proper alignment for preoperative planning, performing osteotomies, understanding guided growth, and executing a variety of deformity corrections.

### Muscle-sparing aortic coarctation repair [^8e4f4b4f]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient Inclusion

We performed a retrospective review of all consecutive neonates, infants, and children who underwent with a muscle-sparing aortic coarctation repair by a single operator between June 2002 and October 2004. We chose this cohort to ensure a minimum 4.5-year follow-up to assess musculoskeletal outcomes. This cohort was previously reported in our description of the technique and initial hemodynamic results. The exclusion criterion was a follow-up < 4.5 years.

Our research plan was accepted by the Swiss Ethics committee (protocol no. 2016–00713). The Swiss Ethics Committee approved that this study be carried out without consent forms thanks to article 34 of the Swiss federal law on human research. Regarding the pictures and the video of the patient, a proper consent form was obtained from the legal representative.

Surgical Technique

The surgical technique has been described in detail previously. The patient is positioned in a right lateral decubitus, turned slightly forward (Figures 1, A, and 2). The left arm is rotated forward and upward. The incision is made on the skin facing the so-called "triangle of auscultation", beginning 1 to 2 cm under the inferior angle of the scapula and directed posteriorly toward the spine (Figure 1, B). The length of the incision is related to the size of the patient, but in our series of neonates and small infants it never exceeded 5 to 6 cm. The subcutaneous tissue is undermined over an extensive area to allow visualization of the spinal insertion of the latissimus dorsi. At the beginning of our experience, the posterior part of the latissimus dorsi was divided over several centimeters. With further undermining of the subcutaneous tissue posteriorly, the entire muscle could be preserved, and this has been our approach ever since. The border of this muscle is detached from its aponeurosis for 6 to 7 cm, up to the tip of the scapula. One right-angle retractor is inserted below the latissimus dorsi and the serratus anterior, and another is inserted below the scapula. The loose tissue between the thoracic wall and the muscles is freed, allowing better visualization of the fifth intercostal space (Figure 1, C).

C and D, A circle was drawn through the position of the raphe A, the position of the nonfused commissure B, and the position of the nonfused commissure C and its center E was identified. Angle β is defined as the angle between the nonfused commissures |BE| and |DE| and center of the circle E. It represents the true commissural orientation in an ideal circle. E and F, The point E is the center of a circle drawn through the position of the raphe A, the position of the nonfused commissure B, and the position of the nonfused commissure C, whereas D is the coaptation point. The distance between these 2 central points |ED| was measured. In addition, 2 lines were drawn from the position of the raphe A to both center points E (line |AE|) and D (line |AD|) and were measured. Their difference in distance (|AE| – |AD|) was also determined and angle γ (red) between EAD was calculated. Two more angles were measured: the angle γ1 (light blue) was the angle between the nonfused commissure B, the position of the raphe A, and the coaptation point D, obtained drawing the segments |BD| and |AD|; the angle γ2 (light green) was the angle between the nonfused commissure and the position of the raphe A, obtained drawing the segments |CD| and |AD|. G and H, Reference angles. The point E is the center of a circle drawn through the position of the raphe A, the position of the nonfused commissure B and the position of the nonfused commissure C. Another 2 angles were measured: the angle ε1 (light blue) was the angle between the nonfused commissure B, the position of the raphe A, and the circle center E, obtained drawing the segments |BE| and |AE|; the angle ε2 (light green) was the angle between the nonfused commissure and the position of the raphe A, obtained drawing the segments |CE| and |AE|. To confirm the hypothesis of a rather constant position of the commissures between the right and the left cusp, and the left and the noncoronary cusp, ε2 should be a constant. NC, Noncoronary.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Cortices of fibula and tibia can provide landmarks for accurate syndesmosis fixation angle: computed tomography validation of angle bisector method [^3c850a92]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Anatomic syndesmosis reduction is necessary to restore ankle biomechanics and prevent poor clinical outcomes, but malreduction can be encountered frequently since the ideal fixation angle varies between patients and fixation levels. This study aimed to validate the angle bisector method to reveal whether it provides an accurate syndesmotic fixation angle that is patient- and level-specific. Lower extremity CT angiography of 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 25 female) without evident ankle pathology were evaluated. The average age was 52.8 (± 18, range: 18–75). Lines tangent to anterior and posterior cortices of tibia and fibula were drawn in the axial plane at both 2 cm and 3.5 cm above the ankle joint line. Bisection of the angle formed between these lines was drawn and its relationship with the centroidal axis, which is proposed to be the ideal syndesmotic axis, was evaluated. The angle between the bisector line & the centroidal axis and the distance between their most lateral intersections with the fibula were calculated. The measurements were made by 3 blinded observers. Intra- and interobserver reliability analyses were conducted. The average centroidal axis-bisector angle was 2.1° ± 2.1° at 2 cm and 0.6° ± 1.3° at 3.5 cm level. The average distance to the actual syndesmosis entry point was 1.0 ± 0.9 mm at 2 cm and 0.4 ± 0.4 mm at 3.5 cm level. The values didn't show any significant difference according to gender. Intra- and interobserver reliability analysis showed excellent correlation in all parameters (interclass correlation coefficient > 0.90). Angle bisector method was found strongly reliable providing accurate direction for syndesmotic axis. It can provide a patient- and level-specific angle for the application of syndesmotic implants without increasing the fluoroscopy exposure. Its use can have a broad impact on functional outcomes of ankle injuries by decreasing the malreduction rates. Further cadaveric validation and safety studies should be conducted for possible clinical usage.

### Lateral optical force on chiral particles near a surface [^b43e1f4f]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Light can exert radiation pressure on any object it encounters and that resulting optical force can be used to manipulate particles. It is commonly assumed that light should move a particle forward and indeed an incident plane wave with a photon momentum ħk can only push any particle, independent of its properties, in the direction of k. Here we demonstrate, using full-wave simulations, that an anomalous lateral force can be induced in a direction perpendicular to that of the incident photon momentum if a chiral particle is placed above a substrate that does not break any left-right symmetry. Analytical theory shows that the lateral force emerges from the coupling between structural chirality (the handedness of the chiral particle) and the light reflected from the substrate surface. Such coupling induces a sideway force that pushes chiral particles with opposite handedness in opposite directions.

### Shifting beams at normal incidence via controlling momentum-space geometric phases [^c6fe26a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Simulation results and discussion

To experimentally demonstrate the above approach of realizing lateral shifts, we scaled our design of the freestanding PhC slab to work in the near-infrared spectrum. The thickness t of the slab is chosen to be 100 nm, while the period of the etched array is a = 660 nm. The height h and baseline length w of the etched isosceles triangles are equal (h = w = 550 nm). All the parameters are freely chosen here only considering the ease of fabrication and changes will not affect the occurrence of the beam shifts. Fig. 2 a shows the calculated TE-like band of the structure along Γ-X and Γ-X′ directions (k y = 0 and k x = 0 respectively), where "TE" stands for transverse electric. The far-field polarization eigenstates of the radiative modes on the second TE-like band (TE 2) are shown in the form of polarization ellipses in Fig. 2 b. The red (blue) ellipses correspond to right-handed (left-handed) polarization states, and we marked out the circularly polarized points respectively with corresponding colored dots. It could be seen that the polarization structure and the normalized third Stokes parameters (S 3 / S 0) are mirror antisymmetric, and the major axes of the polarization ellipses are mostly horizonal. In other words, the normalized third Stokes parameter of the polarization eigenstates would change from negative to positive in the k x direction passing through a linearly polarized line (S 3 / S 0 = 0), while the normalized second Stokes parameter (S 2 / S 0) is kept near zero, as we expected. This polarization distribution is what we need to induce the momentum-space geometric phase gradients to the beam.

### The alpha angle [^dbd5e95c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

➢ The alpha angle was originally defined on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, using a plane, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. However, much of the literature on the alpha angle has used radiographs or other imaging modalities to quantify the alpha angle.➢ The measurement of the alpha angle can be unreliable, particularly on radiographs and ultrasound.➢ If radiographs are used to measure the alpha angle, the circle of best-fit method should be used on multiple different views to capture various locations of the cam lesion, and "eyeballing" or estimating the alpha angle should be avoided.➢ The cam lesion is a dynamic and 3-dimensional (3D) problem and is unlikely to be adequately defined or captured by a single angle.➢ Modern technology, including readily available 3D imaging modalities, as well as intraoperative and dynamic imaging options, provides novel, and potentially more clinically relevant, ways to quantify the alpha angle.

### How to steer active colloids up a vertical wall [^2403c061]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Experimental set-up

Gold particles of radius R = 0.8 μm were grafted with octadecanethioland half-coated with Platinum to form Janus microswimmers when immersed in hydrogen peroxyde (H 2 O 2). Due to their high mass density μ ≃ 11 g/cm 3, the particles immediately sediment onto the flat bottom of the experimental cell, forming a bidimensional monolayer of sedimented active particles. A very low in-plane apparent gravityis obtained by tilting the whole set-up with a small angle θ ≈ 0.1° in the z direction. An elongated borosilicate micropipette bent on the bottom of the observation cell and dipped into the 2D sediment acts as a lateral wall. We focus on the half-space on the right side of the wall. As the surface of the glass is charged, colloidal particles are repelled at short range and there is no solid contact or friction between particles and wall.

By tuning H 2 O 2 concentration from c 0 = 3.0 × 10 −4 v/v up to 5 c 0, it is possible to vary the activity of the colloid. In practice, for each experiment, we characterize this activity by measuring, from the sedimentation profile in the dilute regime, the sedimentation length λ 0 in the passive case and the sedimentation length λ for each active case. The Pe s is then determined by. This definition as been shown to be equivalent to the definition of the Péclet number from swim velocity. For each concentration in H 2 O 2, 3000 images of 2048 pixel × 2048 pixel are recorded at 5 fps using a Basler camera (ac-A2040-90 µm) mounted on a Leica DMI 4000B microscope and a custom-made external dark field and a 20× fluotar objective. The pixel size is 0.273 μm. We track the positions of the center of the particles using Trackpy toolkit on Python. We measure, within one pixel (30% of R) the most occupied position x m close to the glass wall. We set the origin of the x axis (x = 0) at 0.5 R before x m. We define the adsorption layer as the layer between x = 0 and x = L = 2 R. Note that the average equilibrium distance between particles is 2.4 R.

### Use of carotid ultrasound to identify subclinical vascular disease and evaluate cardiovascular disease risk: a consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography carotid intima-media thickness task force. endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine [^3defc215]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid ultrasound recommended scanning protocol for carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and plaque detection calls for a transverse B-mode scan 3–5 beat cine-loop extending from proximal CCA through middle of the internal carotid artery, followed by pulsed wave Doppler of the proximal 1 cm of each branch with an angle correction of ≤ 60 degrees. Longitudinal plaque screening acquires a 3–5 beat cine-loop from at least 3 different angles with probe rotation 90 degrees and circumferential anterior, lateral, and posterior planes to document plaque encroachment. CIMT imaging uses a 3–5 beat cine-loop and optimized R-wave gated still frames at each angle focused on the distal 1 cm of each CCA with 3 imaging planes and transducer depth usually 4 cm to minimize artifacts.

### Helicity-dependent single-walled carbon nanotube alignment on graphite for helical angle and handedness recognition [^0d909fe4]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Results

Theoretical calculations of the anchored SWNTs on graphite

A SWNT, such as the (10,0), (7,2)-R, (5,5) or (2,7)-L (where R and L represent the zigzag right and left handednesses, respectively)SWNTs shown in Fig. 1a, could be conceptually described as a hollow cylinder of a rolled-up graphene sheet (indicated by the rectangle). The wrapping vector (n, m) fully determines the diameter, helical angle and handedness of the SWNT. The (7,2)-R and (2,7)-L are the enantiomerswith a relationship of θ (7,2) + θ (2,7) = 60°, where θ is the helical angle of the SWNT. The van der Waals interaction between two graphite layers is strongest when their configuration is AB stacking. Similarly, the maximum interaction between a SWNT and graphite can be achieved if their interface has the similar AB stacking geometry (Fig. 1b–e). As such, the zigzag (10,0), chiral (7,2)-R and (2,7)-L and armchair (5,5) SWNTs prefer to be anchored along the perpendicular directions of the 0°+ i × 60°, 12.2°+ i × 60°, 47.8°+ i × 60° and 30 o + i × 60° on graphite, respectively (where i is an integer), as indicated by the red solid lines in Fig. 1a. In this way, the graphite has overwhelming advantages as a substrate to align SWNTs for both helical angle and handedness recognition.

### Quantification of the peripheral vitreous after vitreous shaving using intraoperative optical coherence tomography [^7042e7b6]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Quantification of residual vitreous using iOCT

Recorded iOCT findings were analysed by converting the still image from a movie (figure 1). The peripheral PVD, retina and vitreous base were visualised clearly and formed angles. In this study, we named this finding vitreoretinal angle. The amount of residual vitreous cortex was defined as the length of peripheral PVD measured from the vertex point of the vitreoretinal angle. The length of the peripheral PVD (figure 1, triangle) was measured in pixel with ImageJ software and calculated by OCT scale bar or scan depth.

3D TEE acquisition protocol for PFO and ASD — Three-dimensional transesophageal images of the interatrial septum (IAS) should be acquired from multiple views and multiple 3D imaging modes for analysis, and when evaluating the IAS using TEE, we recommend narrow-angled, zoomed, and wide-angled acquisition of 3D data. Recommended views/angles include the midesophageal short-axis at a multiplane angle of 0°, the basal short-axis starting at 30° to 60°, the bicaval view starting at the 90° to 120° multiplane orientation, the sagittal bicaval from the deep transgastric position with a transducer orientation of 100° to 120°, and the four-chamber view starting at 0° to 20°. In the bicaval view, with a 90° up–down angulation the left-sided septum can be seen in an en face perspective, and once acquired a 180° counterclockwise rotation will show the right side and the fossa ovalis; a gain setting at medium level is usually required to avoid the disappearance of the fossa ovalis and creating a false impression of an atrial septal defect (ASD).

### Tibial bowing in children-what is normal? A radiographic study [^f363d396]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define osseous landmarks on tibia radiographs in order to establish age-related normal values characterizing physiological tibial bowing in children.

Materials and Methods

Five hundred and twenty-six patients aged 0–17 years with normal radiographs of the lower legs were identified and retrospectively reviewed by two blinded radiologists. In anteroposterior (ap)/lateral (lat)-views, 3 lines defined tibial length and angulation. Line-A connecting proximal to distal corner of tibial metaphysic, lines B and C corresponding to corners of tibial metaphysis. Angle A/B defines proximal, A/C distal tibial-angulation. Tibial curvature is defined by distance of line-D parallel to A and tangential to tibial cortex. Normal values were calculated with linear-regression. Intra-/Interreader agreement were tested with a Bland-Altman-plot.

Results

Intrareader-agreement: Reader 1 showed a bias of -0.1, standard-deviation of bias was 1.9 and 95%-limits-of-agreement -3.9–3.7. Reader 2: -0.01, 2.4 and -4.7–4.7. Interreader: 0.2, 1.6 and -2.9–3.3. Angle-A/B ap was 80–100°, increasing with age (86.5–88); angle-AC ap was 82–107°(96.8–90.5), angle-AB lat was 81–107°(93.0–98.0); angle-AC lat was 76–102 (89.5–86.5); depth of curve ap was 0–11% (8–3.5) and lat 2–13%, (8.5–3.5).

Conclusion

Age dependent tibial bowing can be assessed with this new measurement system and age-related normal-values characterizing physiological tibial bowing in children is established.

Key Points

- Tibial Bowing is diagnosed on conventional radiographs.
- Existing Methods provide limited level of confidence.
- New methods provide easy to assess landmarks in all patient ages.
- Existing methods require higher radiation dose compared to new method presented.

### Quantitative analysis of intermuscular septa in the leg: implications for trauma surgery [^98424c73]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Error rates in performing lower extremity fasciotomy

Of the 151 fasciotomies performed at our medical center, 11 contained one or more missed compartments that necessitated a return to the OR to complete the compartments (representing a 7.3% error rate). Anterior and posterior deep compartments were the most commonly missed. Seven out of the 11 patients required reoperation to complete an anterior compartment decompression. There was an additional case of a missed lateral compartment, which conceivably also could have been related to the lateral/anterior septal position. Five of 11 reoperations involved the posterior deep compartments and only 1 involved the posterior superficial compartment.

Position of the intermuscular septum between anterior and lateral compartments

The average septum positional angle was 119.2° ± 17.5° (range 163.0 to 78.9, male/female pooled; figure 1C, D) at the 25% distal level, which is typically the most muscular part of the leg and 112.5° ± 15.2° (range 148 to 80.6) at 50% distance. Distally at the 75% location, the septum was significantly more anterior with an angle of 90.5° ± 13.8° (range 123 to 45.1). The positional angle was not significantly different between men and women (figure 1C, D).

As with angle measures previously mentioned, the arc segment circumferential length mean was 5.7 cm ± 0.81 cm (range 7.68 cm to 3.89 cm) at the 25% distal level, 5.34 cm ± 0.71 cm (range 7.1 cm to 3.90 cm) at the 50% distal level and 4.23 cm ± 0.63 cm (range 5.83 cm to 2.29 cm) at the 75% distal level. There were no significant differences between male and female patients. As both angle and arc length were consistent, thus for the correlations below only angle measures are described.

### Spatial orientation and mechanical properties of the human trachea: a computed tomography study [^0c526170]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The literature generally describes the trachea as oriented toward the right and back, but there is very little detailed characterization. Therefore, the aim of this study was to precisely determine the spatial orientation and to better characterize the physical properties of the human trachea.

Methods

We analyzed lung computed tomography scans of 68 intubated and mechanically ventilated subjects suffering from acute lung injury/ARDS at airway pressures (Paw) of 5, 15, and 45 cm H2O. At each Paw, the inner edge of the trachea from the subglottal space to the carina was captured. Tracheal length and diameter were measured. Tracheal orientation and compliance were estimated from processing barycenter and surface tracheal sections.

Results

Tracheal orientation at a Paw of 5 cm H2O showed a 4.2 ± 5.3° angle toward the right and a 20.6 ± 6.9° angle downward toward the back, which decreased significantly while increasing Paw (19.4 ± 6.9° at 15 cm H2O and 17.1 ± 6.8° at 45 cm H2O, P < .001). Tracheal compliance was 0.0113 ± 0.0131 mL/cm H2O/cm of trachea length from 5 to 15 cm H2O and 0.004 ± 0.0041 mL/cm H2O/cm of trachea length from 15 to 45 cm H2O (P < .001). Tracheal diameter was 19.6 ± 3.4 mm on the medial-lateral axis and 21.0 ± 4.3 mm on the sternal-vertebral axis.

Conclusions

The trachea is oriented downward toward the back at a 20.6 ± 6.9° angle and slightly toward the right at a 4.2 ± 5.3° angle. Understanding tracheal orientation may help in enhancing postural drainage and respiratory physiotherapy, and knowing the physical properties of the trachea may aid in endotracheal tube cuff design.

### Length redundancy and twist improve the biomechanical properties of polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts [^6616dbef]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

While adding redundancy to the graft length is highly effective at reducing tensile forces during lengthening and not detrimental to compressive forces during shortening, adding axial twist to the graft appears to cause increased tensile forces during path lengthening in the presence of low redundancy. Twist rotates material fibers away from being parallel to the axis of the graft, whereas axial extension requires these angled fibers to be realigned toward being parallel to this axis. This realignment requires shear strain between these angled fibers and thus additional axial tension. This is especially apparent in ring-reinforced grafts, which is consistent with their higher effective stiffness. Conversely, the presence of axial twist does not appear to substantially impact the required compressive force to shorten the path length of a graft.

The knee is usually placed in a flexed position during the performance of a below knee popliteal bypass graft anastomosis to allow adequate exposure through a medial approach. It is routine practice to allow some redundancy in the graft in anticipation of the additional length required when the knee is fully extended. Our results suggest adding additional amount of slack to a vascular graft in vivo could dramatically reduce tensile loads on the anastomotic sites during path lengthening. For example, during hip and knee extension, the straight path length of the iliofemoropopliteal vessels can increase by 10% or more, so that adding slack to the graft may benefit. The ∼1 N of repetitive tension caused even by 5% graft extension can be detrimental to the long-term durability of an anastomosis stability. Conveniently, this tensile load benefit is not sensitive to the exact amount of slack (in this study 5–15% slack was tested), so attention should be paid to providing enough slack with a little extra margin. This is especially important in the case of ring-reinforced grafts, which are designed to prevent kinking to maintain circular lumens, where slack is necessary to accommodate axial twist without causing increased tensile force on the graft anastomoses. As an added bonus, simultaneous slack and twist leads to a corkscrew shape of the graft, potentially improving hemodynamics. In addition, as up to 4.5°/cm of twist (equivalent to 90° of twist over a 20 cm graft length) did not cause appreciable changes in axial loads in the presence of sufficient slack, the amount of twist does not need to be very precise.

### Overcurvature describes the buckling and folding of rings from curved origami to foldable tents [^3f942d9a]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Creased paper rings are a third example of overcurved structures (Fig. 2c). In curved origami, paper is creased along closed curved paths, resulting in the out-of-plane bending of the folding path due to torsion. Simultaneously, the conservation of arc length by the two sides of the crease imposes an increase of the curvature of the crease by a factor O p = 1/cos(δ /2), where δ is the angle between the normals to the two sides of the crease (Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Figs S2 and S3; Supplementary equation S19). We creased a flat circular ring of paper along its median circle, and adjusted the degree of overcurvature by tuning the crease angle δ and holding it constant. After observations, the paper ring was cut and the number of turns in the formed coil was quantified to compute O p. This overcurvation process corresponds to increasing the local pre-set curvature while keeping the length constant.

Finally, to give a human-scale example of overcurved structures, arcs of wood of radius of curvature R = 1 m were combined with clamping collars to form closed continuous rings of square cross-section, with different magnitudes of the pre-set overcurvature. Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d and in Supplementary Fig. S4.

The overcurvation scenario is similar for all observed systems: the conformation starts from a circle at O p = 1 and buckles to a saddle shape with two pairs of upper and lower lobes for larger pre-set overcurvatures. The opposite lobes of the saddle then overlap close to O p = 2.5, and the ring finally debuckles to form a triple-coiled loop for O p = 3. All conformations have D 2d symmetry (for creased paper, this holds true only for the crease line). Although some issues are specific to each case, such as the cross-section rotation angle or the formation of wrinkles and lateral creases, the general scenario is identical for these systems, which cover almost five orders of magnitude in spatial scale, and for which the physical origin of overcurving differs sensibly. In the sequel, we concentrate on the general conformation of the centre lines of the rings (or of the crease lines for paper strips), and ignore details such as small wrinkles and lateral creases.

### Modified surface measurement method to determine catheter tip position of totally implantable venous access port through right subclavian vein [^a875649c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal catheter tip position of a totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is important to maintain its function and to avoid severe complications. In this study, we aimed to assess the reliability of a modified surface measurement method to determine optimal tip position of a TIVAP catheter inserted through the right subclavian vein.

Methods

Clinical and radiologic information of 105 patients who underwent TIVAP implantation through the right subclavian vein was collected retrospectively. The length of the implanted catheter was determined by a modified surface measurement method, as follows. The distance from the puncture point (point A) to the middle point of the sternal notch (point B), then from the middle point of the sternal notch (point B) to the middle point of Louis angle (point C) was added up. The equation for the catheter length is given by catheter length (cm) = AB + BC + 3. Postprocedure plain chest radiography (CXR) and enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) were used to check the catheter tip position and to calculate optimal position rate. Distance from the carina to the catheter tip and the length of the vertebral body unit were measured on both CXR and CT. Distances from carina to caval-atrial junction (CAJ) and from catheter tip to CAJ were measured on CT.

Results

Mean length of the implanted catheter of all patients was 17.0 ± 0.7 cm (male vs female, 17.3 ± 0.5 cm vs 16.7 ± 0.7 cm; P < .001). On CXR, a catheter tip located within 2.4 vertebral body units below the carina was identified as the optimal position, and the optimal position rate was 97.1% (102/105 cases). On CT, two definitions of optimal position were used: within 2 cm above or below the CAJ and within 2 cm above or at the CAJ; the optimal position rate was 92.4% (97/105 cases) and 78.1% (82/105 cases), respectively. Median follow-up time was 9.4 months. During the follow-up, no severe cardiac complication was recorded.

Conclusions

The modified surface measurement had high reliability in determining the optimal catheter length to accurately place the tip in the superior vena cava near the CAJ.

2.6 Statistics

Differences in anatomical MRI parameters among the pathologically and clinically diagnosed brain tissues were initially evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the adjustment for potential confounders, including age, sex, and brain weight. The assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals were tested prior to conducting ANCOVA, and no violations were detected. For significant findings from the initial group comparisons, pairwise post hoc t ‐tests were performed using the adjusted means derived from ANCOVA. The p values obtained from these pairwise t ‐tests were subsequently corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparisons. Specifically, this correction was applied to 5 × 6 comparisons across five MRI parameters in six pairwise group comparisons of AD neuropathological changes and 5 × 3 comparisons across the same five MRI parameters in three pairwise group comparisons of clinical AD diagnoses. Significant differences are denoted as *FDR‐corrected p value < .05 and FDR‐corrected p value < .01.

For participants aged ≥ 90 years, we only received information indicating that they were over 90 years old without access to their exact ages, following the guidelines provided by the local ethics committee. In the main analysis, these participants were treated as 90 years old. To ensure that this assumption did not introduce significant bias, a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the assumed ages (90, 95, and 100 years old). Additionally, to evaluate the robustness of the tractography‐derived measurements, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted by varying the tractography parameters. Specifically, the FA threshold (0.05, 0.10, 0.15), angle threshold (50°, 60°, and 70°), and minimum fiber length (4, 5, and 6 pixels) were adjusted to assess their effects on PP fiber counts and lengths.

### The esophageal hiatus: what is the normal size? [^a3a5d725]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A hiatal hernia is defined as the protrusion of intra-abdominal organs through a dilated esophageal hiatus. The esophageal hiatus and its function have been described extensively, but an exact anatomical determination of its normal size is lacking. It seems important to define the normal size, as crural closure is an important part of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal or paraesophageal hernias. The aim of this study was to determine normal values for the size of the esophageal hiatus.

Methods

In a prospective study 50 consecutive cadaver autopsies were performed between February and May 2008. The subjects had died from several diseases not related to GERD. Size of the esophageal hiatus was measured after opening the abdominal cavity before extirpation of any organs. Distance of the cardia and gastroesophageal junction and position of the angle of His were further measured. A formula was used to calculate the hiatal surface area (HSA). Results were analyzed regarding subject height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and chest circumference.

Results

In all 50 cadavers (24 male/26 female) the autopsy was performed and all measurements were obtained. Mean age was 74 years (40–90 years), mean height was 1.68 m (1.39–1.83 m), mean weight was 71 kg (40–120 kg), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25 kg/m(2) (14–40 kg/m(2)). Mean chest circumference was 101 cm (75–178 range). Mean HSA was 5.84 cm(2) (3.62–9.56 cm(2)). In all cadavers the gastroesophageal junction was intraabdominal, the mean distance to the angle of His was 3.6 cm (2.7–4.6 cm), the mean length of the right and left crura was similar at 3.6 cm (2.7–4.6 cm), and the opening segment had a mean length of 2.4 cm (1.7–4.0 cm).

Conclusion

The mean HSA was determined in these normal subjects to be 5.84 cm(2). It was directly proportional to chest circumference and independent of height, weight, BMI, and gender.

Here, we determine the evolution of the peak curvature of a fold modeled by a parabola, where ϕ 0 is the initial peak position, κ p (0) is its initial peak curvature, l and k are two initially orthonormal vectors, and Δ s is the arc length per angle of the initial parameterization at ϕ 0. In a sufficiently small range of ϕ around ϕ 0, the velocity field can be linearized. Then the parabolic shape is preserved and the dynamics of l and k in the Lagrangian frame is determined by the velocity gradient, By (2), the curvature of the fold is given byOver time, l (t) and k (t) cease to be orthogonal and the curvature peak position is shifted. Minimizing the denominator yields the new peak positionThe new peak curvature is therefore given bySince l and k behave like passive vectors, their dynamics can be described by the deformation tensorwhere X (x, t) is the Lagrangian map. The singular value decomposition of F, defines the orthonormal basesandand the finite-time Lyapunov exponents ρ i (t) bywhere Λ is diagonal. Expanding l (0) and k (0) in the v j -coordinate system yieldsObserving that F (t) l (0) = l (t) and F (t) k (0) = k (t), and applying the deformation tensor to the previous equations, we getInserting these expansions into (30) yieldsAs long as the infinite-time Lyapunov exponents (the t → ∞ -limits of the FTLEs) are distinct from each other, we will havefor large t. Assuming furthermore that the random coefficients in (35) are non-zero, we can drop those terms with slower exponential growth:While the FTLEs are known to converge slowly, V (t) and thus a i (t) and b i (t) converge exponentially fast. We therefore have (cf. ref.)for some effective initial peak curvaturewhich may differ from the actual initial peak curvature κ p (0) depending on the relative orientation of the initial parabola and the converged basis vectors.

### Influence of stent edge angle on endothelialization in an in vitro model [^5f49a58c]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the influence of topographic features in the path of migrating endothelial cells, specifically the effect of edge angle of intravascular metallic material on endothelialization.

Materials and Methods

Flat 1-cm x 1-cm 316-L pieces of stainless steel were placed on confluent monolayers of human aortic endothelial cells. The thickness of each metal piece was ground to achieve an edge angle of 35 degrees, 70 degrees, 90 degrees, or 140 degrees (n = 6 each) in relation to the endothelial surface. Migration distance and density of endothelial cell coverage on the metal pieces were measured in groups of six each under static conditions at 4, 7, and 11 days and flow conditions (16 dynes/cm(2)) at 4 days.

Results

Endothelial cell migration distance along the surface of the pieces with edge angles of 35 degrees was significantly greater than that with those with larger angles (P < .05) under static and flow conditions. The migration distances on the 35 degrees piece were 87.5%, 47.3%, 57.1%, and 66.1% greater than those on the 90 degrees piece at the upstream, downstream, right, and left edges, respectively. There were no significant differences in cell density among different angle groups under flow or static conditions.

Conclusion

The edge angle of intravascular metallic material has an influence on the rate of endothelialization. A smaller edge angle facilitates endothelialization over metallic material when compared to a larger angle. These results demonstrate the importance of metallic stent profile on endothelialization rate.

Doppler-based hemodynamic estimation — key technical limitations: The document cautions that "Doppler measurements are angle dependent and require optimal alignment (< 20° Θ angle), requiring interpretation of the highest velocity across multiple optimized imaging windows", and that "Errors in gain settings may also affect the accuracy of hemodynamic measurements. Overgaining can exponentially amplify the measured pressures, while undergaining low can lead to inadequate detection of the Doppler signal".

### Geometric characteristics of bicuspid aortic valves [^9b9b43c6]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We studied the coaptation angles α and β in bicuspid aortic valve geometry from computed tomography scan images.

Methods

In 45 patients, we calculated the coaptation angle α (the angle between the nonfused commissures crossing the center of coaptation), angle β (between the nonfused commissures crossing the center of the reference circle), angles γ 1 and γ 2 and ε 1 and ε 2 (angle between the nonfused commissures and the coaptation point at the raphe or the perfect midpoint, respectively), the length of the raphe, the absolute and relative sinuses' surfaces (relative to the perfect circle and the percentage exceeding the ideal circle). Spearman correlation was employed to investigate the associations among all parameters.

Results

The coaptation angles α and β were significantly different (P < .001). We found a significant correlation of α with the length of the raphe (P = 0.008), whereas β was dependent on the position of the commissures. Both γ 1 and γ 2 (P = 0.04), or ε 1 and ε 2 (P < .001) significantly differed from each other and ε 2 was the most constant angle, although its size geometrically depends on β. The noncoronary was the largest sinus, and β was the primary determinant of its increased size in bicuspid aortic valves with righ/left fusion pattern.

Conclusions

The coaptation angle α is influenced by the length of the raphe, whereas angle β is dependent on the position of the commissures. The position of the raphe can vary and is not always situated in the middle of the free edge. The position of the right/non commissure is variable, whereas the right/left commissure is more fixed.

### Emergent biaxiality in chiral hybrid liquid crystals [^b57ae5cb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The colloidal orientations, representing the normal direction of the disk or the long axis of the rod, are analyzed based on its projections on multiple two-dimensional (2D) optical slices of a 3D sample using ImageJ software (freeware from the National Institute of Health). The ensuing data are transferred to Matlab software for visualization as well as for further analysis. The contrast and brightness of the images are carefully adjusted to avoid the interference of colloids out of focus. From the 3D stacks of images, the-slice plane perpendicular to the helical axisgives the azimuthal orientational distribution (φ), whereas the vertical slice plane parallel toreveals the polar distribution (θ) of colloidal orientations. We follow the methodology described in detail in refs. – and perform a complete analysis of angles describing the colloidal orientations relative to the helical far-field background by imaging the entire sample volume. After the analysis of particles by ImageJ, average azimuthal colloidal orientations are calculated for the data obtained in eachslice plane and plotted against the sample depth (z) position of the cross-sectional plane, revealing the helical twist of the colloidal axes. The corresponding helical pitch p of each 3D volume is subsequently calculated from the slope of the linear dependence of the azimuthal angle on the vertical position (d φ / d z = q = 360°/ p) and is in agreement with the initially designed value mentioned above, confirming the undisturbed molecular helical pitch at relatively low colloidal concentrations. Finally, the colloidal orientation distribution is visualized in the cholesteric frame as follows: the azimuthal angle in the molecular coordinate is calculated by subtracting the molecular twist from the measured colloidal orientations, δ = φ − q z representing the fluctuation of colloidal orientation around that of a perfect helix. The non-orientable property of the colloidal axisenabled us to express the fluctuation angles, δ = δ + π, for example, within a [-90°,90°] range. Histograms of the angular probability distribution with 5° bin width are calculated for each fluctuation angle, and numerical fitting based on the theoretical model is performed to each distribution accordingly and the peak width is quantified at half peak height (full width at half maximum, FWHM). The fit function is justified from the analytical prediction for the angular dependence of the surface anchoring energy (Eq. (20) and Eq. (23) below) and the elastic energy Eq. (4) discussed in the sections below. The visualization of angle distributions is cropped to a smaller angle range after calculation performed in the full [-90°,90°] range. The histogram data sets are subsequently utilized in the computation of the colloidal orientation order parameters, as summarized in the Results.

### Straight ahead in spatial neglect: evidence that space is shifted, not rotated [^8202a623]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The egocentric reference appears to be altered in neglect patients, as evidenced by an ipsilesional error when pointing straight ahead. In this study, patients with right brain damage used a horizontal rod to show this straight-ahead direction. There was a systematic rightward translation of the rod, and no clockwise rotation occurred in five of six neglect patients. The results suggest a preferential rightward translation of space representation in neglect.

### A novel approach to reduce breast radiation exposure with coronary CTA: angled axial image acquisition [^c90e3418]. Academic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To determine whether angled gantry acquisition might be used to image the heart with a shorter scan length and reduced breast exposure during coronary computed tomography angiography.

Materials and Methods

One hundred consecutive coronary computed tomography angiography examinations of female patients were retrospectively evaluated to define the angle between the long axis of the left heart and the axial imaging plane. The scan length required to image the entire left ventricle along with the coronary arteries was measured for an axial scan plane as well as for a scan plane parallel to the long axis of the left heart. The overlap between these imaging volumes and the lower portion of the breast was measured.

Results

The long axis of the left heart varied from 7 degrees to 54 degrees off the axial plane (mean 32 degrees ± 7 degrees). The required scan length to include the entire left ventricle and coronary arteries ranged from 8.2 to 12.4 cm (mean, 10.0 ± 0.9 cm) for the axial scan plane and 5.6–10.1 cm (mean, 7.5 ± 0.8 cm) for a scan plane parallel to the long axis of the heart (P < .001). cCTA in the axial plane required a 7.4 ± 1.6 cm overlap with the lower breast, whereas cCTA in the long axis of the heart reduced the overlap to 4.5 ± 1.8 cm (P < .001).

Conclusions

Using an angled gantry approach, the coronary arteries can be fully imaged in a plane along the long axis of the left heart with a single 10-cm acquisition and with substantial reduction in amount of breast tissue within the irradiated field.

### How does contact length impact titanium tapered splined stem stability: a biomechanical matched pair cadaveric study [^ecc42d00]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Titanium tapered stems (TTS) achieve fixation in the femoral diaphysis and are commonly used in revision total hip arthroplasty. The initial stability of a TTS is critical, but the minimum contact length needed and impact of implant-specific taper angles on axial stability are unknown. This biomechanical study was performed to better guide operative decision-making by addressing these clinical questions.

Methods

Two TTS with varying conical taper angles (2° spline taper vs 3.5° spline taper) were implanted in 9 right and left matched fresh human femora. The proximal femur was removed, and the remaining femoral diaphysis was prepared to allow for either a 2 cm (n = 6), 3 cm (n = 6), or 4 cm (n = 6) cortical contact length with each implanted stem. Stepwise axial load was then applied to a maximum of 2600N or until the femur fractured. Failure was defined as either subsidence > 5 mm or femur fracture.

Results

All 6 femora with 2 cm of stem-cortical contact length failed axial testing, a significantly higher failure rate (P < .02) than the 4 out of 6 femora and all 6 femora that passed testing at 3 cm and 4 cm, respectively, which were not statistically different from each other (P = 0.12). Taper angle did not influence success rates, as each matched pair either succeeded or failed at the tested contact length.

Conclusion

4 cm of cortical contact length with a TTS demonstrates reliable initial axial stability, while 2 cm is insufficient regardless of taper angle. For 3 cm of cortical contact, successful initial fixation can be achieved in most cases with both taper angle designs.

Normal subjects presented with a middle number and two left- and right-sided outer numbers overestimate the numerical distance between the middle number and that positioned at its left side. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right posterior parietal cortex specifically counteracts this bias, suggesting that the mental representation of space defined by numbers is shifted toward the left side depending on a greater activity of the right hemisphere.

Aortic annulus measurement orientation and pitfalls: Correct measurement uses a centrally positioned diameter and central closure of leaflets with the long axis of the ascending aorta providing orthogonal orientation of the annular diameter; incorrect approaches include eccentric annular measurement with hinge points slightly displaced upward and not corresponding to the nadir of cusp attachments, and oblique annular measurement; the annulus is "virtual" and only defined by the hinge-points of the three aortic valve leaflets, with its plane approximately perpendicular to the long-axis of the aorta; attempting to measure 2 hinge-points typically measures within the sinuses of Valsalva and overestimates the annulus.

### Chiral structures of electric polarization vectors quantified by X-ray resonant scattering [^ffa78f0e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To better explain the actual experimental data, we consider the random fluctuation of the polarization vector mentioned previously. The variables that determine the random fluctuation include the fluctuation amplitudeand the coherence length. In order for the amplitudeto have a clear effect on the AR curve, it must be greater than the magnitudeof the displacement vector of Ti 4+ atom (Fig. 1b–e). This case is excluded because it violates the assumption of small fluctuation, and the amplitude is fixed to. On the other hand, the shorter the coherence length, the smaller the amplitude of the AR at higher q z and the smoother the slope of the AR curve can be seen. The best fit in Fig. 4n is when the coherence lengthcorresponds to 50 unit cells. Comparing with the periodicity of a polar vortex array that is 28 unit cells, it can be seen that at least one supercell formed of a vortex pair maintains a coherent shape.

### Is a right angle the right angle? Normal coronal radiographic alignment in the pediatric finger phalanges [^25eb284c]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Quantifying pediatric phalanx fracture displacement requires understanding the normal radiographic alignment of pediatric phalanges, which has never been assessed in the coronal plane, although prior studies have assumed the articular surfaces and physes to be perpendicular to the diaphyses. This study tests the hypothesis that these relationships are not uniformly perpendicular and instead vary by digit and age.

Methods

Normal hand bone age radiographs were retrospectively reviewed from 40 males and 40 females 2 to 18 years old. For each finger proximal phalanx (P1) and middle phalanx (P2), 2 raters each measured twice the angle between the diaphysis and distal articular surface (D-DA), diaphysis and physis (D-P, when physis present), and diaphysis and proximal articular surface (D-PA). Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients. 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each angle for each digit, phalanx, age group, and sex to determine which angles ~90 degrees. Variability among ages and sex was assessed with analysis of variance.

Results

Intra-rater and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficients were > 0.90, except in P2 ∠D-DA in children under 8 years old with unossified P2 condyles. Overall, only 173 (47.8%) of 362 confidence intervals included 90 degrees. Three angles of the small finger (P1 ∠D-DA, P2 ∠D-P, P2 ∠D-PA) never ~90 degrees at any age or sex, with an average 10 degrees ulnar tilt of the small finger proximal interphalangeal joint. Of the 24 angles across digits and phalanges, 10 varied significantly with age, especially in the index and middle finger P1 where initially wedge-shaped epiphyses progressively became more symmetric with age.

Conclusions

The coronal radiographic angles between the phalangeal diaphyses and articular surfaces or physes differ from 90 degrees more than half the time in pediatric fingers, and nearly half the angles vary by age. These findings demonstrate that the articular surfaces and physes of the pediatric finger phalanges are not uniformly perpendicular to the diaphyses, underscoring the need to consider the variability among digits, phalanges, ages and subjects.

### Predicting phase behavior of grain boundaries with evolutionary search and machine learning [^026fa1f6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Energy map of GB phases. Evolutionary search and clustering identify new ground states and multiple grain boundary phases. The search explores different atomic densities and finds low-energy grain boundary configurations (green circles) ignored by the conventional methodology. For each grain boundary (angle θ) atomic fractions and energies of different grain boundary phases at 0 K are indicated by blue triangles (Kite family), red diamonds (Split Kite family) and orange squares (Extended Kite family)

Low-angle boundaries near the 0° and 90° are composed of periodic arrays of isolated edge dislocations. The evolutionary search results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the dislocation core structure can be represented by multiple atomic configurations that generally also require grand-canonical optimization: atoms have to be added or removed from the dislocation core. The multiple dislocation core configurations are examples of 1D phases, referred in the recent literature as 1D complexions. Different core structures and transitions may have a strong effect on dislocation mobility.

Angle Alpha Magnitude

The angle alpha magnitudes in both right and left eyes displayed notable positive skewness, evidenced by skewness values of 0.32 and 0.50, respectively. For the right eye, the mean angle alpha magnitude was 0.31 ± 0.19 mm with a median of 0.29 mm. The 25th and 75th percentiles were 0.16 mm and 0.44 mm, respectively (Figure 3a). In contrast, the left eye showed a mean magnitude of 0.27 ± 0.18 mm and a median of 0.24 mm, with the 25th and 75th percentiles at 0.12 mm and 0.38 mm, respectively (Figure 3b).

In this figure, "ns" indicates no significance (p > 0.05), and * indicates p < 0.001.

Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, which indicated that the distribution of Angle Alpha magnitude between the left and right eyes did not follow a normal distribution (p < 0.05). A statistically significant correlation was observed in the mean Angle Alpha magnitudes between the left and right eyes (Spearman correlation analysis, p < 0.001). Additionally, a statistically significant difference was found in the mean Angle Alpha magnitudes between the left and right eyes (p < 0.001).

Orientational analysis revealed that in the right eye, the angle alpha magnitudes were 0.64 ± 0.11 mm (superior), 0.14 ± 0.15 mm (nasal), 0.60 ± 0.06 mm (inferior), and 0.33 ± 0.19 mm (temporal). In the left eye, the magnitudes were 0.63 ± 0.12 mm (superior), 0.14 ± 0.14 mm (nasal), 0.59 ± 0.05 mm (inferior), and 0.28 ± 0.18 mm (temporal), as depicted in Figure 3c. Notably, the mean angle alpha magnitudes in the temporal and inferior regions were larger in the right eye than in the left eye (p < 0.001).

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^581288e1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Aortic root and annulus measurement — multiplane alignment and timing: Two-dimensional echocardiographic planar measurements may incorrectly estimate true aortic annulus size if the LAX view does not bisect the maximum diameter of the aortic root, and a well-aligned LAX view bisects the left noncoronary commissure posteriorly and the right coronary cusp anteriorly; the optimal sagittal dimension measurement plane aligns with these landmarks. On 3D echocardiography, the sagittal plane annular measurement is 2.3 cm, but the largest dimension is the coronal plane. Two-dimensional aortic diameter measurements are preferable to M-mode, which results in systematic underestimation (by 2 mm) compared with the 2D aortic diameter. The aortic annular diameter may be measured in diastole between the hinge points of the AV leaflets (inner edge to inner edge) in LAX views that reveal the largest diameter, but for valve sizing before transcatheter or surgical valve replacement, the measurement should be performed in systole. Color flow Doppler may be important in abnormalities such as aortic dissection or intramural hematomas.

### Treating acid reflux without compressing the food passageway: 4-year safety and clinical outcomes with the refluxStop device in a prospective multicenter study [^6ee4b447]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

The most important factor in predicting success of the RefluxStop procedure is the positioning of the device: in proximity to the esophagus and with its entire body above the upper edge of the LES (Fig. 3). As such, the upper edge of the device should be positioned at least 4 cm above the angle of His. To achieve such a satisfactory position, certain steps must be followed. Hernia reduction and free dissection of the esophagus is performed initially without esophageal traction to ensure at least 2.5 cm of intraabdominal esophagus; then, gentle downward traction is applied to intraabdominally mobilize the esophagus 1.5–2.5 cm further down while dissection continues superiorly in the mediastinum (i.e. preferably all the way to the venae pulmonalis). Traction is only applied to simplify dissection and increase intraabdominal esophageal length, but not to stretch the esophagus for additional length. Thus, this procedure includes extensive mediastinal dissection to achieve 4–5 cm of tension-free intraabdominal esophagus.

Fig. 3
The device correctly positioned above the lower esophageal sphincter

The gastric fundus also requires dissection in achieving a floppy tension-free fundus to match the length of the freely dissected esophagus. It is recommended to divide at least three of the short gastric arteries, as well as perform a posterior dissection inferiorly on the fundus all the way around to the angle of His to achieve a floppy fundus, to be able to subsequently perform a tension-free plication. Plication of the fundus and esophagus is performed on the patient's left side between the vagal trunks and on at least 90° of the esophageal circumference. When performing the plication, suturing of the fundus to the esophagus should be done with 1 cm of downward traction applied to the esophagus, if needed, to achieve 5 cm of plication length. Once this plication has been completed, all relevant structures usually descend 1 cm inferiorly to the desired locus that helps maintain the ARB in a normal physiologic position.

### What is the best method for reporting tumor diameter in vestibular schwannoma? [^5b15c243]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Various methods have been used to report the tumor diameter of vestibular schwannomas. To clarify the most appropriate method to represent the tumor volume, tumor diameters according to various measuring methods were statistically compared with the actual tumor volume.

Methods

Tumor volume was measured by three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state images in 52 unselected vestibular schwannomas. Pearson's correlation coefficient was obtained between the tumor volume and various tumor diameters, such as diameter parallel to the petrous edge (a); a pons-to-petrous diameter (b); ab, a maximum diameter of the portion in the cerebellopontine angle cistern (max CPA); a maximum diameter of the whole tumor (Max); and a diameter through an axis of the internal auditory canal (Axis). The tumors were divided into three groups on the basis of tumor volume, as follows: Group I (small, < 0.5 cm(3)), Group II (medium, 0.5–2 cm(3)), and Group III (large, > 2 cm(3)).

Results

Max and Axis correlated best with the tumor volume in Group I and correlated least with the tumor volume in Group II. Any of these measurements was acceptable in Group III tumors. The max CPA consistently revealed good correlation with the tumor volume in all three tumor groups.

Conclusion

The max CPA measurement is the simplest and most appropriate way to represent the tumor volume in unselected tumors. Max or Axis is better only when small tumors (< 0.5 cm(3) in volume) are being assessed-that is, those with a max CPA of less than 1 cm.

### Using the magnetoencephalogram to noninvasively measure magnetite in the living human brain [^61ff5697]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Some of the calibration arrowmaps (of the many we recorded for visual study) are shown in Figure 3. From these maps, we learned how to estimate the magnetite distributions in the actual subjects, by looking at their arrowmaps on‐line, to make rapid recording decisions (e.g. should we wash his head again?) The subjects' patterns can also be calculated by forward modeling, as we have done, to lend confidence.

Figure 3
Calibration arrowmaps due to a 5‐μg sample of magnetite dust, placed at various z ‐distances along a central radius, and oriented at two different angles. (a): Z = 0 cm, θ = 0°. (b): Z = 7.0 cm. θ = 0°. (c): Z = 7.0 cm, θ = 90 0. Z = 0 is located at the air‐fiberglass interface, z = 7.0 is at location of most particle inverse locations. The gain in (a) has been reduced a factor of 10, compared with the gain in (b) and (c), because the arrows are so large, at this z; thusis actually 1,020. Θ is the angle between the dipole and the z ‐axis. We ignore the second angle, because the first angle Θ makes almost no difference to. By turning through various angles, the pattern in c becomes, for example, close to the arrowmap recorded pattern in Figure 2 d lower [Color figure can be viewed at]

2.4.2 Preliminary information: The calibration curve

This preliminary is necessary in step 4. Our calibration curve isversus z, at a particular dipole angle, for 5 μg of magnetite dust. The calibration curves at different angles fortuitously are within 10% of each other, from which we made a master curve, and accept a 5% maximum error due to angle. The calibration curve we used is shown in Figure 4. From this curve we will find the mass which produced the arrowmap. We make a horizontal line at the appropriatevalue, and run it out horizontally to, say, z = 7 cm. We then ask: how many samples of 5 μg, to reach that point vertically? For example, in this case it is 2.2 samples, yielding a total clump mass of 11.7 μg, for the 89 y/o subject.

An engineered heart-shaped optical polarization singularity sheet (λ 0 = 532 nm) profiled at various transverse planes.

The columns are, from left to right, experimental polarization azimuth Ψ, simulated polarization azimuth Ψ, experimental ellipticity angle θ, simulated ellipticity angle θ, experimental intensity (s 0 Stokes parameter) profile, and simulated intensity profile. Black and white ellipses in the azimuth plots indicate the local polarization ellipses. Black ellipses indicate left-handed elliptical polarization and white ellipses indicate right-handed elliptical polarization. The experimental optical field was produced by a polarization-sensitive metasurface. The images are captured at different displacements z from the metasurface along the propagating direction. The diagonal fringes in the experimental plots are artifacts arising from light diffracting around an iris in the optical path.

Double oblique aortic computed tomography — Multiplanar reformatted images in different planes obtained from a computed tomographic aortogram correspond to the axial source image and can show an elliptical descending aorta; the sagittal and coronal correlates show the reference planes and the tortuosity of the aortic segment, which results in a distorted shape, and correcting the plane in both sagittal and coronal images to achieve perpendicularity to the aortic flow results in a corrected true transversal image of the aortic lumen that is circular.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for peripheral artery disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, patients at risk, AACVPR/ABC/ACC/AHA/APMA/SCAI/SIR/SVM/SVN/SVS/VESS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining screening for PAD with resting ABI, with or without ankle pulse volume recordings and/or Doppler waveforms, in patients at increased risk of PAD:

- aged ≥ 65 years

- aged 50–64 years, with risk factors for atherosclerosis (such as diabetes, history of smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension), CKD, or family history of PAD

- aged < 50 years, with diabetes and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis

- patients with known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (including coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal, mesenteric artery stenosis, or AAA).

Ultrasound probes for laparoscopic ultrasound — early transluminal probes used via ports produced a 360° image with 1–4 cm depth and were enveloped in a sterile plastic sheath filled with saline but were cumbersome with poor image quality; dedicated linear array probes address many issues, and ideally the probe should have a diameter of less than 10 mm to allow introduction through an 11 mm laparoscopic port, should be 35–50 cm long to allow access to all locations in the abdominal cavity, and commonly have frequencies of 5–10 MHz with depth of penetration of approximately 4–10 cm; a flexible tip will allow for improved scanning angles.

### Correct depth of insertion of right internal jugular central venous catheters based on external landmarks: avoiding the right atrium [^3c17aa50]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiographically, a central venous catheter (CVC) tip should lie at the level of the right tracheobronchial angle. Precalculation of length of CVC insertion may avoid unnecessary catheter malposition. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a method of CVC positioning, based on external topographic landmarks.

Design

A prospective, randomized study.

Setting

University-affiliated hospital, single institution.

Participants

Patients scheduled for surgery.

Interventions

Patients were allocated for insertion of the catheter through the right internal jugular vein to either a fixed, predetermined, 15-cm length (n = 50) or to a depth calculated topographically (n = 50) by drawing a line from the level of the thyroid notch to the sternal manubrium. The catheter was repositioned if its tip was situated > 5 cm above the carina or > 1 cm below it. The distance from the catheter tip to the carina was measured. The main study endpoint was the need for catheter repositioning.

Measurements and Main Results

Two percent of patients required repositioning in the topographic group compared with 78% in the 15-cm length group (p < 0.001). No patient in the topographic group and 10 patients (20%) in the 15-cm group had the catheter placed in the right atrium (p < 0.05). The mean distance from the CVC tip to the carina was 2.9 ± 1.4 cm above the carina in the topographic group and 1.9 ± 1.1 cm below the carina in the 15-cm length group (p < 0.001). No patient had a too proximally placed catheter. Insertion lengths in the topographic group ranged between 9 and 12.5 cm.

Conclusions

It is recommended to use the topographic approach in deciding CVC depth with right internal jugular CVC placement.

FIGURE 1
A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

FIGURE 3
A and B, Lateral photographs of a 50-year-old woman before and 1 month after her last electromagnetic treatment. The authors have used a convenient grid to allow measurements. The abdominal profile is reduced by 1.88 cm (6.8%). The upper thigh, which is outside the treatment area, is reduced by 1.25 cm (6.0%). Adapted from Leone et al.

Half of the studies included measurements of abdominal circumference. The mean reduction in waist circumference was 3.5 cm (range, 0.4–5.9 cm), with a follow-up of 1 to 3 months. The original study using this device for body shaping measured waist circumferences in 19 patients 3 months after the fourth treatment. The mean pretreatment waist circumference was 88.0 ± 11 cm, compared with 83.6 ± 11 cm at 3 months, representing a reduction of 4.4 cm. The error bars were wide and overlapping. This large degree of variance reduces the significance of the difference. A t test performed by the author yields a P value of 0.23. The vertical axis in the authors' graphic starts at 70 cm, enhancing the apparent magnitude of the reduction.

### Where is the "straight ahead" in spatial neglect? [^15449944]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

We investigated the subjective straight-ahead (SSA) projection of body-midline parts (head and trunk) in patients with neglect and patients with nonneglect, using a method disentangling lateral shift and lateral tilt components of the bias. Patients with neglect showed a similar counterclockwise SSA tilt for each body part and an ipsilesional lateral shift, more severe for the trunk than for the head. Thus, neglect results in a tilt of the body midline representation.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular isovolumic acceleration (RV IVA) — measurement and use: RV IVA (myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction) is described as a relatively load independent measure of global RV systolic function that correlates with severity of illness, but available data are limited and the measurement is angle dependent and varies with age and heart rate. In studies in patients with conditions affected by RV function, RV IVA may be used and, when used, it should be measured at the lateral tricuspid annulus; RV IVA is not recommended as a screening parameter for RV systolic function in the general echocardiography laboratory population, and because of the broad confidence interval around its lower reference limit, no reference value can be recommended.
