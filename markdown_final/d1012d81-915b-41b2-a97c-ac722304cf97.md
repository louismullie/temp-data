## Question

Trichomonas vaginalis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis, including first-line therapy, population-specific dosing, alternatives, pregnancy considerations, partner management, resistance strategies, and follow-up testing recommendations [^115CqZg1] [^11488KRC] [^112GEJDK] [^115PQwis] [^1171dAb8]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the antibiotic class that is first-line and whether multiple agents are acceptable. Then, I should determine recommended regimens for women versus men and the rationale for the CDC's shift toward a 7-day regimen in women. Next, I will verify special populations such as HIV-infected women and pregnant patients. After that, I should review alternatives like tinidazole and secnidazole, including when to use them and any alcohol restrictions. Then, I will address partner therapy, management of treatment failure and resistance, and when to consider susceptibility testing. Finally, I need to confirm follow-up and retesting practices and summarize practical adherence considerations and diagnostic testing strategy [^115CqZg1] [^11488KRC] [^112GEJDK] [^111VNU6f].

> Let me first confirm the first-line antibiotic class. All major guidelines converge on 5-nitroimidazoles as first-line therapy, specifically metronidazole and tinidazole, and increasingly include secnidazole as an option where adherence to multidose regimens is a concern, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations in those agents [^115CqZg1] [^112GEJDK] [^115PQwis] [^1171dAb8].

> Wait, I initially recalled single-dose metronidazole as "standard" for women, but let me verify the most current recommendation. The CDC 2021 guidelines recommend metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as first-line for women, and this is supported by randomized data showing superior cure with the 7-day multidose regimen versus the 2 g single-dose regimen in nonpregnant, HIV-uninfected women, so the 7-day course should be my default in women unless adherence is a major barrier [^11488KRC] [^113hTRS5] [^111VNU6f].

> Hold on, for men the guidance differs, so I should double-check that before concluding. For male patients, the CDC endorses single-dose therapy with metronidazole 2 g orally as first-line, with tinidazole 2 g as an acceptable alternative, which fits typical patterns of asymptomatic infection and the need to ensure completion in a single observed dose when feasible [^113o9tb4] [^115CqZg1] [^115hqpFE].

> I should confirm the approach in women with HIV, because failure rates historically differ. In women with HIV, the CDC recommends metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as mandatory first-line, and data suggest higher failure with single-dose therapy among those on ART, reinforcing the preference for the 7-day regimen in this population [^115zacrg] [^114DvLTn] [^111VNU6f].

> Next, I will examine alternatives and special circumstances. Tinidazole 2 g orally once is an alternative first-line agent with a longer half-life and favorable tolerability, and it can be particularly useful after metronidazole failure given low observed tinidazole resistance and activity against some metronidazole-refractory isolates, though cost and availability may limit use in some settings [^115CqZg1] [^115hqpFE] [^1155tXCH] [^113nNMgf]. Secnidazole 2 g single dose is FDA-approved for trichomoniasis, has a long half-life, and demonstrated high cure rates in a phase 3 trial, making it a reasonable option when adherence to multidose therapy is doubtful and alcohol restrictions are problematic, noting WHO includes it where adherence is a serious concern and recent data suggest no alcohol restriction for secnidazole based on in vitro studies [^1171dAb8] [^1161tjAD] [^112GEJDK] [^111wKJp1].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I need to be careful and reconcile mixed evidence. Guidelines generally recommend treating symptomatic pregnant patients, with WHO 2024 favoring metronidazole 400–500 mg twice daily for 7 days and many experts avoiding single 2 g dosing in pregnancy due to higher transient serum levels and placental transfer, especially avoiding treatment in the first trimester unless the benefits clearly outweigh risks, given older trials suggesting possible harm in certain contexts and no reduction in preterm birth with metronidazole [^115PQwis] [^1127irLL] [^113qTjAk] [^115ohGkK]. Let me reconsider the practical takeaway: if treating during pregnancy, prefer multidose metronidazole in the second or third trimester and individualize decisions in the first trimester, documenting risk–benefit discussion and symptom burden [^115PQwis] [^1127irLL].

> Next, I should review partner management because reinfection risk is high. I need to ensure all sexual partners are treated concurrently using expedited partner therapy where allowed, as partner infection prevalence is high and most male partners are asymptomatic, which reduces reinfection and community transmission [^115CqZg1] [^112xUasi] [^113uUFua].

> I will now examine management of treatment failure and suspected resistance. If symptoms persist or NAAT remains positive after ensuring no re-exposure, re-treat with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days if not used initially, then consider higher-dose nitroimidazoles such as tinidazole for suspected resistance, and seek susceptibility testing through CDC when available because low-level metronidazole resistance exists even though tinidazole resistance remains rare in surveillance data [^115CqZg1] [^116tzp9v] [^1155tXCH] [^117ACqaE]. For true nitroimidazole hypersensitivity, desensitization to metronidazole is effective and preferred over intravaginal alternatives, which have lower cure rates and more local adverse effects, but I should confirm allergy history carefully before proceeding [^1155bhMn].

> I need to ensure a sound follow-up plan. A routine test of cure is not required in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults after effective therapy, but all women should be retested at approximately 3 months because reinfection is common, and symptomatic or persistent cases warrant evaluation at about 4 weeks with NAATs when available to differentiate failure from reinfection and to guide further therapy [^115CqZg1] [^111VNU6f]. Let me verify that NAAT is preferred for its superior sensitivity over wet mount or culture, which supports both initial diagnosis and retesting when clinically indicated [^111VNU6f].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach before treatment to avoid mismanagement. NAATs on vaginal swabs or urine are highly sensitive and recommended for diagnosis in women, and modern assays allow testing in men as well, which is helpful given high asymptomatic carriage and historical diagnostic limitations in males, so confirming infection with NAATs where feasible improves care and surveillance [^115eerEw] [^111VNU6f] [^1148douX].

> Let me consider adherence and practical circumstances to individualize regimen choice. When adherence to a 7-day regimen is unlikely, such as in emergency department settings or where follow-up is uncertain, a single-dose regimen using metronidazole, tinidazole, or secnidazole can be justified to ensure treatment completion, acknowledging that in women the 7-day metronidazole regimen has superior efficacy and should be used whenever adherence is feasible [^112GEJDK] [^1122BST5] [^111wKJp1].

> I need to ensure counseling includes alcohol and drug interaction considerations without overstatements. Patients taking metronidazole or tinidazole should avoid alcohol during therapy and for at least 24 hours after metronidazole and 72 hours after tinidazole due to disulfiram-like reactions, whereas secnidazole does not carry a similar restriction per current data, and all nitroimidazoles warrant review of concomitant medications for interactions and clear contraceptive and sexual abstinence guidance until both partners complete therapy and symptoms resolve [^114yUGwt] [^115hqpFE] [^1171dAb8].

> Let me summarize to ensure internal consistency. First-line remains a nitroimidazole: for women, metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is preferred based on CDC guidance and RCT data, for men, metronidazole 2 g once is standard with tinidazole 2 g once as an alternative, and for HIV-infected women, the 7-day metronidazole regimen is required, with partners treated concomitantly and women retested at 3 months to detect reinfection, adjusting to tinidazole or seeking susceptibility testing when failure suggests resistance and considering secnidazole for adherence-challenged scenarios [^11488KRC] [^113o9tb4] [^115zacrg] [^115CqZg1] [^1161tjAD].

---

The recommended treatment for Trichomonas vaginalis is **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** for women, including pregnant women, and **metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose** for men [^11488KRC] [^113o9tb4] [^112GEJDK]. Tinidazole **2 g orally as a single dose** is an alternative for both sexes [^115CqZg1]. For HIV-positive women, the 7-day metronidazole regimen is preferred [^115zacrg]. Partners must be treated simultaneously to prevent reinfection, and abstinence from sexual activity is advised until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve. Retesting is recommended **3 months after treatment** due to high reinfection rates [^111VNU6f].

---

## Recommended first-line treatments

### Women

For women, the **first-line regimen** is **metronidazole** 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^11488KRC] [^115PQwis]; if adherence is a concern, a single 2 g dose is an **alternative** [^115PQwis].

---

### Men

For men, **metronidazole** 2 g orally as a single dose is **first-line** [^113o9tb4].

---

## Partner treatment and prevention of reinfection

To prevent reinfection, treat sexual partners simultaneously (**partner treatment**) [^112xUasi], and advise **abstinence** from sexual activity until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve.

---

## Follow-up and retesting

Retesting is recommended **3 months after treatment** due to high reinfection rates [^111VNU6f].

---

## Side effects and contraindications

Regarding side effects and contraindications, **common side effects** include nausea, metallic taste, gastrointestinal upset, headache, and dizziness; **contraindications** include hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles, with caution advised in pregnancy (especially the first trimester).

---

Metronidazole is the **first-line treatment** for Trichomonas vaginalis, with tinidazole and secnidazole as alternatives. Partner treatment and retesting are essential to prevent reinfection.

### Diagnosis and management of Trichomonas vaginalis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^111VNU6f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are more than four times more likely to be infected than persons of other races.

Since the publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men.

Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at three months after treatment is recommended.

In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for seven days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at the one-month test of cure.

### Solosec [^1171dAb8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

SOLOSEC® is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for:

- **Indications and usage**:
	- Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in female patients 12 years of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].
	- Treatment of trichomoniasis in patients 12 years of age and older. Trichomoniasis, caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis*, is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae. Therefore, treat partners of infected patients simultaneously to prevent reinfection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Usage**:
	- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SOLOSEC and other antibacterial drugs, SOLOSEC should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111m47AQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by two types of key questions: informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines, and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms Mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion, and all authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis in men [^114yCFTN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### Likmez [^115YQ43b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Likmez is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic trichomoniasis caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis* in adult females and males when the diagnosis is confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures. It is also indicated for asymptomatic trichomoniasis caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis* in adult females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, sexual partners of patients should be treated simultaneously to prevent re-infection.

Likmez is also indicated for the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amoebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess in adults and pediatric patients. In cases of amebic liver abscess, treatment with Likmez does not replace the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1161tjAD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of secnidazole compared to placebo in women with trichomoniasis. Women diagnosed with trichomoniasis through a positive T. vaginalis culture were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of secnidazole 2 g or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the microbiological test of cure (TOC) by culture conducted 6–12 days after dosing. At the TOC visit, participants received the opposite treatment and were monitored for infection resolution, with additional treatment offered at subsequent visits if necessary. Approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups was achieved with fifty patients per group (N = 100).

Between April 2019 and March 2020, 147 women were enrolled at 10 sites in the United States. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included 131 randomized patients (secnidazole, n = 64; placebo, n = 67). Cure rates were significantly higher in the secnidazole group compared to the placebo group for the mITT population (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%–97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0%–8.0%]) and for the per-protocol population (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%–98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI: 0%–8.9%]). Among women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cure rates were 100% (4/4), while those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) had a cure rate of 95.2% (20/21). Secnidazole was generally well tolerated, with the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each 2.7%). No serious TEAEs were observed.

### Sexual intercourse association with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis treatment in relationship to preterm birth [^115yhB2R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether sexual intercourse was associated with treatment efficacy or the incidence of preterm birth in two large randomized trials in which metronidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis did not reduce preterm birth.

- **Study design**: Secondary analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on Gram stain or asymptomatic Trichomonas vaginalis on culture were randomized at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation to metronidazole or placebo. In both studies, women took 2 g of metronidazole or placebo in the presence of a nurse (first dose) and were given a second dose to take 48 hours later. This regimen was repeated (third and fourth doses) at 24 to 29 weeks. At the time of the third dose, bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis specimens were collected again. Patients who were randomly selected to receive metronidazole were analyzed for bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis at 24 to 29 weeks and for preterm birth of less than 37 weeks of gestation, according to intercourse between first and second doses and between the second and third doses. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, or the Mantel-Haenszel test of trend.

- **Results**: Sexual intercourse between the first and second doses or between the second and third doses did not influence the incidence of bacterial vaginosis (18% vs 24%; relative risk, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1; and 23% vs 20%).

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115eWUnQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In light of these practical realities, empirical single-dose oral tinidazole treatment of both bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis (TV), with single-dose fluconazole, would offer a patient-centered solution to optimize the chance for first-time cure, particularly for women challenged by medication adherence and follow-up capability. Currently, the 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines recommend a 2-gram single-dose tinidazole (as four 500-mg tablets) for TV treatment and 2 grams on Days 1 and 2 as an alternative BV treatment option. Due to emergency department dispensing limitations, the next day's dose would require the patient to fill a prescription.

The 2-gram single-dose tinidazole is already recommended as an alternative treatment of both BV and TV by the European International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI), World Health Organization (WHO), and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) U.K. guidelines. Tinidazole's plasma half-life is 12–14 hours, which is longer than metronidazole's (~8 hours), allowing for a shorter treatment course, and its safety profile is less adverse, with metallic taste, nausea, anorexia, and constipation associated with longer-duration, as opposed to single-dose treatment. TV also exhibits less resistance to tinidazole than metronidazole, demonstrating both lower in vitro minimum lethal concentrations and a high clinical efficacy rate for patients with metronidazole-refractory TV infection.

### The influence of ART on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis among HIV-infected women [^114DvLTn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Among women who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+), both prevalent and persistent infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common. TV has been shown to increase vaginal shedding of HIV, which may influence HIV sexual and perinatal transmission, making prevention important. In one cohort of HIV+ women in Kenya, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, mostly nevirapine-based, was associated with lower cure rates of TV for single-dose therapy. Our goal was to replicate this study in a US-based cohort of HIV+/TV+ women and compare outcomes to those with multidose therapy.

- **Methods**: A secondary data analysis was performed on a multicenter cohort of HIV+/TV+ women who were randomized to single-dose (2 grams) or 7-day (500 mg twice daily) multidose metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. The test of cure visit, via culture, occurred 6–12 days after treatment completion. Information was collected on sex partner treatment and sexual exposures. Persistent TV infection rates were compared for women on ART at baseline versus not on ART.

- **Results**: Of the 226 women included, those on ART had more treatment failures than women not on ART (24/146 [16.4%] vs. 5/80 [6.3%]; p = 0.03). When stratified by treatment arm, more treatment failures were seen in the single-dose arm (17/73 [23.3%] vs. 3/39 [7.7%]; p = 0.05) than in the multidose arm (7/73 [9.6%] vs. 2/41 [4.8%]; p = 0.39).

- **Conclusions**: ART usage was associated with a higher TV persistent infection rate among those receiving the single-dose treatment but not the multidose, providing more evidence that multidose should be the preferred approach.

### Development of PCR assays for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in urine specimens [^111L3XVM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections are usually asymptomatic or can result in nonspecific clinical symptoms, which makes laboratory-based detection of this protozoan parasite essential for diagnosis and treatment. We report the development of a battery of highly sensitive and specific PCR assays for detection of T. vaginalis in urine, a noninvasive specimen, and development of a protocol for differentiating among Trichomonas species that commonly infect humans.

### Management of trichomonas vaginalis in women with suspected metronidazole hypersensitivity [^1155bhMn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for Trichomonas vaginalis is metronidazole or tinidazole. Hypersensitivity to these drugs has been documented but is poorly understood. Desensitization is an option described in limited reports of women with hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles. The purpose of this analysis is to improve documentation of management for trichomonas infections among women with metronidazole hypersensitivity.

- **Study design**: Clinicians who consulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning patients with suspected hypersensitivity to metronidazole were provided with treatment options and asked to report outcomes.

- **Results**: From September 2003 to September 2006, complete information was obtained for 59 women. The most common reactions were urticaria (47%) and facial edema (11%). Fifteen of these women (25.4%) were treated with metronidazole desensitization and all had eradication of their infection. Seventeen women (28.8%) were treated with alternative intravaginal drugs, which were less successful; 5 of 17 infections (29.4%) were eradicated.

- **Conclusion**: Metronidazole desensitization was effective in the management of women with nitroimidazole hypersensitivity.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116M6RWB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are a leading cause of primary care visits for women. Individuals exhibiting symptoms often receive laboratory testing based on clinic-specific standards of care. Thus, women seen at a family practice clinic might only receive a vaginitis workup, whereas those seen at a sexually transmitted diseases clinic could be more likely to receive only sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.

- **Methods**: The likelihood of STIs was assessed in women from whom samples were tested for vaginitis using a molecular diagnostic assay. Positivity rates for *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, and *Trichomonas vaginalis* DNA, detected using the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay, were calculated. Concordance between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay for detection of *T. vaginalis* was determined.

- **Results**: Women with bacterial vaginosis alone or with *Candida spp.* infections had high rates of coinfection with sexually transmitted infections (24.4%-25.7%); samples from women who were negative for vaginitis had significantly lower positivity rates (7.9%; *P* < .001). *Trichomonas vaginalis* results were concordant between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay in 559 of 560 samples tested.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest, as have other studies, that women with vaginitis symptoms may be at risk for an STI. Molecular testing could provide broad diagnostic coverage for symptomatic women and improve patient management, regardless of the type of clinic in which patients are treated.

### Trichomoniasis: The "neglected" sexually transmitted disease [^112rvjLv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States. Although trichomoniasis is common, it has been considered a "neglected" sexually transmitted disease due to limited knowledge of its sequelae and associated costs.

This article reviews epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, clinical management recommendations, and special considerations regarding trichomoniasis. Additionally, it addresses research on associated conditions and costs, prevention strategies, and controversies surrounding the disease.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^116qNPzr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Although there are no official guidelines or recommendations for testing in men, if testing becomes readily available, then those guidelines may change, and male partners of females diagnosed with infection can be offered testing with urine or urethral swabs to confirm diagnosis prior to treatment. The clinical significance and utility of the penile meatal swab is currently unknown, although this sample has been shown to have potential utility in a number of studies for the detection of other STI pathogens, such as N. gonorrhea. The collection process for penile meatal swabs may also be more comfortable for patients compared with urethral swab collection.

The high performance of the vaginal swab samples collected in cobas PCR medium indicates that this sampling method is the optimal specimen type for use with the cobas CT/NG assay, which should facilitate ease of testing during a patient clinic visit. Only one sample tested positive with the APTIMA TV alone, in an asymptomatic female patient, who would have been defined by PIS as infected.

As noted, both the clinician-collected and self-collected male meatal and female vaginal swab samples were highly sensitive and specific. This is very important, as self-testing can increase the likelihood that patients will access testing. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising incidence of STIs, it may be increasingly important in enabling patients to access medical care and diagnosis.

The prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in this study, at 15.8% in female subjects and 2.3% in male subjects, was higher than some previous estimates.

### What's new in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis [^115iKS42]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Most importantly, there is a recognition of different subgroups of women with BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications.

New diagnostic tests may soon be available, enabling women to test self-obtained specimens. However, treatment of BV has lagged behind, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

### Reversible optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole [^111zAuEk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic used in treating anaerobic bacteria and protozoal infections. It was first licensed for the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis but is now used in the management of various gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections. Many neurological side effects are well documented, although there is scarce literature illustrating optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole. We describe a case report of a 36-year-old man who presented with symptomatically reduced central visual loss on a background of a 2-year history of metronidazole use for a perianal fistula. Electrophysiology demonstrated bilateral optic neuropathy, with pattern visual evoked potential traces demonstrating marked latency and small amplitude responses of the P100 waves, which improved to within normal limits on cessation of metronidazole. This case study demonstrates clinical and electrophysiological reversibility of optic neuropathy secondary to high-dose and prolonged metronidazole use.

### Tindamax [^115hqpFE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of several conditions:

	- **Trichomoniasis**: Caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, tinidazole is indicated for treatment. Proper diagnostic procedures should identify the organism. Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

	- **Giardiasis**: Tinidazole is used to treat giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

	- **Amebiasis**: Tinidazole treats intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients over three years old. It is not indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

	- **Bacterial vaginosis**: Tinidazole is used in adult women to treat bacterial vaginosis (formerly known as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^117ACqaE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Inconsistency does exist between in vitro susceptibility results and clinical outcomes of treatment, particularly for infections with low-level in vitro resistance. Clinical resistance and treatment failure have occurred with T. vaginalis isolates for which the MLCs of nitroimidazoles were as low as 12.5 µg/mL. Conversely, treatment success has occurred in infections with T. vaginalis isolates for which the MLCs of nitroimidazoles were 100–200 µg/mL. In general, elevated MLCs are associated with a greater likelihood of treatment failure. A recent evaluation of the utility of susceptibility testing in women for whom clinical treatment has failed found that treatment recommendations based on susceptibility results may have a beneficial role in informing the clinical management of some women with persistent infection. T. vaginalis susceptibility testing is not available routinely; such testing should be conducted by a qualified laboratory and is available at the CDC (1–800-INFO).

As a cross-sectional evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial drug susceptibility, the study was not designed to detect clinical treatment failures. Multiple isolates were collected from 17 women; however, we did not systematically collect data on sexual re-exposure after treatment or adherence, so we were not able to determine whether any of these cases resulted from treatment failure. The MLCs of metronidazole for the initial isolates were low, suggesting that clinical resistance was unlikely. In two cases, the initial isolate exhibited low-level resistance (MLC of metronidazole 50 µg/mL) and a second isolate was obtained.

### Management of women with cervicitis [^1168x6dP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In recent years, the understanding of cervicitis has evolved beyond Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as the primary etiological suspects. Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus are also known to cause cervicitis. Additionally, Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis have emerged as new candidate etiological agents or conditions. However, significant gaps remain in the knowledge of this common condition, as many women with cervicitis have no identified putative etiologic agents. Furthermore, cervicitis occurs in a relatively small proportion of women with chlamydia or gonorrhea.

Research on the clinical response of nonchlamydial and nongonococcal cervicitis to antibiotic therapy is scarce. There is also a lack of data on the benefits of sex partner treatment for such women. Consequently, new research into the etiology, immunology, and natural history of cervicitis is necessary, especially given the well-established links between cervicitis, an increased risk of upper genital tract infection, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 acquisition.

### Disparities in adherence to retesting guidelines in women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^115RSLtV]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Numerous studies have shown disproportionately higher prevalence rates in non-Hispanic Black women. Because of the high rates of reinfection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends retesting women treated for trichomoniasis. Despite these national guidelines, there are few studies examining adherence to retesting recommendations for patients with trichomoniasis. Adherence to retesting guidelines has been shown in other infections to be an important determinant of racial disparities.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to describe Trichomonas vaginalis infection rates, evaluate adherence to retesting guidelines, and examine characteristics of women who were not retested according to the guidelines in an urban, diverse, hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic population.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from a single hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic who were tested for Trichomonas vaginalis between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to examine guideline-concordant testing for reinfection among patients with trichomoniasis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with testing positive and with appropriate retesting. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients who were pregnant and tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis.

- **Results**: Among the 8809 patients tested for Trichomonas vaginalis, 799 (9.1%) tested positive.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^1148douX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Diagnosis has historically relied on either microscopic analysis or culture, the latter being the previous gold standard. However, these tests are not readily available for male diagnosis, generally only perform well for symptomatic women, and are not as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Men are largely asymptomatic but carry the organism and transmit it to their sexual partners.

This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the performance of the cobas T. vaginalis/Mycoplasma genitalium (TV/MG) assay for detection of T. vaginalis DNA compared with patient infection status (PIS) defined by a combination of commercially available NAATs and culture using urogenital specimens. A total of 2,064 subjects (984 men and 1,080 women; 940 [45.5%] symptomatic, 1,124 [54.5%] asymptomatic) were evaluable.

In women, sensitivity ranged from 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.8 to 99.9%) using vaginal samples to 94.7% (95% CI 90.2 to 97.2%) in PreservCyt samples. Specificity ranged from 98.9 to 96.8% (95% CI 95.4 to 97.8%). In men, the cobas TV/MG assay was 100% sensitive for the detection of T. vaginalis in both male urine samples and meatal swabs, with specificity of 98.4% in urine samples and 92.5% in meatal swabs.

The cobas TV/MG is a suitable diagnostic test for the detection of T. vaginalis, which could support public health efforts toward infection control and complement existing STI programs.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^113qTjAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis affects women during pregnancy as well; however, it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing anti-trichomonas agents during pregnancy were included. Trials that involved symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis were deemed eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

- **Main results**: We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials, around 90% of the women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the U.S. trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies, identified for the update, because they did not address the primary question.

- **Authors' conclusions**: Metronidazole, given as a treatment in pregnancy, has not proven effective in reducing the risks associated with trichomoniasis and may pose additional risks.

### Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114yUGwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2019 to examine recent literature addressing updates in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STIs. This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen tests for trichomoniasis: A meta-analysis [^113keLkU]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis is a globally prevalent sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan *Trichomonas vaginalis*. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosing trichomoniasis, but it is expensive. Antigen tests are immunochromatographic immunoassays that detect *T. vaginalis* membrane proteins. Despite being user-friendly and rapid, the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests remains uncertain. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for *T. vaginalis* infections.

- **Materials and methods**: We mined the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for *T. vaginalis*. We included studies that provided diagnostic test accuracy data in order to conduct a meta-analysis. We evaluated antigen tests based on immunochromatography and lateral flow devices. The meta-analysis was conducted using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model.

- **Results**: Eleven studies with 5,884 samples were included. The meta-analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 87.0% and a pooled specificity of 98.3%. A subgroup analysis employing PCR as the reference standard yielded a sensitivity of 58.5%, whereas another subgroup analysis using culture returned a sensitivity of 95.9%. The subgroup analysis of 6 studies comprising 2,328 specimens from symptomatic individuals yielded a pooled sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.9%.

- **Conclusions**: The antigen tests exhibited high sensitivity and specificity.

### Effectiveness of two tinidazole regimens in treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111NtLG5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of tinidazole administered orally at doses of 1 g once daily for 5 days and 2 g once daily for 2 days compared with placebo. The assessment was conducted 21–30 days after treatment for bacterial vaginosis, using rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended criteria to define cure.

A total of 235 women at 10 U.S. centers participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Diagnosis or cure of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence or absence of five criteria:
1. Clue cells constituting at least 20% of squamous cells in microscopic examination of vaginal fluid.
2. Positive potassium hydroxide whiff test.
3. A homogeneous, thin, white-gray vaginal discharge.
4. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5.
5. Nugent score of 4 or greater on Gram-stained vaginal fluid.

Compliance, tolerability, and safety were assessed using patient diaries and interviews at intervals of 8–10 days and 21–30 days after treatment. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical analysis with Bonferroni adjustment was used for outcome comparisons.

Superior efficacy was demonstrated for the tinidazole regimen of 1 g once daily for 5 days (36.8% cured, p < 0.001, number needed to treat 3.2) and for the 2 g once daily for 2 days regimen (27.4% cured, p < 0.001, number needed to treat 4.5) when compared with placebo (5.1% cured) in the primary endpoint analysis. Efficacy was greater when using more traditional criteria for cure. Compliance with study therapy and tolerability were comparable across all treatment groups.

### Use of an immunochromatographic assay for rapid detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in vaginal specimens [^115aZcYt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is estimated to be the most widely prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the world. Wet-mount microscopy is the most common diagnostic method, although it is less sensitive than culture. The OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, Mass.) (referred to here as OSOM) is a new point-of-care diagnostic assay for T. vaginalis that uses an immunochromatographic capillary flow (dipstick) assay and provides results in 10 minutes. The purpose of this study was to determine the test characteristics of OSOM compared to those of a composite reference standard (CRS) comprised of wet-mount microscopy and T. vaginalis culture.

This multicenter cross-sectional study enrolled sexually active women aged 18 years or older who presented with symptoms of vaginitis, exposure to T. vaginalis, or multiple sexual partners. Vaginal-swab specimens were obtained for T. vaginalis culture, wet mount, and rapid testing. The prevalence of T. vaginalis in this sample was 23.4% (105 of 449) by the CRS. The sensitivity and specificity of OSOM vaginal-swab specimens were 83.3% and 98.8%, respectively, while wet mount had a sensitivity and specificity of 71.4% and 100%, respectively, compared to the CRS.

OSOM performed significantly better than wet mount (P = 0.004) and detected T. vaginalis in samples that required 48 to 72 hours of incubation prior to becoming culture positive. The performance of the rapid test was not affected by the presence of coinfections with chlamydia and gonorrhea. The OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test is a simple, objective test that can be effectively used in clinical settings.

### Tinidazole therapy for metronidazole-resistant vaginal trichomoniasis [^113nNMgf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with metronidazole-refractory vaginal trichomoniasis constitutes a major therapeutic challenge, and treatment options are extremely limited. Although the majority of patients infected with trichomonads who demonstrate reduced in vitro susceptibility to metronidazole respond to high-dose but poorly tolerated regimens of metronidazole, clinical failure is by no means uncommon. We report a cure rate of 22 (92%) out of 24 patients with refractory trichomoniasis treated with high doses of oral and vaginal tinidazole. This series included 15 cases with increased in vitro minimal lethal concentration values of metronidazole.

Tinidazole, despite the high doses used, was extremely well tolerated, with few side effects. Topical paromomycin was effective in 7 (58%) of 12 patients treated, but frequent local vulvovaginal adverse reactions precluded extensive use. Widespread reports of metronidazole resistance and limited treatment options emphasize the need for additional trichomonacidal agents.

### Metronidazole treatment of women with a positive fetal fibronectin test result [^115HYxcH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Eighty-nine women with either bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginalis, or both, who also had a positive fetal fibronectin test result, were randomized to two courses of metronidazole treatment. This was part of a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network Units study of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In this subgroup analysis, compared with the placebo group, women who were treated with metronidazole had a nonsignificant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth from 14.6% to 8.3%.

### Validation of a urine-based PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for use in clinical research settings to detect Trichomonas vaginalis in men [^114DUtmx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with urethritis, prostatitis, and urethral strictures in men. However, the natural history and importance of T. vaginalis in men are poorly understood, in part because of difficulties in diagnosing infection. Traditional detection methods rely on culture and wet-mount microscopy, which can be insensitive and time-consuming. Urethral swabs are commonly used to detect T. vaginalis in men, but discomfort from specimen collection is a barrier to large studies.

One thousand two hundred twenty-five Malawian men attending sexually transmitted disease and dermatology clinics were enrolled in this cross-sectional study to validate detection by urine-based PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with urine and urethral swab culture as the reference standard. This assay for detection of amplified T. vaginalis DNA in first-catch urine (≤ 30 ml) performed with a sensitivity of 92.7%, a specificity of 88.6%, and an adjusted specificity of 95.2% compared to culture of urethral swabs or urine sediment. For clinical research settings in which urethral swabs are not available and culture is not feasible, the urine-based PCR-ELISA may be useful for detection of trichomoniasis in men.

### Prevalence of trichomonas vaginalis infection among US males, 2013–2016 [^112knKWo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis results from the adhesion of *Trichomonas vaginalis* to the mucous membrane of the urethra or vagina. It has been estimated to have a higher incidence rate than both gonorrhea and chlamydia combined. Although females can experience both clinical symptoms and obstetrical complications, male infections are largely asymptomatic and often unreported. We aim to estimate the prevalence of trichomoniasis in US males using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database.

- **Methods**: The NHANES database was queried for all men aged 18–59 years during the years 2013–2016. During these years, the survey included urine testing for trichomoniasis using transcription-mediated amplification. Information was also obtained regarding patient demographics and other sexually transmitted infections.

- **Results**: Overall, 0.49% of men aged 18–59 years tested positive for trichomoniasis. The highest rate was seen in black men (3.6%). There was no significant association between trichomoniasis and age. Higher rates of infection were seen in smokers, those with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, men who had sex at an early age, those with less condom usage, and those with more lifetime sexual partners.

- **Conclusion**: The rates of trichomonas infection in US males are lower than in women. Infections are strongly associated with black males, HSV-2 infection, and other factors known to increase rates of sexually transmitted infection. This information may be helpful for counseling, screening, and management of patients.

### Treatment of trichomonas in pregnancy and adverse outcomes of pregnancy: a subanalysis of a randomized trial in Rakai, Uganda [^111NRtsh]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association of presumptive Trichomonas vaginalis treatment during pregnancy and birth outcomes.

- **Study design**: A community-randomized trial of presumptive sexually transmitted disease treatment during pregnancy was conducted between 1994 and 1999 in the Rakai district, Uganda. A subanalysis of a trial of presumptive therapy with azithromycin, cefixime, and metronidazole assessed Trichomonas vaginalis treatment in pregnant women.

- **Results**: Children of 94 women with Trichomonas who were treated had an increased low birth weight (relative risk, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.12–5.50), preterm birth rate (relative risk, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.81–2.02), and 2-year mortality rate (relative risk, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.99–2.52), compared with children of 112 women with Trichomonas who were not treated.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis during pregnancy may be deleterious, and we infer that this may be due to metronidazole. This is consistent with a National Institute for Child Health and Human Development trial that found an excess of preterm births in children of women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection who were treated with metronidazole.

### Single-dose versus 7-day-dose metronidazole for the treatment of trichomoniasis in women: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113hTRS5]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the United States. We included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was T. vaginalis infection by intention to treat at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status.

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as the risk of BV recurrence and the side effect profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate BV recurrence rates and rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

- **Methods**: Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females aged 12–50 who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments (single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole) were compared for rates of BV recurrence (reBV) and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Overall, the rate of BV recurrence (2.7%) and VVC post-treatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

### The association between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and level of vaginal lactobacilli, in nonpregnant women [^115Fjniy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The effect that vaginal lactobacilli have on trichomoniasis is not known. At three clinics for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, we recruited 521 female patients with trichomoniasis and 176 control subjects. All participants underwent physical examinations, testing for sexually transmitted infections, and completed questionnaires. Low levels of vaginal lactobacilli were associated with trichomoniasis (odds ratio [OR], 2.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.4–3.2]).

After adjustment for covariables, this association remained significant in women with a higher educational level (OR, 4.6 [95% CI, 2.2–9.5]) but not in women with a lower educational level (OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.7–3.4]). Vaginal lactobacilli may be associated with trichomoniasis in women with higher levels of education or a related behavioral factor.

### Re-evaluating the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis: Emphasizing emerging pathogens — a randomized clinical trial [^114j81XK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common chlamydia-associated syndrome in men. However, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium are also associated with its etiology and should be considered in approaches to therapy. We sought to determine whether the addition of tinidazole, an anti-trichomonal agent, to the treatment regimen would result in higher cure rates than those achieved with treatment using doxycycline or azithromycin alone. A secondary aim was to compare the efficacy of doxycycline therapy with azithromycin therapy.

- **Methods**: Randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase IIB trial of men with NGU. Participants were randomized to receive doxycycline with or without tinidazole or azithromycin with or without tinidazole and were observed for up to 45 days.

- **Results**: The prevalences of Chlamydia trachomatis, M. genitalium, and T. vaginalis were 43%, 31%, and 13%, respectively. No pathogens were identified in 29% of participants. Clinical cure rates at the first follow-up visit were 74.5% (111 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 68.6% (107 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. By the final visit, cure rates were 49% (73 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 43.6% (68 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. There were no significant differences in clinical response rates among the treatment arms. However, the chlamydia clearance rate was 94.8% (55 of 58 patients) for the doxycycline arm and 77.4% (41 of 53 patients) for the azithromycin arm (P = .011), and the M. genitalium clearance rate was observed.

### Methods for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in the male partners of infected women: Implications for control of trichomoniasis [^116XyU9n]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection in men is an important cause of nongonococcal urethritis. Effective detection of the parasite in men using culture requires examination of multiple specimens. We compared culture and PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in urethral swabs, urine, and semen for T. vaginalis detection in male sexual partners of women with trichomoniasis identified by wet mount and culture. Trichomonads were detected by at least one positive test in 205/280 men (73.2%) who submitted at least one specimen for culture and PCR. Whereas InPouch TV culture detected only 46/205 cases (22.5%), PCR detected 201/205 (98.0%). Urethral swab cultures from men with urethritis were more likely to be positive with shorter incubation than specimens from men without urethritis. T. vaginalis was detected more often in men with wet-mount-positive partners. Even with a sensitive PCR assay, reliable detection of T. vaginalis in male partners required multiple specimens. The majority of male sexual partners in this study were infected, emphasizing the importance of partner evaluation and treatment.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^1155tXCH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Nitroimidazoles, specifically metronidazole and tinidazole, are the only recommended drugs for treating Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Previous assessments of resistance have been geographically limited. We evaluated the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among T. vaginalis isolates from various US locations. Swab specimens were collected from women undergoing routine pelvic examinations at sexually transmitted disease clinics in six US cities. Cultured T. vaginalis isolates were assessed for nitroimidazole resistance, defined as an aerobic minimum lethal concentration (MLC) greater than 50 µg/mL. Among 538 T. vaginalis isolates, 23 (4.3%) demonstrated low-level in vitro metronidazole resistance with MLCs ranging from 50–100 µg/mL. No isolates showed moderate-to-high-level resistance to metronidazole or resistance to tinidazole. These findings suggest that reliance on a single class of antimicrobial drugs for treating T. vaginalis infections may increase vulnerability to resistance emergence, indicating the need for novel treatment options.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^115rNFKj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to update information on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection in the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent findings indicate that the efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has recently been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500 mg twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential, since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected, and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is recommended given the high repeat infection rates.

Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, the best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy, and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

In summary, a 7-day course of 500 mg MTZ taken twice daily should be used as the first-line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

### Murine models of vaginal trichomonad infections [^113p3j5H]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus cause common sexually transmitted infections in humans and cattle, respectively. Mouse models of trichomoniasis are important for pathogenic and therapeutic studies. Here, we compared murine genital infections with T. vaginalis and T. foetus.

Persistent vaginal infection with T. foetus was established with 100 parasites, but T. vaginalis infection required doses of 10^6, perhaps due to greater susceptibility to killing by mouse vaginal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Infection with T. vaginalis persisted longest after combined treatment of mice with estrogen and dexamethasone. In contrast, infection was only short-lived when mice were given estrogen or dexamethasone alone, co-infected with Lactobacillus acidophilus, or pretreated with antibiotics.

Infection rates were similar with metronidazole-resistant (MR) and metronidazole-sensitive (MS) T. vaginalis. High-dose but not low-dose metronidazole treatment controlled infection with MS better than MR T. vaginalis. These murine models will be valuable for investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of trichomoniasis.

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic Trichomonas vaginalis infections [^1178xa4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of Black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals.

This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection.

Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

### Clinical validation of the Aptima bacterial vaginosis and Aptima vaginitis assays: Results from a prospective multicenter clinical study [^115Kmi98]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

In-clinic methods for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis present challenges that impact diagnostic accuracy and treatment. For BV, accurate diagnosis involves identifying the shift from a protective lactobacillus-dominated vaginal environment to pathogenic anaerobe bacterial growth. Microbes indicated as causative agents in BV, such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, and Prevotella, are present in women both with and without BV as currently defined, so mere detection does not provide adequate specificity.

The subjectivity of Nugent scoring of a Gram stain is evident due to the need for consensus scoring to improve accuracy, which is not practical in clinical practice. Microscopy also presents challenges in terms of training, expertise, and equipment, leading many clinicians to default to empirical diagnosis and treatment, resulting in incorrect management of infectious vaginitis.

Multiplexed amplified molecular methods offer a viable alternative, where multiple microbes can be accurately quantitated at very high numbers (10^6 CFU/ml or more), allowing the retraction of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella, Atopobium, and other microbes in BV to be objectively measured, analyzed, and assessed. For the diagnosis of candidiasis, culture is routinely performed, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive, often lacking the sensitivity and species-level identification of molecular methods. Accurate identification of azole-resistant species is also important in guiding appropriate treatment.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: Implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113uUFua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from three public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

- **Results**: We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners (95% confidence interval, 66.0%-77.3%), of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI.

### Metronidazole [^1127irLL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage and administration for trichomoniasis:

- **In the female**: One-day treatment involves administering two grams of metronidazole tablets, USP, either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given on the same day.

	- The seven-day course of treatment consists of 250 mg taken three times daily for seven consecutive days. Controlled comparative studies indicate that cure rates, as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher following a seven-day course of treatment than following a one-day treatment regimen.

	- The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can ensure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in patients who cannot be relied upon to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Furthermore, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses, and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

### Tindamax [^1143haob]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

- **Usage**:
	- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tindamax and other antibacterial drugs, Tindamax should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Tindamax is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for:

- **Trichomoniasis**
- **Giardiasis**: In patients age 3 and older
- **Amebiasis**: In patients age 3 and older
- **Bacterial vaginosis**: In non-pregnant, adult women

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tindamax and other antibacterial drugs, Tindamax should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115gKorY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis, but cure rates are suboptimal, and recurrence rates remain high.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the impact of a standard course of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice per day for 7 days) on the vaginal microbiota of Rwandan bacterial vaginosis patients using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate correlates of treatment failure.

- **Study design**: HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 18–45 years with bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (N = 68) were interviewed and sampled before and after metronidazole treatment. They were also screened, and treated if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7–10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N = 55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4–10.

- **Results**: The bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log 10 /μL (P < 0.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log 10 /μL (P < 0.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1122BST5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Women who seek care at sexual health clinics and primary care offices differ from many disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the emergency department (ED). Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although using a single-dose regimen minimizes concerns about collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC-endorsed empirical expedited partner therapy (EPT) treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia. In cases of sexual assault, compliance with follow-up visits is often poor.

For women with a clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) testing is unavailable, empirical treatment with a 2-gram single-dose tinidazole for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and a 150-mg single-dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision-making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment, leading to persistent symptoms, additional healthcare visits, and transmission risk. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC-recommended second-day 2-gram tinidazole dose or a 7-day 500-mg twice-daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV. Women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed additional fluconazole doses on Day 4 and Day 7.

### Trichomonas vaginalis, HIV, and African-Americans [^111XtMGp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis may be emerging as one of the most important cofactors in amplifying HIV transmission, particularly in African-American communities of the United States. In a person co-infected with HIV, the pathology induced by T. vaginalis infection can increase HIV shedding. Trichomonas infection may also act to expand the portal of entry for HIV in an HIV-negative person. Studies from Africa have suggested that T. vaginalis infection may increase the rate of HIV transmission by approximately twofold. Available data indicate that T. vaginalis is highly prevalent among African-Americans in major urban centers of the United States and is often the most common sexually transmitted infection in black women. Even if T. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by a small amount, this could translate into an important amplifying effect since Trichomonas is so common. Substantial HIV transmission may be attributable to T. vaginalis in African-American communities of the United States.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^111wKJp1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

As providers move toward multidose MTZ as the preferred regimen for all women with trichomoniasis, our findings also support the use of single-dose SEC. With efficacy rates for the treatment of trichomoniasis comparable to those of multidose MTZ, SEC has favorable attributes that may provide advantages over other options. In vitro studies of *T. vaginalis* isolates showed that the minimal lethal concentration of SEC is 56% lower compared with MTZ. SEC also differs from other 5-nitroimidazoles with a notably longer half-life (17 hours) vs. MTZ (7–8 hours) and TDZ (12 hours).

Single-dose options are convenient and likely to improve adherence overall, especially in populations at risk for noncompliance. Of note, compliance with multidose MTZ has been low (50%–63%) in some studies. Factors that may impact adherence include gastrointestinal complaints, treatment duration, and lifestyle restrictions. In one study, 23% of patients reported nausea in the single-dose and multidose MTZ groups. In our study, 2.7% of patients reported nausea with SEC. Additionally, SEC does not have an alcohol restriction based on data from in vitro studies.

### Trichomoniasis: Under control or undercontrolled [^11746SG2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Aside from human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, yet it has long been regarded as a sexually transmitted infection of minor importance. Medical opinion has traditionally held that it plays little role in health complications in women, and it is rarely seen in men. However, evidence has recently accumulated implicating *Trichomonas vaginalis* as a contributor to a variety of adverse outcomes among both sexes.

Among both women and men, the association of *T. vaginalis* with human immunodeficiency acquisition and transmission has been shown in multiple studies. Among women, trichomoniasis may play a role in the development of cervical neoplasia, postoperative infections, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and as a factor in atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Among men, trichomoniasis has emerged as a cause of nongonococcal urethritis and as contributing to male factor infertility. As evidence continues to accumulate, the time has come to increase diagnostic efforts beyond traditional sexually transmitted disease clinic settings.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by the lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted on all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts.

This article describes advances in TV diagnostics that have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of reTV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis in pregnancy: A systematic review [^115JC2T2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis during pregnancy decreases the risk of preterm birth and associated adverse outcomes.

Data sources included Pre-MEDLINE and MEDLINE (1966–2003), EMBASE (1980–2003), and the Cochrane Library. The search utilized the keywords "bacterial vaginosis", "Trichomonas", "Trichomonas vaginalis", "Trichomonas vaginitis", "Trichomonas infections", "pregnancy", "pregnant", "antibiotics", and "antibiotic prophylaxis".

- **Methods of study selection**: The search produced 1,888 titles, of which 1,256 abstracts were reviewed further. Out of these, 1,217 were deemed ineligible. Inclusion criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotics with no antibiotic or placebo in women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with symptomatic or asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis, intact membranes, and not in labor. Exclusion criteria included papers published in a language other than English, a dropout rate of more than 20% in either group, and lack of usable outcomes. Out of the 39 papers reviewed in detail, 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

- **Tabulation, integration, and results**: One author reviewed titles obtained from the searches, and two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts, excluded ineligible ones, identified eligible papers, and abstracted the data. For women with bacterial vaginosis, antibiotics reduced the risk of persistent infection but did not reduce the risk of preterm birth or the incidence of associated adverse outcomes.
