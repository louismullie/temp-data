## Question

What does it mean to have elevated factor VIII, elevated von willebrand antigen and factor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means to have elevated factor VIII, von Willebrand factor antigen, and factor IX, and what these results might indicate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what these proteins do in normal physiology and why they travel together. Then, I should verify the strength of association between elevated levels and venous thromboembolism risk. Next, I need to check transient versus persistent determinants of elevation to avoid misclassification. After that, I will review implications for bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease and risk of "masking". Then, I should confirm evidence-based testing protocols and thresholds. Finally, I will consider management implications, special populations, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with self-checks at each step.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. Factor VIII is a procoagulant cofactor stabilized in plasma by its carrier, von Willebrand factor, which prevents rapid clearance; the two circulate as a tightly associated complex, so changes in VWF often track with FVIII levels. Factor IX, once activated, forms the intrinsic "tenase" complex with FVIIIa to activate factor X, meaning elevations of FVIII and FIX could have additive effects on thrombin generation. I need to ensure I keep in mind that VWF is produced by endothelium and megakaryocytes and serves roles in platelet adhesion and FVIII carriage, so VWF elevations may also indicate endothelial activation or an acute-phase response.

> Now, I will examine the thrombotic risk signal. Elevated FVIII and VWF are among the strongest laboratory risk factors for first venous thromboembolism in case-control data; in the large MEGA study, FVIII and VWF above the 99th percentile each carried odds ratios around 23–24 compared with levels at or below the 25th percentile, and these associations persisted after adjusting for other procoagulant factors, indicating fairly independent effects. Hold on, I should verify generalizability: effect sizes are smaller in prospective cohorts, but the dose-response for FVIII is consistent, and FIX shows a weaker and possibly thresholded association. Importantly, combined elevations of FVIII and FIX above the 90th percentile can yield an approximately fivefold higher risk compared to neither elevated, which I should not overlook when all three analytes are high in the same patient [^114s3mNv] [^112MSSg4] [^114d118p].

> But wait, let me not jump to conclusions about effect size translation to practice. Cohort estimates are attenuated versus case-control, likely because single baseline measurements years before events do not capture time-varying exposure and because acute-phase elevations around events inflate case-control odds by reverse causation. Still, FVIII elevation is reproducibly linked to recurrent VTE and, in MEGA follow-up, to higher all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent manner, although non-O blood group–related lifelong FVIII elevation did not show a clear causal link to death, suggesting confounding by comorbidity and inflammation in the mortality signal. I should note that FIX associations often attenuate after adjusting for FVIII, so FIX may be contributory but less independently robust than FVIII and VWF [^116VEKZo] [^116VEKZo] [^115kQGbH].

> Next, I should review drivers of elevated levels and separate transient from persistent causes. Initially, I was going to say anemia lowers VWF and FVIII; wait, let me verify that. The recent data actually show an inverse correlation between hemoglobin and VWF/FVIII such that anemia is associated with higher VWF antigen, higher VWF activity, and higher FVIII activity; obesity and Black race are also independently associated with higher levels, so testing during anemia or in the context of higher BMI or certain ancestries can yield elevated results that may not reflect a fixed thrombophilia. I also need to check classic acute-phase drivers: inflammation, surgery, and pregnancy typically increase VWF and FVIII, sometimes two- to fourfold, which can mask underlying von Willebrand disease during stress states. For persistent genetic determinants, non-O ABO blood groups have higher average VWF and FVIII, a difference of roughly 25–30%, though in non-severe hemophilia A, the F8 genotype predominates and ABO/VWF have only minor effects on FVIII levels. The clinical implication is straightforward: a single high result in an acute or stressed setting does not establish a thrombophilia; I should repeat testing when the patient is clinically stable to confirm persistence before labeling it as a risk trait [^112KKfDe] [^112ETSpo] [^112T7Zfm] [^112MSSg4] [^116mW5Uu] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the bleeding-disorder angle, because elevations can mislead. Elevated VWF and FVIII during stress can normalize or elevate measurements in someone who actually has von Willebrand disease, creating a risk of false reassurance. Hold on, I should verify the guidance: if VWF levels "normalize with age" or are measured during intercurrent illness, guidelines recommend reassessing the bleeding phenotype and repeating testing when stable; platelet function testing may be warranted if not previously performed. Practically, that means I should not rule out VWD solely on a normal VWF/FVIII panel drawn during anemia, pregnancy, surgery, or active inflammation, and I should anchor my interpretation in the clinical bleeding history and timing of the draw [^111gu3U5] [^111QCV4K].

> Let me think about diagnostic thresholds and ratios to avoid misclassification. For type 1 VWD, a VWF level less than 0.30 IU/mL confirms the diagnosis even without bleeding, and less than 0.50 IU/mL supports the diagnosis in the setting of abnormal bleeding. For type 2 VWD, a platelet-dependent VWF activity to VWF antigen ratio less than 0.7 (or in some algorithms 0.6) is reasonably accurate to suggest a qualitative defect, although certainty varies; I should double-check that a low ratio is not simply due to assay variability. If I suspect increased VWF clearance (type 1C), a desmopressin trial with 1- and 4-hour post-infusion sampling can document rapid decay consistent with clearance defects, which helps reconcile normal or elevated stress-state VWF with a bleeding phenotype when stable [^112Ffgw7] [^113F1uRY] [^114vKsHB] [^1137qts5] [^116mna8z].

> Next, I should review when and how to measure these factors. I need to ensure testing is performed when the patient is well, off the immediate perioperative period, and not pregnant, to minimize acute-phase distortion. I should measure FVIII activity, VWF antigen, and a platelet-dependent VWF activity assay (ristocetin cofactor or GPIb-based) together, and document ABO blood group for context. If levels are high, I should repeat at least once, generally after three months, to confirm persistence; if VWD is suspected but levels are normal or high in a stress state, I should repeat when stable. Indications for testing are focused: unprovoked or recurrent VTE at a young age, or a strong family history; routine screening of the general population or before estrogen therapy is not recommended. I should also consider FIX measurement when assessing VTE risk profiling, recognizing its weaker and confounded association compared with FVIII. If the activity-to-antigen ratio is low or the phenotype suggests a qualitative VWF defect, additional studies such as collagen binding, multimer analysis, or targeted genetic testing may be appropriate in specialized settings [^116VEKZo] [^1133SRy8] [^114eSNnt] [^116VEKZo].

> Now, management implications. For patients with VTE and elevated FVIII/VWF/FIX, standard-intensity anticoagulation is used; duration is guided primarily by clinical recurrence risk rather than the mere presence of a thrombophilia, since testing rarely alters intensity or drug choice. Elevated FVIII/VWF may tip the balance toward extended therapy in selected patients when integrated with clinical factors, but I need to be careful not to overweigh a single high measurement obtained in an acute-phase context. In VWD perioperative care, I should target both FVIII and VWF activity to at least 0.50 IU/mL for three days or more after major surgery, while avoiding excessive FVIII peaks; where thrombotic risk is a concern, preferential use of FVIII-poor VWF concentrates can help achieve hemostasis while limiting supraphysiologic FVIII excursions, which have been linked to thrombosis in case reports and observational series. Let me confirm: several guidelines caution keeping FVIII below 150–250 IU/dL depending on region, which is more feasible with FVIII-poor products and careful monitoring in high-risk patients such as the elderly or those with obesity or major orthopedic procedures [^111qXEPP] [^117LGiij].

> I should also consider broader clinical implications beyond VTE. VWF antigen functions as a biomarker of endothelial activation and correlates with disease activity in ANCA-associated vasculitis, and higher VWF at intubation in acute lung injury associates with worse outcomes, supporting its role as a systemic stress marker rather than a thrombophilia alone. In patients with concurrent cancer and stroke, higher VWF antigen has correlated with more severe neurologic injury and inflammation, although causality is uncertain. Conversely, in a pediatric Thai cohort with cryptogenic arterial ischemic stroke, elevated FVIII and VWF were not independent risk factors, reminding me that adult VTE data cannot be extrapolated wholesale to pediatric arterial disease. I need to ensure I interpret elevated VWF/FVIII in the full clinical context rather than in isolation [^1178mn86] [^112KKfDe] [^113Pddqz] [^114bSN12].

> Special populations require nuance. During pregnancy, progressive physiologic increases in VWF and FVIII can obscure baseline deficiencies and delay the diagnosis of VWD; preconception or early pregnancy baselines are helpful for peripartum planning, and postpartum reassessment may be necessary. In non-severe hemophilia A, the underlying F8 variant dominates baseline FVIII levels, so ABO and VWF have only minor modifying effects; I should be cautious not to overinterpret VWF or ABO status in that subgroup when assessing FVIII levels or bleeding risk [^112T7Zfm] [^116mW5Uu].

> Let me synthesize a practical path with checkpoints. First, verify clinical context and timing: were samples obtained during anemia, intercurrent illness, surgery, pregnancy, or shortly after a thrombotic event; if yes, repeat when stable. Second, confirm persistence with at least one repeat measurement and interpret in light of ABO, BMI, and race, all of which can shift baseline upward. Third, integrate thrombotic risk: sustained high FVIII and VWF support higher VTE risk, while high FIX adds modestly, but decisions on anticoagulation duration should primarily reflect clinical recurrence risk. Fourth, do not let elevated stress-state VWF/FVIII obscure a bleeding phenotype; revisit VWD testing when stable, use appropriate thresholds and activity-to-antigen ratios, and consider a desmopressin clearance study if type 1C is suspected. Finally, in VWD perioperative management, target both FVIII and VWF to hemostatic ranges while avoiding FVIII overshoot, ideally with FVIII-poor VWF concentrates in high-risk scenarios. I should double-check that each step is supported by at least one stable-time measurement before making durable management decisions [^111gu3U5] [^116VEKZo] [^112DUYA3] [^112Ffgw7] [^111qXEPP] [^117LGiij].

Elevated factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen/activity indicate a **prothrombotic state** [^114s3mNv] and are most often due to **acute phase response** from inflammation, infection, pregnancy, or stress [^111gu3U5] [^112ETSpo] [^1178mn86]. They are strong, independent risk factors for **venous thromboembolism (VTE)**, with risk rising as levels increase. Persistent elevation warrants evaluation for chronic inflammation, malignancy, liver disease, or genetic predisposition, and management focuses on addressing underlying causes and considering thromboprophylaxis in high-risk settings [^112MSSg4] [^112DUYA3].

---

## Physiological roles of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor

**Factor VIII (FVIII)** is a coagulation cofactor in the intrinsic pathway and is stabilized in plasma by VWF, which prolongs its half-life and prevents degradation [^114RSfTg]. **Von Willebrand factor (VWF)** is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at injury sites and carries FVIII [^114RSfTg], protecting it from proteolysis [^112F3bbC].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated factor VIII and VWF levels

Elevated FVIII and VWF levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of **venous thromboembolism (VTE)**, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Several studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between elevated FVIII/VWF levels and thrombotic risk [^114s3mNv] [^114d118p]. Clinically, they are among the strongest independent risk factors for **venous thromboembolism (VTE)** — with risk increasing progressively as levels rise. They have also been implicated in **arterial thrombosis**, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors [^113Pddqz].

---

## Causes of elevated factor VIII and VWF levels

Elevated FVIII and VWF levels can result from **various physiological, pathological, and genetic factors**:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Physiological | - Pregnancy <br/> - Stress <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Aging [^112ETSpo] |
| Pathological | - Inflammation <br/> - Infection <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Anemia [^111gu3U5] [^112KKfDe] [^113Pddqz] |
| Genetic | - Non-O blood group <br/> - Genetic polymorphisms affecting FVIII or VWF synthesis or clearance [^112MSSg4] |

## Clinical implications and risks associated with elevated levels

Elevated FVIII and VWF levels significantly increase the risk of **thrombotic events**. The risk is particularly pronounced in individuals with persistent elevations, as opposed to transient increases due to acute phase reactions. **Persistent elevation** is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, malignancy, liver disease, and genetic predisposition; these individuals have a sustained increase in thrombotic risk and may require long-term management strategies [^112MSSg4]. In contrast, **transient elevation** typically occurs in response to acute inflammation, infection, or stress, and although the thrombotic risk is temporarily increased, it usually returns to baseline once the acute phase resolves [^1178mn86] [^112KKfDe].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When elevated FVIII and VWF levels are detected, a **comprehensive evaluation** is recommended to identify underlying causes and assess thrombotic risk:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed assessment of personal and family history of thrombotic events, bleeding disorders, and underlying medical conditions [^112DUYA3].

- **Laboratory tests**: Repeat measurements of FVIII and VWF levels after resolution of acute phase reactions, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), liver function tests, and genetic testing if indicated.

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound or CT angiography may be considered if thrombotic events are suspected.

---

## Management strategies

Management of elevated FVIII and VWF levels focuses on addressing underlying causes, **reducing thrombotic risk**, and monitoring for complications:

- **Address underlying causes**: Treating underlying inflammation, infection, or medical conditions can help normalize FVIII and VWF levels.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, regular exercise, and smoking cessation can reduce thrombotic risk [^1133SRy8].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Anticoagulant therapy may be considered in individuals with persistent elevations and high thrombotic risk, particularly if they have a history of thrombotic events [^115qc4J4].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up and monitoring of FVIII and VWF levels, particularly in individuals with persistent elevations or underlying chronic conditions.

---

Elevated factor VIII and von Willebrand antigen/activity reflect a **prothrombotic state** and are strong, independent risk factors for VTE. Persistent elevation warrants evaluation for chronic inflammation, malignancy, liver disease, or genetic predisposition, and management focuses on addressing underlying causes and considering thromboprophylaxis in high-risk settings.

### High levels of coagulation factors and venous thrombosis risk: Strongest association for factor VIII and von Willebrand factor [^114s3mNv]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Elevated procoagulant levels are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (VT). The dependency on increased factor levels and VT was analyzed in a large study. Factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) were associated with the highest VT risk. The risks for other procoagulant factor levels were largely explained by FVIII and VWF.

- **Background**: Coagulation factors are essential for robust clot formation. However, elevated levels of procoagulant factors are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (VT). The precise contribution of these factors to the development of VT is not yet understood.

- **Objectives**: We determined the thrombosis risk for the highest levels of eight selected coagulation factors. Furthermore, we analyzed which of these coagulation factors had the strongest impact on the supposed association.

- **Methods**: We used data from 2,377 patients with a first VT and 2,940 control subjects in whom fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF), factor II, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, and FXI levels were measured.

- **Results**: The odds ratios (ORs) for the various coagulation factor levels (> 99th percentile versus ≤ 25th percentile) varied between 1.8 and 4, except for FVIII (OR 23.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.7–36.0) and VWF (OR 24.0; 95% CI 15.3–37.3). Adjustment for FVIII and VWF in a mediation analysis reduced the risks of the other factors to unity, with the exception of FIX and FXI (remaining ORs between 1.7 and 1.9). Conversely, the ORs for FVIII and VWF levels remained high after adjustment for all other procoagulant factors.

### Hemoglobin concentration and body mass index are determinants of plasma von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels [^111gu3U5]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, characterized by an abnormal quantity or quality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Anemia is often found at presentation for a bleeding disorder evaluation due to chronic blood loss.

- **Objectives and hypothesis**: We hypothesized that anemia is associated with elevations in both VWF and factor VIII (FVIII) over baseline. We also hypothesized that obesity would be associated with increased levels of VWF.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center review of the electronic health record for patients that had proximal von Willebrand profiles and hemoglobin (Hb) data.

- **Results**: We identified 4552 unique subjects with VWF studies and a CBC within 24 hours. We found that decreasing hemoglobin inversely correlated with VWF antigen, VWF ristocetin cofactor activity, and FVIII activity. We also found that obesity and Black race were independently associated with increased VWF antigen, activity, and FVIII activity. Hb, race, and body mass index (BMI) continued to be determinants of VWF and FVIII levels in multivariable analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Our study demonstrates that anemia, race, and BMI were associated with elevation of VWF antigen, VWF activity, and FVIII levels. As many individuals with anemia present for evaluation for a bleeding disorder, these variables need to be considered.

- **Key points**
- Anemia was found to be associated with elevation of VWF antigen, VWF activity, and FVIII levels.
- Testing von Willebrand factor at times of anemia may mask a diagnosis of von Willebrand Disease.

### Plasma levels of coagulation factors VIII and IX and risk of venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114d118p]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Low credibility.

We conclude that the risk of VTE increases across population distributions of FVIII and FIX levels. Levels above the 90th percentile have almost twice the risk for FIX level compared to levels below; three-fold risk for FVIII level; and almost five-fold risk for both FVIII and FIX levels elevated. Further population studies are suggested to assess potential predictive value and causality.

### Von Willebrand factor antigen as a marker of disease activity in childhood-onset antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^1178mn86]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen plays a role in vascular inflammation and thrombosis, both of which are important in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Previous work found that VWF correlates with disease activity in childhood-onset primary CNS vasculitis. We sought to determine the relationship between VWF and disease activity over time in children with AAV.

- **Methods**: AAV patients with more than one VWF level measured were included in this retrospective study, and the relationships between active vasculitis, VWF, and other disease measures were analyzed. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to account for repeated VWF measurements within a patient. Repeated measures correlation was used to determine associations of paired laboratory observations. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating curve analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 732 VWF measurements were collected in 33 AAV patients. VWF antigen levels were higher during active disease [median 2.03 IU/ml, interquartile range (IQR) 1.35, 2.55] compared with inactive disease (median 1.18 IU/ml, IQR 0.94, 1.53). VWF antigen was the only variable that was significantly associated with active disease (odds ratio 3.01, P < 0.001, 95% CI 2.3, 3.93). The effect of VWF did not show a substantial difference between the disease subtypes. There was a moderate positive correlation between VWF antigen and disease activity, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity rates.

- **Conclusion**: Increased VWF antigen levels correlate with active vasculitis in this pediatric-onset population.

### Elevated factor VIII levels and risk of venous thrombosis [^115qc4J4]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Modern thrombophilia testing fails to identify any underlying prothrombotic tendency in a significant number of patients presenting with objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE). This observation has led to a search for other novel inherited or acquired human thrombophilias. Although a number of putative mechanisms have been described, the evidence behind many of these candidates remains weak.

In contrast, an increasing body of work supports the hypothesis that increased plasma factor VIII (FVIII) levels may be important in this context. An association between elevated plasma FVIII levels and VTE was first described in the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS). Subsequently, these conclusions have been supported by an increasing number of independent case-control studies, which have cumulatively demonstrated that high FVIII levels constitute a prevalent, dose-dependent risk factor for VTE. Furthermore, more recent studies have shown that the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis is also significantly increased in patients with high FVIII levels.

In this review, we present the evidence supporting the hypothesis that elevated FVIII levels constitute a clinically important thrombophilia. In addition, we examine the biological mechanisms that may underlie persistently elevated FVIII levels and the pathways through which high FVIII may serve to increase thrombotic risk.

### Thrombophilia testing: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^112DUYA3]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Although these effects are significant, their utility is limited. Clinical history, in conjunction with simple tests such as D-dimer in selected patients, can identify those whose risk of recurrence is high enough to warrant long-term anticoagulation and which is not lowered significantly by the absence of a thrombophilic trait. These factors also identify patients with low risk of recurrence not requiring long-term anticoagulation, even in the presence of heritable thrombophilic traits.

There is no evidence that the presence of heritable thrombophilia influences the intensity, choice, or monitoring of anticoagulant therapy when treating thrombosis, except potentially in those with AT deficiency. In AT deficiency, diagnosis makes specific treatment (antithrombin concentrate) available, which can be valuable and can also facilitate the interpretation of laboratory monitoring of heparin. Nonetheless, this is a rare disorder, and routine testing is not advised in the absence of a strong family history (defined as two or more first-degree relatives with VTE).

### Von Willebrand factor antigen levels predict poor outcomes in patients with stroke and cancer: findings from the multicenter, prospective, observational SCAN study [^113Pddqz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

A total of 90 patients were evaluated in this analysis. The median age was 75.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 70–82) and 33 (37%) were women. Patients were divided into two groups according to their median vWF antigen levels: the low-vWF group (61%–244%, n = 44) and the high-vWF group (246%–555%, n = 46).

- **Figure description**:
	- **Figure 1**: Shows the distribution of vWF antigen levels and correlation between vWF antigen levels and NIHSS score, D-dimer levels, and hs-CRP levels.
		- A, The 50%–155% range is considered to be the normal value of vWF antigen levels, which are shown as dotted lines. The red-colored line and bars represent the median (246) and IQR (180.3–310.3).
		- B, The NIHSS score at admission.
		- C, D-dimer levels (μg/mL).
		- D, hs-CRP levels (mg/dL). Blood samples were obtained immediately after patient admission and before any treatment was initiated. The Spearman rank correlation test was used in B, C, and D. hs-CRP indicates high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; IQR, interquartile range; NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; and vWF, von Willebrand factor.

The baseline patient characteristics are summarized below. There were no significant differences in the background, past medical history, cancer status, or cancer sites between the two groups. More than half of the patients in each group had advanced cancer. The patients in the low-vWF group had significantly higher rates of cancer surgery before the onset of stroke than those in the high-vWF group.

### Plasma levels of coagulation factors VIII and IX and risk of venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VEKZo]. Thrombosis Research (2023). High credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed both dose-response (per quarter and per one SD increase) and threshold analyses of levels above the 90th percentile. We report that VTE risk increases with higher levels of both FVIII and FIX, with a stronger and more consistent association for FVIII. While there was good evidence of linearity for FVIII, the patterns of odds ratios by quarters of FIX suggest a non-linear threshold effect. These results are consistent with the findings of the largest study, MEGA, which showed that FVIII exhibits a stronger association with VTE risk than FIX, and that for each factor, the relative risk increases to a maximum at the highest percentile cut-off levels. There does not appear to be a threshold of factor levels at which risk estimates do not further increase.

We included studies from several European countries, North America, and India, covering the whole adult age range of 17–100 years in both men and women. Data were adjusted for age, sex, and obesity, and ethnicity where applicable, which are possible confounders. Further cohort studies would be useful to compare with case-control studies, which are the majority of published studies at the time of writing and showed higher odds ratios for FVIII and VTE risk compared to the hazard ratios in cohort studies in the present analysis.

Possible reasons for the lower odds ratios in cohort studies, which measured FVIII years before most VTE episodes occurred, include the assumption that baseline levels of hemostatic factors remain constant over time.

### Catabolism of the coagulation factor VIII: Can we prolong lifetime of f VIII in circulation [^112F3bbC]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The coagulation factor VIII is required for normal haemostasis because a deficiency or genetic defect in this molecule causes a life-threatening coagulation disorder known as hemophilia A. While the role of factor VIII in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation has been extensively studied, the mechanisms responsible for factor VIII turnover in circulation had not been characterized until recently. This review focuses on the finding that factor VIII catabolism, both in vitro and in vivo, is mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which acts as a hepatic clearance receptor. Factor VIII interaction with LRP involves two distinct sites localized within the C2 and A2 domains.

We discuss the contribution of the A2 site (residues 484–509) and the C2 site in factor VIII catabolism in the presence and absence of von Willebrand factor (vWf). Evidence is presented that LRP-mediated factor VIII catabolism is facilitated by cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which bind to the A2 residues 558–565 of factor VIII.

Since both LRP- and HSPG-binding sites within the A2 domain are potentially exposed in the circulating factor VIII/vWf complex, we discuss the possibility of prolonging the factor VIII lifetime in circulation by disrupting these sites using site-directed mutagenesis. The generation of a novel recombinant factor VIII could be prospective for more efficient hemophilia A therapy.

### Reassessment of von Willebrand factor (VWF), VWF propeptide, factor VIII:C and plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 during normal pregnancy [^112ETSpo]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

Use of von Willebrand factor [VWF antigen (WF:Ag)] measurement as a marker of endothelial cell activation for monitoring hypertensive pregnancies is limited by the poor definition of reference values. We reassessed these reference values using different assays, and those of the propeptide (VWF:Ag II) and factor VIII coagulant activity (factor VIII:C), in a large population of normal pregnancies at 3-week intervals of gestational age. Plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) were measured in parallel. Blood was collected at single time points between 12 weeks and delivery in 306 women undergoing normal singleton pregnancy.

For clinical purposes, the VWF:Ag reference values were assay independent, and the influence of ABO blood group on VWF:Ag or factor VIII:C was found to be limited during the third trimester. VWF:Ag II was not influenced by the ABO blood group. The ratio, VWF:Ag/factor VIII:C, was close to 1.0 throughout pregnancy. In contrast, VWF:Ag II increased more slowly than VWF:Ag, and the ratio of VWF:Ag II to VWF:Ag in plasma decreased from 1.00 to 0.5 at term. PAI-1 and PAI-2 increased with gestational age, but PAI-2 decreased during the last 2 weeks, indicating physiological placental regression at the very end of pregnancy.

### Von Willebrand factor antigen is an independent marker of poor outcome in patients with early acute lung injury [^112KKfDe]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the degree of systemic endothelial activation, as measured by the release of von Willebrand factor antigen into the circulation and pulmonary edema fluid, is an important determinant of outcome from acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Design**: Observational study.

- **Setting**: Intensive care unit patients in a tertiary university hospital and a university-affiliated city hospital.

- **Patients**: Fifty-one intubated, mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome as defined by the North American European Consensus Conference definitions.

- **Interventions**: Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and plasma were collected within 1 hour of endotracheal intubation in all patients.

- **Measurements**: Von Willebrand factor antigen concentrations and protein concentration were measured in pulmonary edema fluid and in plasma.

- **Main results**: At the time of intubation, median plasma von Willebrand factor antigen was 251%, two-fold higher than the median pulmonary edema fluid von Willebrand factor antigen of 130%. Median edema fluid and plasma von Willebrand factor antigen concentrations were significantly higher in patients who did not survive hospitalization. Plasma von Willebrand factor antigen was also higher in those patients who had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (as measured by ventilator-free days). Plasma von Willebrand factor antigen was also significantly higher in patients with sepsis and two or more organ system fail.

### Elevated levels of factor VIII and subsequent risk of all-cause mortality: Results from the MEGA follow-up study [^112MSSg4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). High credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) levels are increased in individuals with a non-O blood group and play a role in the etiology of thrombosis. High FVIII levels have also been associated with increased all-cause mortality.

- **Objective**: We explored whether elevated FVIII levels are associated with an increased risk of death in patients who had venous thrombosis and in individuals from the general population, and to what extent this association is causal.

- **Methods**: We followed 2,178 patients with previous venous thrombosis and 2,827 age and sex-matched community controls for an average of 5.5 years and measured their FVIII levels and ABO blood group.

- **Results**: All-cause mortality increased in a dose-response fashion with increasing percentiles of FVIII levels. In the thrombosis patients, the risk was highest above the 97.5th percentile (FVIII > 199 IU dL⁻¹) with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.9–10.8) compared with patients in the 25th percentile category (FVIII ≤ 85 IU dL⁻¹). The adjusted HR was 4.5 (95% CI, 1.4–14.3) in controls. Using non-O blood group as a measure of genetically elevated FVIII levels to determine a causal relationship between FVIII and death showed observed HRs of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.72–1.36) in patients and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.82–1.90) in controls.

- **Conclusions**: We showed a dose-response relationship between high FVIII levels and the risk of death in venous thrombosis patients and in individuals from the general population. However, environmental factors, such as chronic comorbidities and chronic inflammation, are at least in part responsible for these associations.

### The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex: Basic and clinical issues [^114RSfTg]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) are two distinct but related glycoproteins that circulate in plasma as a tightly bound complex (FVIII/VWF). Their deficiencies or structural defects are responsible for the most common inherited bleeding disorders, namely hemophilia A (HA) and von Willebrand's disease (VWD).

VWF has a dual role in hemostasis: it promotes platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces, as well as platelet-to-platelet cohesion during thrombus formation. Additionally, it serves as the carrier for FVIII in plasma. FVIII acts as a co-factor to accelerate the activation of factor X by activated factor IX in the coagulation cascade.

After many years of investigations, the molecular mechanisms of FVIII/VWF interactions are now well known. Recent biochemical studies have confirmed that VWF is a key partner for FVIII, playing significant roles in FVIII's function, production, stabilization, conformation, and immunogenicity. Both FVIII and VWF are present in most plasma-derived FVIII/VWF concentrates used in clinical practice.

FVIII/VWF concentrates can be classified into three main categories based on their degree of purification. Intermediate-high purity plasma-derived concentrates containing FVIII/VWF have been in use since 1987 and carry a low risk of transmitting blood-borne infections. The safety of these concentrates depends on two factors: the decrease of viral plasma load and the increase of viral inactivation. These FVIII/VWF concentrates are currently used in treating type 3 VWD and in type 1 or 2 VWD patients.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vKsHB]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is associated with significant morbidity due to excessive mucocutaneous bleeding. Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent and manage these symptoms. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of diagnostic tests using different cutoff values of von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and platelet-dependent von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity assays in diagnosing VWD.

We conducted searches in the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for eligible studies. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were pooled, and patient-important outcomes were reported when relevant. This review included 21 studies evaluating VWD diagnosis. The evidence demonstrated low certainty regarding a net health benefit from reconsidering the diagnosis of VWD versus removing the disease diagnosis in patients with VWF levels that have normalized with age.

For type 1 VWD diagnosis, VWF sequence variants were detected in 75% to 82% of patients with VWF:Ag < 0.30 IU/mL and in 44% to 60% of patients with VWF:Ag between 0.30 and 0.50 IU/mL. A sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76–0.97) were observed for a platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.7 in detecting type 2 VWD. These results exhibit moderate certainty in test accuracy.

Both VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent activity are continuous variables linked to an increased bleeding risk with decreasing levels. This systematic review demonstrates that using a VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.7 versus a lower cutoff can be indicative of the disease.

### Relationship between factor VIII activity, bleeds and individual characteristics in severe hemophilia A patients [^112RJx83]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The effect sizes of the most relevant parameter-covariate interactions are shown in Figure 3. The number of bleeds in the 12-month pre-study period correlating with the bleeding hazard was the most relevant interaction found. Compared to a mean patient with 8.2 bleeds in the pre-study period, a patient who had one bleed (5th percentile of the observed data) or 84 bleeds (95th percentile) pre-study was found to have a 54% lower (95% CI: 40–65) or 147% higher (95% CI: 79–226) hazard, respectively. These values translate into a bleeding hazard (λ 0.5 IU/dL) of 1.30 year⁻¹ (95% CI: 0.99–1.68) (1 pre-study bleed) and 6.97 year⁻¹ (95% CI: 5.05–9.18) (84 pre-study bleeds).

Von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels and race were found to correlate with CL. A patient with a vWF level of 64% (5th percentile) or 179% (95th percentile) had an estimated CL of 2.30 dL/h (95% CI: 2.17–2.45; terminal half-life 11.6 h) and 1.59 dL/h (95% CI: 1.47–1.69; terminal half-life 16.5 h), respectively. Patients of Black race had an estimated CL of 1.41 dL/h (95% CI: 1.16–1.71), Asian 2.21 dL/h (95% CI: 1.97–2.48), and Caucasian 1.93 dL/h (95% CI: 1.80–2.07).

A modest correlation was identified between vWF and bleeding severity. A patient with a vWF level of 64% had a probability of having a moderate or severe bleed of 57% (95% CI: 55–59), while the corresponding probability for a patient with a vWF level of 179% was 68% (95% CI: 62–75); a similar trend was found for age.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of hemophilia severity: What to do [^116E7vmw]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Measurements of factor VIII coagulation activity (FVIII:C) may vary and result in misclassification of hemophilia A, causing delays in the initiation of prophylactic treatment. We describe two young brothers who were diagnosed as moderate hemophilia patients and therefore not prophylactically treated with factor VIII concentrate despite frequent bleeding events. These findings emphasize the importance of the following:

- **Multiple measurements of FVIII:C**: Conduct these in certified laboratories.
- **Adjustment of treatment**: Modify treatment when test results do not correspond to clinical symptoms.
- **Relevance of additional DNA mutation analysis**: Conduct this analysis in patients with hemophilia A.
- **Treatment in centers with expertise**: Ensure patients receive care in specialized treatment centers.

### Plasma levels of coagulation factors VIII and IX and risk of venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Dqaqh]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Low credibility.

The results of our meta-analysis suggest that individuals with levels of FVIII or FIX above the 90th percentile thresholds have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): approximately twofold for FIX, threefold for FVIII, and fivefold for both high FVIII and FIX together. While potentially useful for enhancing VTE risk scores, an important practical issue is the need for specific age, sex, ethnicity, hormone use, and obesity reference ranges for FVIII and FIX levels. Ideally, these should be calculated from local population samples, as mean levels vary internationally.

Mass population screening via activity assays would be expensive and, like other thrombophilias, potentially futile. The most promising indication for testing FVIII and FIX levels may be in predicting recurrent VTE (reVTE). Our literature search identified six cohort studies on FVIII related to reVTE, which merit further studies and a future meta-analysis. FVIII has already been incorporated into two risk scores for reVTE development.

The genetic basis for increased FVIII and FIX levels is largely unknown, apart from influences such as the ABO blood group. There are only a few cases where well-defined gene lesions have been associated with increased levels. Further studies are necessary to establish the extent to which these associations are due to genetic factors.

Strengths of our study include the identification of an adequate number of studies that met our predefined criteria (5327 VTE cases with FVIII levels and 3498 cases with FIX levels) and additional analyses of seven of our own studies to enhance our statistical analysis.

### Von Willebrand disease: Clinical and laboratory lessons learned from the large von Willebrand disease studies [^115zXAL2]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

During the past 25 years, our knowledge concerning the pathogenesis, diagnostic strategies, and treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) has increased significantly. Following the immunological differentiation of factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the 1970s and the cloning of the FVIII and VWF genes in the mid-1980s, substantial progress has been made in our understanding of this most common inherited bleeding disorder.

We now recognize that VWD represents a range of genetic diseases, all with the clinical endpoint of increased mucocutaneous bleeding. The molecular pathology of Type 2 and Type 3 VWD is now comprehensively documented and involves rare sequence variants at the VWF locus. In contrast, the genetic causation of Type 1 disease remains incompletely defined and, in many cases, appears to involve genetic determinants in addition to or instead of VWF.

- **Diagnostic strategies**: The diagnostic triad of a personal history of excessive mucocutaneous bleeding, laboratory tests for VWF consistent with VWD, and a family history of the condition remain the keystone to VWD identification. In the laboratory, measurement of VWF antigen and function continue to be the most important diagnostic studies. While our understanding of the molecular genetic pathology of VWD has advanced considerably in the past decade, genetic testing as a component of diagnosis is limited to certain distinct subtypes of the disorder.

- **Treatment**: Treatment of VWD has been relatively unchanged for the past decade and continues to involve either stimulation of the release of intrinsic VWF with desmopressin or other therapeutic approaches.

This comprehensive understanding of VWD has advanced our approach to diagnosis and treatment, although areas such as Type 1 VWD still require further research for a more complete understanding.

### Criteria for low von Willebrand factor diagnosis and risk score to predict future bleeding [^114Qnofw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

- **Hemostatic laboratory measurements and risk of bleeding requiring treatment**: Of all hemostatic laboratory measurements, we found that a higher VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratio (continuous variable) was associated with a lower risk of bleeding requiring treatment during follow-up: HR = 0.27 (95% CI, 0.10–0.76; p = .013; see Table S1). There was also a clear difference in the risk of bleeding requiring treatment between patients with VWB:CB/VWF:Ag in the first quartile compared to those in the fourth quartile (p = .039).

- **Independent risk factors for bleeding requiring treatment**: To identify independent risk factors for bleeding requiring treatment in individuals with low VWF, we performed a Cox regression analysis with the forward (Wald) method. We included blood group, age at diagnosis, bleeding score at diagnosis, and reason for referral as independent variables. We found that referral for a personal bleeding diathesis, younger age at diagnosis, and an abnormal bleeding score at diagnosis were strong independent risk factors for bleeding requiring treatment during follow-up, respectively: HR = 2.32 (95% CI, 1.16–4.63; p = .017), HR = 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01–1.38; p = .036), and HR = 1.77 (95% CI, 1.04–3.01; p = .036).

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137qts5]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Use of platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio to confirm type 2 VWD has been investigated in several studies. Of the included studies, six reported on the VWF levels in type 2 VWD. The general characteristics of these studies, as well as the index and reference standards, are detailed. The full risk of bias assessment for individual studies is available in Supplement 4.

The certainty of the evidence for test accuracy is very low, primarily due to the case-control design contributing to significant population-selection bias. The studies do not directly compare the two test cutoffs, and there is notable unexplained inconsistency.

- **Study characteristics for diagnosing type 2 VWD using VWF:RCo/antigen ratio**:
	- The test accuracy of a platelet-dependent VWF activity assay/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.7 to confirm type 2 VWD was pooled from five cohort studies including 204 participants. These studies utilized laboratory testing methods such as a platelet function analyzer (PFA), ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA), VWF:Ag, FVIII activity, VWF collagen binding, and molecular diagnosis through DNA sequencing as reference standards for confirming type 2 VWD. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.98) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.63–0.99), respectively. There is moderate certainty in the sensitivity results and very low certainty in the specificity results.

- **Forest plots**:
	- Figure 2 shows forest plots displaying both the sensitivity and specificity from individual studies and the pooled estimates for a ratio < 0.7.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VEsYs]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

Independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, along with full-text review, in duplicate to identify eligible studies. Two reviewers independently completed data extraction in duplicate, with data verification by a third reviewer (M. A.K.). Disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach consensus in consultation with two expert clinician scientists (N.T.C. and P.D.J.). Data extraction included general study characteristics, diagnostic index test and reference standard, prevalence of von Willebrand disease (VWD), and parameters to determine test accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity.

- **Risk of bias and certainty of evidence**: We conducted the risk of bias assessment for diagnostic test accuracy studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 revised tool. Overall certainty was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, evaluating the evidence for each outcome on domains including risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.

- **Data synthesis**: When feasible, we combined the accuracy estimates from individual studies quantitatively, using Open Meta-Analyst to pool each test. A bivariate analysis was conducted for pooling sensitivity and specificity for each test comparison, accounting for variation within and between studies. Forest plots were developed for each comparison. The Breslow-Day test measured the percentage of total variation across studies.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Von Willebrand disease [^112c6Dnf]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, yet diagnosis and management remain challenging. The development and use of bleeding assessment tools allow for improved stratification of which patients may require further assessment and which patients are most likely to require treatment for their VWD. New options for laboratory assessment of von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity include a new platelet-binding assay, the VWF:GPIbM, which is subject to less variability than the ristocetin cofactor activity assay. Collagen-binding assays provide insight into a different function of VWF. Genetic testing may be helpful in some cases where a type 2 VWD variant is suspected but is usually not helpful in type 1 VWD. Finally, treatment options for VWD are reviewed, including the use of recombinant VWF. Despite these advances, further work is required to improve diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life for affected patients.

### Acquired von Willebrand syndrome and factor VIII in patients with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation undergoing transcatheter mitral valve repair [^112opjea]. Clinical cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory analysis**: Von Willebrand factor activity, von Willebrand factor antigen, and factor VIII were measured at baseline and after four weeks; results were available at both time points for 85 patients. Von Willebrand factor activity was analyzed using the INNOVANCE® VWF Ac system provided by SIEMENS (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen/Germany), and von Willebrand factor antigen was measured by immunoturbidimetry using devices from Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics or SYSMEX (SYSMEX CORPORATION). Factor VIII results were obtained through in-vitro diagnostics of coagulation factor VIII deficient plasma by SIEMENS.

- **Clinical follow-up**: Clinical assessment, including bleeding history, standardized echocardiographic parameters, and serial blood and urine sampling, was performed 24 hours before and four weeks after percutaneous mitral valve repair. Additionally, six-minute walk tests and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire were conducted to evaluate patients' physical and mental status. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was conducted using the iE-33 ultrasound system with an S5–1 transducer or the EPIQ CVx ultrasound system with an X5–1 transducer (Philips Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The quantification of mitral regurgitation adhered to the Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair Study (EVEREST) criteria.

- **Statistical analysis**: Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Version 25 (International Business Machines Corporation).

### Developments in the diagnostic procedures for von Willebrand disease [^112McADS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, but its diagnosis can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. VWD is mainly associated with mild mucocutaneous bleeding, although there are more severe phenotypes with bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or even the joints. Surgical interventions and trauma may also lead to critical bleeding events. These episodes are related to quantitative or qualitative defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric glycoprotein produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, which mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation and binds factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation.

This review describes the diagnostic procedures required for correct diagnosis, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis and classification for proper treatment and counseling. Assessment of bleeding starts with the medical history. After a positive bleeding or family history, subsequent laboratory investigations begin with a panel of standard screening tests for hemostatic defects. Patients suspected of having VWD will be tested for plasma VWF antigen levels, the ability of VWF to bind platelets, and FVIII activity. When VWD is confirmed, a set of subtyping tests can classify patients as VWD types 1, 2 (A, B, M, or N), or 3. The performance of additional assays and analyses, such as VWF propeptide measurement or genetic analysis, may help identify the pathological mechanism behind certain defects or guide the choice of treatment.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113GFkrM]. Blood advances (2022). Low credibility.

We summarized the test accuracy using a platelet-dependent VWF activity assay/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.6 to confirm type 2 VWD from three cohort studies that included 184 participants. Studies used laboratory testing, including PFA, RIPA, VWF:Ag, FVIII:C, VWF:CB, and molecular diagnosis through DNA sequencing as a reference standard for confirming type 2 VWD, with some studies also including a clinical historic diagnosis. The ranges for estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 0.68 to 0.97 and 0.87 to 0.88, respectively, indicating very low certainty in the sensitivity results and low certainty in the specificity results. Figure 3 shows the forest plot displaying the sensitivity and specificity from individual studies.

### Von Willebrand factor propeptide and the phenotypic classification of von Willebrand disease [^1125wV9s]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

The ratios between von Willebrand factor propeptide (VWFpp) or factor VIII activity (FviiiC) and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) reflect synthesis, secretion, and clearance of VWF. We aimed to define the pathophysiology of 658 patients with type 1, 2, or 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) with VWF levels ≤ 30 U/dL from the Willebrand in The Netherlands (WiN) study using the VWFpp/VWF:Ag and FviiiC/VWF:Ag ratios. We evaluated the use of VWFpp in the classification and diagnosis of VWD.

On the basis of the ratios, reduced VWF synthesis was observed in 18% of type 1 and only 2% of type 2 patients. A significant proportion of type 3 patients had detectable VWFpp (41%). These patients had a lower bleeding score than type 3 patients who had a complete absence of VWF:Ag and VWFpp (14.0 vs 19.5; p = 0.025). The majority of these patients had missense mutations with rapid VWF clearance, whereas type 3 patients with no VWFpp were homozygous for null alleles.

In conclusion, VWFpp identified severe type 1 VWD with very low VWF levels in patients who had previously been classified as type 3 VWD. This study underlines the clinical significance of the VWFpp assay in the diagnosis and classification of VWD.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TX81q]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is associated with significant morbidity due to excessive mucocutaneous bleeding. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent and manage these symptoms. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of diagnostic tests using different cutoff values of von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and platelet-dependent von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity assays in diagnosing VWD. We searched the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for eligible studies.

We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and reported patient-important outcomes when relevant. This review included 21 studies evaluating VWD diagnosis. The results demonstrated low certainty in the evidence concerning a net health benefit when reconsidering the diagnosis of VWD versus removing the disease diagnosis in patients whose VWF levels have normalized with age.

For the diagnosis of type 1 VWD, VWF sequence variants were detected in 75% to 82% of patients with VWF:Ag < 0.30 IU/mL and in 44% to 60% of patients with VWF:Ag between 0.30 and 0.50 IU/mL. A sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76–0.97) were observed for a platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.7 in detecting type 2 VWD (moderate certainty in the test accuracy results).

VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent activity are continuous variables associated with an increased bleeding risk as levels decrease. This systematic review shows the utility of using a VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio < 0.7 versus lower cutoff levels in diagnosis.

### The von Willebrand factor A-1 domain binding aptamer BT200 elevates plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII: a first-in-human trial [^112jB3QJ]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

The plasma concentration versus time profiles of the anti-von Willebrand factor aptamer, BT200, were studied in healthy volunteers. The mean (with standard error) plasma levels of BT200 were observed over time after: (A) single subcutaneous injections or infusions (n = 6); (B) single subcutaneous injections or infusions (n = 6); and (C) the last of five subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers in part B of the study (n = 6). SE denotes standard error, SC stands for subcutaneous, IV indicates intravenous, and D28 refers to day 28.

The effect of BT200 on VWF:RCo (von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor activity) appeared to be less pronounced compared to its effect on free VWF A1-domains. For example, a 36 mg dose reduced median VWF:RCo from 108% to 30%, while median free VWF A1-domains decreased from 84% to 6% after 48 hours (both P < 0.001; Friedman ANOVA). This apparent discrepancy can be attributed to the 2-fold increase in circulating VWF antigen levels after 48 hours. Because VWF:RCo is sensitive to changes in VWF levels, the effects of BT200 were less pronounced in VWF:RCo compared to free VWF A1-domains. Circulating VWF antigen mass increased as early as 24 hours after the start of the IV infusion and reached levels 4-fold higher than baseline between 7–14 days after SC doses of 24–48 mg (P < 0.001). VWF antigen levels increased 4-fold following multiple SC maintenance doses of 12 mg BT200 (P < 0.001).

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^117LGiij]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Prolonged treatment may be needed in major bleeding risk situations. More than 10 EDs were required in 37% of the major bleed cases and major surgeries in this study. Importantly, even in such circumstances, there were no thrombotic events, including in patients at higher risk: elderly (n = 14), overweight and obese individuals with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m² (n = 50), childbirths (n = 19), orthopedic surgeries (n = 12), or patients with multiple risk factors. Thromboembolic disease is multifactorial, but elevated FVIII levels > 150 IU/dL are considered an additional risk factor that should be avoided.

The infusion of factor VIII alongside endogenous FVIII production may lead to supraphysiological FVIII levels, increasing thrombotic risk. Literature reports a few cases of pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, and superficial thrombophlebitis in postoperative VWD patients receiving dual VWF/FVIII concentrates. More recently, a deep vein thrombosis was reported in a patient treated with rVWF during major surgery. Therefore, several therapeutic guidelines recommend maintaining FVIII below 150 IU/dL (Italian guideline, European guideline) or 250 IU/dL (U.S. guideline).

This objective is easier to achieve with an FVIII-poor VWF concentrate, which has the potential to raise VWF:RCo to high levels without causing unwanted high FVIII levels as recently emphasized.

There is no clear evidence regarding which cut‐off value (0.50 vs. 0.60 IU/ml) should be used to diagnose "low VWF". We performed a cohort study with a mean follow‐up of 6.3 ± 3.7 years in patients with historically lowest VWF levels of 0.31–0.60 IU/ml. No difference was found in the bleeding phenotype of patients with historically lowest VWF levels of 0.31–0.50 and 0.51–0.60 IU/ml. A risk score was developed to identify individuals with a high, intermediate, and low risk for bleeding following a low VWF diagnosis.

Genetic testing may be helpful in cases where a type 2 VWD variant is suspected, but it is usually not helpful in type 1 VWD. Finally, treatment options for VWD are reviewed, including the use of recombinant VWF. Despite these advances, more work is required to improve diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life for affected patients.

### Criteria for low von Willebrand factor diagnosis and risk score to predict future bleeding [^117LYXaJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

We combined the risk factors described previously to develop a risk score to identify low VWF patients with an increased risk for bleeding requiring treatment after diagnosis. Individuals with a total risk score of 0 or 1 are classified as low risk, those with a total score of 2 are classified as intermediate risk, and those with a total risk score of 3 to 5 are classified as high risk. The risk score performed excellently in distinguishing the risk for bleeding requiring treatment between low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients with low VWF (p < .001, Figure 4).

The number of patients with bleeding requiring treatment was 8/126 (6.3%) in individuals with low risk, 18/143 (12.6%) in intermediate-risk, and 39/170 (22.9%) in high-risk patients (p < .001, Figure 4A). Likewise, the incidence of bleeding requiring treatment per patient per decade was 0.22 ± 1.08 in low-risk, 0.28 ± 1.25 in intermediate-risk, and 0.87 ± 2.61 in high-risk individuals (p = .004, Figure 4B).

### Pregnancy and delivery in women with von Willebrand's disease and different von Willebrand factor mutations [^112T7Zfm]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy in von Willebrand's disease may carry a significant risk of bleeding. Information on changes in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor and pregnancy outcomes in relation to von Willebrand factor gene mutations is very scant.

- **Design and methods**: We examined biological response to desmopressin, changes in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, and pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of 23 women with von Willebrand's disease characterized at the molecular level and prospectively followed during 2000–2007.

- **Results**: Thirty-one pregnancies occurred during the study period. Remarkably, similar changes in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor were observed after desmopressin and during pregnancy in nine women with R854Q, R1374H, V1665E, V1822G, and C2362F mutations. Women with von Willebrand's disease and R1205H and C1130F mutations (17 pregnancies in 12 women) had only a slight increase in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor during pregnancy, while their response to desmopressin was marked but short-lived. For these women, two to three desmopressin administrations within the first 48 hours were sufficient to successfully manage vaginal delivery. Two women with recessive von Willebrand's disease due to compound heterozygosity for different gene mutations had a spontaneous, major increase in factor VIII while von Willebrand factor remained severely reduced. Desmopressin increased factor VIII and was clinically useful in the first case, while a factor VIII/von Willebrand factor concentrate was required in the second patient not responsive to the compound.

### Higher and lower active circulating VWF levels: Different facets of von Willebrand disease [^114fdeZA]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Most circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) is normally inactive and incapable of binding platelets, but numerous disorders may modify the proportion of active VWF. We explored active VWF levels in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) whose VWF had a higher affinity for platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib but different susceptibilities to ADAMTS13 and multimer patterns. This study included 9 patients lacking large multimers, 10 with a normal pattern, and 12 patients with VWF C2362F and R1819_C1948delinsS mutations, which make VWF resistant to ADAMTS13. Type 2B patients with abnormal or normal multimers had significantly more active VWF (3.33 ± 1.6 and 3.74 ± 0.74, respectively) compared to the normal level (0.99 ± 0.23). The type of VWF mutation influenced VWF activation: V1316M was associated with the highest levels in patients with abnormal multimers and R1341W in those with normal multimers. Pregnancy induced gradually rising active VWF levels and declining platelet counts in one type 2B VWD patient without large multimers. Active VWF levels dropped significantly in patients homozygous for the C2362F mutation or heterozygous for R1819_C1948delinsS mutations (0.2 ± 0.03 and 0.23 ± 0.1, respectively), and less in cases heterozygous for the VWF C2362F mutation (0.55 ± 0.17). We demonstrate that VWF may be more or less activated, with or without any direct involvement of the A1 domain, and regardless of ADAMTS13.

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^115BG9bs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric glycoprotein with a high molecular weight. VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis, promoting the adhesion of platelets to subendothelium after vascular injury and in blood coagulation as it carries and protects factor VIII (FVIII) from inactivation and rapid catabolism. VWD is a heterogeneous disease ranging from moderate to very severe deficiency in VWF and is classified into three different types: Type 1 and Type 3 are characterized by a partial or (virtually) complete quantitative deficiency of VWF, while Type 2 results from qualitative defects. The prevalence of VWD in patients referred for clinically relevant bleeding symptoms is about 0.01%, although the most severe form, Type 3 VWD, is very rare (0.5‐5 cases/million).

The goal of VWD therapy is the correction of the VWF defect and, consequently, the correction of abnormal platelet adhesion and the abnormal intrinsic coagulation pathway. Several plasma‐derived VWF/FVIII factor concentrates, initially developed for the treatment of hemophilia A and containing also large amounts of VWF, can be used to treat desmopressin‐unresponsive or intolerant patients with VWD. These VWF/FVIII products vary in VWF/FVIII ratio, depending upon the manufacturing process. As the FVIII defect in VWD is secondary to that of VWF, the endogenous synthesis of FVIII is normal, contrary to hemophilia A. Thus, correction of the VWF defect results also in the correction of FVIII.

### The von Willebrand factor A-1 domain binding aptamer BT200 elevates plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII: a first-in-human trial [^1163ZHsE]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

- **Figure 4**: Von Willebrand factor antigen levels, free A1-domains, and factor VIII activity (%) after multiple doses of BT200 were evaluated. Subjects received 12 mg of BT200 intravenously plus 12 mg subcutaneously on the first day, followed by 12 mg subcutaneously weekly, or a placebo. Data are presented as mean values with 95% confidence intervals (n = 6 for BT200 groups, n = 20 for placebo).

It is noteworthy that one subject developed venous thrombosis and another subject thrombophlebitis at the insertion site of the venous catheter (median cubital vein). These conditions were diagnosed with color-coded duplex sonography, and both events were treated with enoxaparin. One subject received 8000 IE SC once daily, and the other received 4000 IE SC once daily. Additionally, one volunteer developed venous thrombosis of the limb (lower left leg) and was treated with enoxaparin 6000 IE SC for 4 days, followed by edoxaban 60 mg once a day for 11 weeks. Furthermore, he was prescribed compression stockings.

One subject developed thrombophlebitis of the cubital vein and a superficial thrombophlebitis that extended into the great saphenous vein. In this case, factor V Leiden, which predisposes individuals to thrombotic events, was diagnosed. The subject was treated with enoxaparin 8000 IE SC twice daily for 5 days, followed by edoxaban 60 mg orally once daily. Subjects who experienced these events received a single dose of BT200 ≥ 36 mg (3 of 4 subjects, with one also receiving desmopressin), or repeated weekly doses of 12 mg (in the remaining one subject).

### Influence of blood group, von Willebrand factor levels, and age on factor VIII levels in non-severe haemophilia A [^116mW5Uu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Our study has the limitation that we included only patients who were not acutely ill at the time of blood sampling. Thus, we cannot comment on the effect of VWF on FVIII during acute phase reaction. This study is unique with regard to the fact that we simultaneously investigated the important, potentially influencing factors ABO, VWF, and age. Major strengths of our study are that we assessed not only FVIII:C OSA but also FVIII:C CSA and FVIII:Ag levels in HA, which has not been done before. The inclusion of the control group allowed direct comparisons between patients with HA and the general population.

Our data, together with data from the literature, exclude a major influence of ABO on FVIII levels in non-severe haemophilia A. In patients with identical F8 mutation, VWF seems to impact FVIII:C levels. However, in clinical practice, patients are not stratified according to F8 mutations due to the high number of causative F8 mutations. In non-severe HA overall, only minor influences of VWF can be assumed, which were clearly lower in comparison to the impact of VWF on FVIII levels in healthy individuals. Age has a significant but much less important influence in HA compared to the general population. The most probable explanation for these results is that the mutations in the F8 gene have the most substantial impact on FVIII levels compared to the other factors.

We conclude that for the assessment of FVIII levels in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia A, neither ABO nor VWF level have to be taken into account. Age has to be considered a minor modifier.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1175x2eS]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until August 2019. Additionally, we manually searched the reference lists of relevant articles and existing reviews. Studies published in English were included in this review, and we limited the search to studies reporting data on the accuracy of diagnostic tests. The complete search strategy is available in Supplement 1. The prespecified protocol for this review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020147977). This review is reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for diagnostic test accuracy guidelines.

- **Study selection**: The eligibility criteria are discussed below.

- **Studies**: We included studies reporting data on diagnostic test accuracy (cohort studies, cross-sectional studies) for VWD.

- **Participants**: Participants included patients, of any age, presenting to inpatient or outpatient settings with suspected VWD.

- **Index tests for diagnosis**: The following tests were considered in eligible studies: VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent VWF activity (VWF ristocetin cofactor [VWF:RCo], VWF activity assays based on ristocetin-induced binding of VWF to a recombinant wild-type GPIb fragment, and VWF activity assays based on spontaneous binding of VWF to a gain-of-function mutant GPIb fragment). We did not exclude studies based on the timing of when the index test was conducted.

- **Reference standards**: If a reference diagnostic test was not conducted, we accepted clinical follow-up for symptoms alone as a reference standard.

### How I treat von Willebrand disease [^116RuN3r]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

The deficiency or abnormal activity of von Willebrand factor, a multi-adhesive protein that binds platelets to exposed subendothelium and carries factor VIII in circulation, is responsible for von Willebrand disease, the most frequent inherited bleeding disorder. Clinical symptoms are characterized by mucous membrane and soft tissue bleeding, bleeding after surgery, and rarely joint and gastrointestinal bleeding. Intriguingly, factor VIII, the protein deficient in hemophilia A, may also be variably reduced because von Willebrand factor stabilizes it in circulation.

Treatment strategies are well designed for patients with levels of von Willebrand factor activity < 30 U/dL, while the diagnosis and the magnitude of risk may be difficult to assess accurately for subjects with levels between 30 and 50 U/dL. Three types of the disorder have been identified according to partial (type 1) or severe von Willebrand factor quantitative deficiency (type 3), while patients who present variable abnormality of von Willebrand factor structure are categorized as type 2. The aim of treatment is to correct either the abnormal/reduced von Willebrand factor and the associated deficiency of factor VIII, when present.

Desmopressin is able to transiently correct the deficiency of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor for up to 8–12 hours in a significant proportion of patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease and factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels ≥ 10 U/dL. When desmopressin is not suitable (mainly in patients with type 2 and 3 von Willebrand disease) or correction is required but cannot be used for an extended time (e.g. major surgery), von Willebrand factor-containing concentrates, with or without factor VIII, are used.

### High factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels are not risk factors of cryptogenic arterial ischemic stroke in Thai children [^114bSN12]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The association between high factor VIII levels and the risk of arterial ischemic stroke is controversial. Levels of factor VIII can vary based on ethnicity, age, and sex. This study examined 24 Thai children with cryptogenic arterial ischemic stroke and 41 controls, with mean ages (standard deviation) of 11.5 (6.3) and 9.0 (4.7) years, respectively. The study was conducted post-arterial ischemic stroke to avoid the acute phase reaction of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. The levels of factor VIII activity and von Willebrand factor antigen in patients were not significantly different from the controls, with results showing 119.8 ± 41.3% vs 138.0 ± 48.7% (P = 0.29) for factor VIII and 92.8 ± 29.8% vs 103.7 ± 39.1% (P = 0.4) for von Willebrand factor. Consequently, elevated levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor antigen were not identified as risk factors for cryptogenic arterial ischemic stroke in Thai children.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QCV4K]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

For patients with von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels that normalize with age, a repeat evaluation of the bleeding phenotype and consideration of other bleeding disorders should be triggered, particularly if other hemostatic testing (e.g. platelet function testing) was not performed previously. The degree of normalization may influence the decision about how to manage minor procedures (e.g. expectantly or pretreat). It is important to note that some treatments for von Willebrand disease (e.g. tranexamic acid) are also effective for other bleeding disorders. If the diagnosis is removed, there is a fear of undertreatment, particularly if the patient has had prior issues with major bleeding.

This review has several strengths. The comprehensive and systematic approach used to identify studies makes it unlikely that relevant ones were missed. Furthermore, we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework and identified sources of bias.

- **Limitations of this comprehensive systematic review**: The pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates of the tests from this review only apply when the test is performed alone; however, they can be used to model various diagnostic strategies to inform clinical decision-making. Ultimately, the diagnostic tests will be used in a strategic approach based on clinical pre-test probability (PTP) and with consideration of availability, cost, and patient and provider values and preferences.

ABO, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and age influence factor VIII (FVIII) levels in the general population. We investigated the impact of ABO, VWF levels, and age in non‐severe haemophilia A (HA) patients.

- **Investigation findings**: Neither ABO nor VWF had a remarkable influence on FVIII levels in non‐severe HA; age had a minor influence.
- **Conclusion**: For the assessment of baseline FVIII variability, ABO and VWF need not be taken into account.

### How I treat von Willebrand disease [^114b8sh1]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Recent multicenter studies have clarified the molecular basis underlying the different von Willebrand disease (VWD) types, all of which are caused by the deficiency and/or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). These studies have suggested a unifying pathophysiologic concept. The diagnosis of VWD remains difficult because its clinical and laboratory phenotype is very heterogeneous and may overlap with normal subjects. Stringent criteria are therefore required for a clinically useful diagnosis.

In this paper, we delineate a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of VWD. Our approach is based on the critical importance of a standardized bleeding history that has been condensed into a final bleeding score and a few widely available laboratory tests, such as VWF ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen, and factor VIII. This approach would help identify those subjects who will probably benefit from a diagnosis of VWD.

The next step involves performing a trial infusion with desmopressin in all patients who fail to exhibit an enhanced responsiveness to ristocetin. Based on these results and through a series of illustrative examples, the clinician will be able to select the best approach for the optimal management of VWD, according to the patient's characteristics and clinical circumstances.

### The diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: A United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization guideline approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^115WeHtV]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease" serves as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common inherited bleeding disorder. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

The diagnostic process involves two key components. The first is a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding, which is a common symptom in patients with von Willebrand disease. This could include symptoms such as easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.

The second component is a laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL. Von Willebrand factor is a protein that helps blood to clot, and its activity can be measured in a laboratory test. A low level of von Willebrand factor activity is indicative of von Willebrand disease.

The diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is confirmed if both these criteria are met. If either of these criteria is not met, the diagnosis is not confirmed. This binary approach ensures a high degree of specificity in the diagnostic process, reducing the likelihood of false-positive results.

The tool is designed to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease based on two key clinical inputs.

- **The first input**: Assesses whether the individual has a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding.

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^112Wn5Nm]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 174 patients were enrolled, with 1 to 20 patients per center. Of these, 158 received at least one study dose (safety population), and 16 did not require replacement therapy. Three patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis as they were subsequently diagnosed with acquired or pseudo VWD; thus, the efficacy population comprised 155 patients. At the end of the study, 35 patients were prematurely withdrawn: four died, and 31 were lost to follow-up.

Patient demographics of the efficacy cohort included 33 patients (21.3%) with type 1 VWD, 84 (54.2%) with type 2 (2A = 41, 2B = 14, 2M = 8, 2N = 6, 2A/2N = 1, other type 2 = 14), 33 (21.3%) with type 3, and five with a VWD type not clearly classified as type 1 or 2. A total of 119 patients (76.8%) had severe disease defined by VWF:RCo levels ≤ 15 IU/dL according to the European guideline on clinical investigation of human pdVWF product. Regarding the FVIII:C level, 106 patients (68.4%) had levels ≤ 40 IU/dL — a level considered as the minimum suitable hemostatic cut-off level, and 61 (39.4%) had levels < 20 IU/dL.

The pediatric and elderly populations were represented as follows: 14 patients aged < 6 years, 16 between 6 and 11 years, 9 between 12 and 17 years, and 14 aged ≥ 65 years. At study entry, 13 children ≤ 10 years of age, including one with type 3 VWD, had never been exposed to any VWF concentrate.

- **Efficacy**: The majority of patients (123 of 155) were treated on-demand with different clinical settings. LTP was used in 32 patients (20.6%).

### Plasma levels of coagulation factors VIII and IX and risk of venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kQGbH]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Low credibility.

In contrast, most case-control studies of VTE assayed FVIII level 3–6 months after completing a 3–6 month course of anticoagulant therapy, hence within a year of the event. While they assume this time period might allow resolution of acute-phase reactant increases in FVIII, it is possible that FVIII levels might remain higher due to ongoing subclinical thrombosis (reverse causality), which is suggested by the associations of FVIII with increased risk of reVTE. This might result in overestimating its associations with first VTE in case-control studies.

At the date of our literature search, there were two nested case-control studies of FIX and VTE risk but no cohort studies. The first population-based cohort study of FIX was recently published; it reported significant associations for each of FVIII and FIX after risk factor adjustment. However, after adjustment for FVIII, the association of FIX with VTE was attenuated. While the larger MEGA study reported that the association of FIX with VTE remained significant after adjustment for FVIII, further cohort studies of FIX and FVIII would be useful to confirm this finding.

It is useful to define thresholds for high levels at which a clinically significant risk is identified, for example, doubling of risk compared to levels below the threshold. The LETS study used the 90th percentile threshold for FVIII and VTE risk; it reported a joint effect on VTE risk of FVIII and FIX levels above their 90th percentiles. We, therefore, performed additional analyses of these higher-level effects on VTE.

### Predictors of von Willebrand disease diagnosis in individuals with borderline von Willebrand factor plasma levels [^113Eyp4p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

In individuals with borderline von Willebrand factor (VWF) plasma levels, second-level tests are required to confirm or exclude von Willebrand disease (VWD). These tests are time-consuming and expensive.

- **Objective**: To assess which parameters can predict VWD diagnosis in individuals with borderline VWF levels (30–60 IU dL(-1)).

- **Methods**: Nine hundred and fifty individuals with bleeding episodes or abnormal coagulation test results were investigated with first-level tests (blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, blood clotting factor VIII, VWF ristocetin cofactor activity [VWF:RCo], and VWF antigen). Ninety-three individuals (62 females and 31 males; median age 28 years; interquartile range 15–44) had borderline VWF:RCo levels. All underwent second-level investigations to confirm or exclude VWD. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted with sex, age, bleeding score, family history, VWF:RCo, and ABO blood group as predictors, and used to predict VWD diagnosis.

- **Results**: Forty-five of the 93 individuals (48%) had VWD (84% type 1). A negative linear relationship between VWF:RCo levels and risk of VWD diagnosis was present, and was particularly evident with blood group non-O (adjusted odds ratio 7.00 [95% confidence interval 1.48–33.11] for every 5 IU dL(-1) decrease in VWF:RCo). The other variable clearly associated with VWD diagnosis was female sex (adjusted odds ratio 5.76 [95% CI 1.47–22.53]). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the full logistic model was 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.95).

- **Conclusions**: In individual

### Considerations on activity assay discrepancies in factor VIII and factor IX products [^114KaKsL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

New modified coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) products have been designed to improve the treatment of individuals with hemophilia A and B by increasing the interval between dosing. Although these FVIII and FIX molecules have been structurally modified to improve the circulation time, the changes have also influenced their behavior in functional assays in comparison with traditional plasma-derived or recombinant coagulation factors. The assignment of potencies for these products can be problematic because discordance in factor activity values between the commonly used one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays is often observed. Discrepancies in potency assay values also exist when different assay kits and reagents are used in the same assay type. Ideally, all FVIII and FIX products should be calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standards (IS) because the assignment of potencies in international units (IU) helps maintain treatment tradition and meaningful references for manufacturers, patients, and clinicians. The discrepant measurements, attributed to the modified structural and functional properties of these products, are manifested in their lack of commutability with the WHO IS for FVIII or FIX.

Herein, we discuss the considerations upon which an assay is chosen for potency assignment and postadministration monitoring of a new factor product. These considerations include the validity of the assay calibrated with the IS, the meaning of the potency values in IU, standards of care for patients, and the clinical relevance between the assays.

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^111kWyLn]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Although VWF levels are altered in patients with the above-mentioned disorders, the association between these disorders and VWF levels in patients with VWD is unknown. Also, the relationship between comorbidities, mostly occurring at older age, and the age-related increase of VWF levels is unknown.

Therefore, our primary aim was to assess the association between comorbidities and VWF and factor VIII (FVIII) levels in patients with VWD type 1 and 2. The second aim was to study whether comorbidities can explain the previously reported age-related increase of VWF in VWD type 1 patients. Thirdly, we aimed to assess the association between comorbidities and the bleeding phenotype of VWD patients.
