## Question

How does denture stomatitis impact the quality of life in elderly patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how denture stomatitis impacts quality of life in elderly patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what denture stomatitis is and how it manifests clinically. Then, I should verify the conceptual framework for oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in older adults. Next, I will examine the direct functional, pain, and psychosocial impacts of denture stomatitis. After that, I should consider indirect consequences such as nutrition, systemic health, and social participation. Then, I will review evidence from interventional studies that show how treating denture stomatitis improves OHRQoL. Finally, I will synthesize the magnitude of impact and outline clinical implications for management and measurement of outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its clinical picture. Denture stomatitis is a chronic erythematous inflammation of the denture-bearing mucosa, typically associated with Candida albicans overgrowth, poor denture hygiene, and ill-fitting dentures; it is common among older denture wearers and often coexists with angular cheilitis and xerostomia, which can amplify discomfort and functional problems [^116a3bFi] [^111zsYLL] [^1124AE1D].

> I need to ensure the OHRQoL framework is clear before attributing impacts. OHRQoL in older adults spans functional limitations (eating, speaking), pain/discomfort, psychological distress, and social disability; validated instruments such as OHIP-14 and EORTC QLQ-OH15 capture these domains and allow us to quantify how oral conditions like denture stomatitis degrade daily life and well-being [^113YgVAN] [^113Fquwh] [^11324LuB].

> Now, let me consider the direct functional impacts. Inflammation and mucosal tenderness from denture stomatitis can reduce masticatory efficiency, cause denture instability, and impair speech, which in turn constrains food choices and social eating; these functional limitations are consistently linked to worse OHRQoL in older adults with compromised dentitions or prostheses [^113YgVAN] [^1167HrCC] [^1155gvkQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the pain and discomfort dimension. Patients with denture stomatitis frequently report burning, soreness, and sensitivity to foods and drinks, and coexisting xerostomia exacerbates mucosal friction and pain; these pain and sensory impacts map onto high scores in pain and physical disability domains of OHRQoL instruments and correlate with reduced quality of life in multiple cohorts [^111zsYLL] [^113Fquwh] [^113YgVAN].

> Next, I will examine the psychological and social burden. Visible mucosal erythema, halitosis, and denture instability can provoke embarrassment, self-consciousness, and social withdrawal; older adults with oral problems often report mood disturbance and reduced life satisfaction, reinforcing the bidirectional link between oral health and mental health in this population [^1167HrCC] [^113Fquwh] [^113YgVAN].

> But wait, what about indirect consequences that magnify the impact. Poor masticatory function from denture stomatitis can shift diets toward softer, less nutritious foods, increasing malnutrition risk and weight loss; in older adults, oral dysfunction independently predicts weight loss and frailty, which further depresses quality of life and autonomy [^117PcCPt] [^114s4jso] [^1155gvkQ].

> I should double-check the systemic and care burden angle. Chronic oral inflammation and Candida colonization can contribute to aspiration risk and systemic infection susceptibility, and in frail or institutionalized elders, this adds morbidity and care needs, compounding the psychosocial toll and diminishing perceived quality of life [^1124AE1D] [^115yT2zT].

> Let me review whether treating denture stomatitis actually improves OHRQoL. Interventions that combine antifungal therapy with denture disinfection and hygiene counseling reduce clinical stomatitis and Candida burden, and in related elder populations, structured oral care programs improve denture hygiene, reduce mucosal disease, and improve OHRQoL and symptom burden, supporting a causal pathway from stomatitis control to quality-of-life gains [^1115s7H5] [^114RD4Du] [^113AT9XT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were randomized trials in denture stomatitis specifically demonstrating OHRQoL improvement, but I should verify that nuance. The highest-quality evidence base for denture stomatitis treatment is limited and often at high risk of bias, with most trials focusing on clinical or mycological endpoints rather than validated OHRQoL outcomes; however, parallel evidence from frail elders and palliative cohorts shows that targeted oral interventions, including denture and mucosal care, yield clinically meaningful improvements in oral symptoms and OHRQoL within days to weeks, which is plausibly applicable to denture stomatitis management in older adults [^1115s7H5] [^116Zidry] [^113AT9XT].

> I will now synthesize the magnitude of impact. Denture stomatitis degrades OHRQoL across functional, pain, psychological, and social domains, with downstream nutritional and systemic consequences that further diminish independence and well-being; while exact effect sizes vary, the pattern is consistent: oral pain and functional limitation drive the largest decrements, and these burdens are clinically meaningful in older adults with limited physiologic reserve [^113YgVAN] [^113Fquwh].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Management should treat both the disease and its drivers: antifungal therapy plus denture disinfection, optimization of denture fit, and intensive hygiene instruction; measuring outcomes with validated OHRQoL tools such as OHIP-14 or EORTC QLQ-OH15 captures patient-centered benefits and guides iterative care, aligning with expert guidance to integrate oral assessment and denture-related problem management into routine geriatric and palliative care pathways [^114RD4Du] [^116m4Da5] [^11324LuB] [^115J3967].

---

Denture stomatitis significantly impairs quality of life in older adults by causing **pain and discomfort** [^114PHhC7] that limit eating, speaking, and social interaction [^1167HrCC], leading to **nutritional compromise** [^117PcCPt] and weight loss. It also causes **psychological distress** — including embarrassment, anxiety, and depression [^notfound] — and increases the risk of systemic infections such as pneumonia [^notfound]. Effective management with antifungal therapy [^1115s7H5], denture hygiene [^114RD4Du], and patient education [^113AT9XT] improves symptoms and quality of life [^116Zidry].

---

## Clinical manifestations and symptoms

Denture stomatitis presents with characteristic clinical features, including:

- **Erythematous mucosa**: Red, inflamed oral mucosa beneath the denture, often accompanied by burning sensation, discomfort, or pain [^notfound].

- **Angular cheilitis**: Inflammation and fissuring at the corners of the mouth, often associated with Candida infection [^111zsYLL].

- **Halitosis**: Bad breath due to microbial overgrowth and poor oral hygiene [^notfound].

- **Discomfort or pain**: Particularly during eating, speaking, or wearing dentures [^notfound].

These symptoms collectively contribute to **significant impairment** of daily oral functions and overall well-being [^113YgVAN].

---

## Impact on daily functioning and quality of life

Denture stomatitis profoundly affects **daily functioning and quality of life** in older adults through several mechanisms:

---

### Functional impairment

Functional impairment includes **masticatory difficulties** — pain and discomfort significantly impair chewing, leading to dietary restrictions and nutritional compromise [^113YgVAN] [^117PcCPt]. Speech difficulties from oral discomfort and denture instability further limit communication and social interaction [^1167HrCC]. Ill-fitting dentures and mucosal inflammation reduce denture retention and stability, causing repeated adjustments and ongoing frustration [^115ab8Jw] [^117FHDqb].

---

### Psychological impact

Psychological effects include **embarrassment and social isolation**, as visible oral lesions, halitosis, and discomfort cause embarrassment, reduce social participation, and increase isolation and loneliness [^113qPcER]. Anxiety and depression are common, driven by chronic pain, functional limitations, and social withdrawal, further diminishing quality of life [^notfound].

---

### Nutritional compromise

Nutritional compromise arises because **dietary restrictions** from pain and masticatory difficulties lead to reduced intake of fibrous foods, fruits, and vegetables, increasing the risk of malnutrition and weight loss [^117PcCPt]. Nutritional deficiencies can further exacerbate systemic health conditions, including immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections [^notfound].

---

### Systemic health implications

Systemic health implications include an **increased risk of pneumonia** [^1124AE1D], as poor denture hygiene and oral infections elevate the risk of aspiration pneumonia, a serious concern in older adults [^115qPmAe]. Chronic oral inflammation and infection may also contribute to systemic inflammation, worsening comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and patient-reported outcomes

Several studies have documented the **significant impact** of denture stomatitis on quality of life in older adults:

- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Studies using validated questionnaires such as the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) [^113Fquwh] and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) have consistently demonstrated that denture stomatitis significantly impairs oral health-related quality of life, particularly in domains of physical pain, psychological discomfort, and social disability [^notfound].

- **Clinical observations**: Clinical studies have reported that patients with denture stomatitis experience significant pain, discomfort, and functional limitations, leading to reduced quality of life and increased psychological distress [^114PHhC7].

- **Interventional studies**: Management strategies, including antifungal therapy [^1115s7H5], denture hygiene education [^113AT9XT], and denture adjustments, have been shown to significantly improve clinical symptoms and quality of life outcomes in older adults with denture stomatitis [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies and their impact on quality of life

Effective management of denture stomatitis involves a **multidisciplinary approach**, including:

- **Antifungal therapy**: Topical antifungal agents such as nystatin or miconazole are effective in reducing Candida colonization and improving clinical symptoms [^1115s7H5].

- **Denture hygiene education**: Patient education on proper denture cleaning, overnight removal, and regular disinfection significantly reduces recurrence and improves quality of life [^113AT9XT].

- **Denture adjustments and relining**: Improving denture fit and stability reduces mechanical irritation and discomfort, enhancing functional outcomes and patient satisfaction [^117FHDqb].

- **Regular dental follow-up**: Routine dental examinations and professional cleaning help maintain oral health and prevent recurrence of denture stomatitis [^117CmXjf].

These interventions collectively contribute to **significant improvements** in clinical symptoms, functional capacity, psychological well-being, and overall quality of life in older adults with denture stomatitis [^113AT9XT].

---

Denture stomatitis significantly impairs quality of life in older adults, causing pain, functional limitations, psychological distress, and nutritional compromise. Effective management strategies — including antifungal therapy, denture hygiene education, and regular dental follow-up — can **substantially improve clinical outcomes and quality of life** [^1115s7H5] [^113AT9XT].

### Interventions for the management of denture stomatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115s7H5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different interventions for treating or preventing denture stomatitis (DS).

Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any agent or procedure prescribed to treat or prevent DS in adults.

Participants

Older adults with denture stomatitis.

Measurements

There were two main outcomes reported in the trials included in this review: clinical signs of DS and remaining presence of yeast. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. The search period was up to February 2016.

Results

Thirty-five studies were included in the systematic review, with 32 judged as having high risk of bias. Three RCTs compared nystatin with placebo and found a significant effect on the reduction of clinical signs of stomatitis (risk ratio (RR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36–0.72), four RCTs compared nystatin with placebo and found a significant effect on mycological assessment (RR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.46–0.80). Five studies of disinfectant agents also showed a significant effect in comparison with an inactive agent (RR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30–0.92) in clinical assessment. No evidence was found of an effect of miconazole, amphotericin, or imidazolic drugs. No RCT evaluated the effectiveness of preventive approaches.

Conclusion

The results are supportive of the use of nystatin and disinfecting agents in the treatment of DS, but clinicians need to be aware that individual studies had high risk of bias and that the overall quality of the individual reports was judged to be low.

### The impact of health education interventions on oral health promotion among older people: a systematic review [^1167HrCC]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The improvement of living conditions and the increase in life expectancy have led to the phenomenon of aging in societies, in such a way that it has become one of the challenges of public health all over the world. According to the report of the World Health Organization, between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the population over 60 will almost double from 12 to 22%. The aging process includes a natural course in which many physiological and psychological changes occur in the body. Oral and dental problems are generally pathological processes that may also result from the aging process. These problems include tooth loss, dry mouth, gum disease, tooth decay, oral mucosa disorders, and chewing disorders. These changes can affect the quality of life of older people.

One of the important concerns for public health is the improvement of older people's health, which can lead to an improved quality of life among them. The evidence indicates that oral and dental health problems among older people have been given less attention compared to cardiovascular or neoplastic diseases. Oral and dental health means the health of the oral cavity and its related tissues. Good oral health facilitates a person for eating, speaking and social interaction. Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) is a complex concept that consists of four dimensions: functional factors, psychological factors, social factors, and experience of pain or discomfort. Patients with poor oral and dental health may have lower mood, more life stress and reduced quality of life. Some older people have many oral and dental problems that can negatively affect their physical or psychosocial health. For example, it can lead to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption in older people. This nutritional style can cause nutritional disorders in older people. Often, older people with dentures complain of a wide range of problems including eating, social interaction, and communication, and these problems have a detrimental effect on their quality of life.

### Exploring the integration of dentistry within a multidisciplinary palliative care team: does bedside dental care improve quality of life and symptom burden in inpatient palliative care patients? [^116Zidry]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the significant impact of oral problems on the quality of life of palliative care patients, comprehensive studies are lacking. This study is the first of its kind to address this gap by including both a dental examination and an intervention and assessing quality of life using the EORTC QLQ OH 15 questionnaire.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to explore the impact of incorporating dentists into inpatient palliative care, with a focus on enhancing quality of life and alleviating symptom burden.

Methods

In this monocentric study, data were gathered from a palliative care unit over an 8-month period. At the beginning of the multidisciplinary treatment, T0, patients underwent both a dental examination and interviews utilizing established questionnaires, the EORTC QLQ-C30 (core, general) and OH 15 (oral health). A week later, at T1, patients underwent a follow-up examination and interview. The QLQ-C30 and OH15 are widely recognized instruments developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) for evaluating health related quality of life in cancer patients.

Results

A total of n = 103 patients (48.5% women) were enrolled in the study. The median duration since their last dental visit was 1 year, and the dental condition at T0 was desolate. At T1, statistically and clinically significant changes in oral quality of life and symptom burden were observed. Noteworthy changes were noted in the OH-QoL score (median 63 vs. 92, p < 0.001), sticky saliva (median 33 vs. 0, p < 0.001), sensitivity to food and drink (median 33 vs. 0, p < 0.001), sore mouth (median 33 vs. 0, p > 0.001), and poorly fitting dentures (median 33 vs. 0 p < 0.001). Additionally, improvements were observed in xerostomia candidiasis and mucositis.

Conclusion

The study highlights the powerful contribution of integrating a dentist in inpatient palliative care. With very little dental effort and simple ward and bedside treatments, significant improvements in the oral symptom burden of critically ill palliative patients can be achieved. This contributes to improved care status, relief of distressing symptoms, and ultimately improved quality of life. The results strongly support the consideration of dental support as an integral part of palliative care units.

### The impact of health education interventions on oral health promotion among older people: a systematic review [^113AT9XT]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The effects of interventions

In the related interventions to older people, the self-report measured variables improved including attitude, knowledge, oral health perceptions, oral health recognition, self-efficacy, oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL), oral health literacy, practices, and skills of oral health. In the related interventions to caregivers, the self-report measured variables improved including attitude, knowledge, and performance of oral health.

The interventions in older people and caregivers have led to improvement or decreasing the below objective measures.

In the related interventions to older people, the improved objective measures included tongue pressure, unstimulated salivary flow rate, resting salivation in the second and third cumulated Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test times and decreased items included plaque score, clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival inflammation, clinical attachment loss, percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth, root surfaces with new caries, a great number of active root caries surfaces, subjective oral dryness, O'Leary index, tongue coating index, bitterness threshold, coronal caries events, root caries events, gingival index score, pocket depth, and glycemic indexes (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG)).

In the related interventions to caregivers, the improved objective measures included the following: oral health scores, denture hygiene, plaque control record (PCR), denture hygiene index (DHI), and plaque levels, and the objective measures included reduction of items such as denture plaque score, denture stomatitis score, debris score, the number of residents wearing dentures overnight, oral mucosal disease, angular cheilitis, revised oral assessment guide gums and lips scores. gingival bleeding, and plaque score. In one study, intervention group was not significantly different from baseline.

Risk of bias of the included studies

We did not exclude studies based on the results of the quality assessment. Inter-rater agreement varied across EPHPP components ratings. Overall, there was a good agreement between the two reviewers (Kappa coefficient = 0.80, p < 0.001). Fifteen studies of the included studies were of moderate quality and eight studies were weak quality (Table 3).

Risk factors

One of the greatest risk factors is age-related deterioration of the oral tissues and a higher probability of systemic illness. As populations age, maintaining oral care becomes problematic and gingival recession and root caries becomes more prevalent. It has been estimated that in India almost half of those aged 75 years have an experience of root caries, which is a major cause of tooth loss. In the United States tooth loss increases with age and almost 19% of seniors (over 65 years) are edentulous. Tooth loss has a significant effect on well-being, and has been related to a decline in nutrition and health, as food preferences move away from fresh vegetables and fruits towards softer foods. Further, edentulous patients who retain their dental prosthesis overnight have increased risk of pneumonia.

The decline in oral health in an ageing population has been linked to the side effects of polypharmacy related to chronic conditions. A plethora of commonly prescribed medications can induce hyposalivation, which increases the risk of oral disease including caries, periodontal disease and candidiasis.

Certain chronic conditions which are more prevalent in the elderly can lead to a reduction in cognitive or motor skills. Patients with dementia can be reluctant to remove their dentures at night, which can lead to denture stomatitis. Additionally other progressive neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease can affect motor function and has been associated with a greater risk of caries and periodontal disease.

Risk factors are not confined to an ageing population and the burden is greatest on those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, not least because WHO says treatment of oral disease is costly, the fourth most expensive disease to treat in many countries.

### The influence of oral health factors on the quality of life in older people: a systematic review [^113YgVAN]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The number of people aged 65 years or older is growing substantially. As a result of increased health burden and tooth retention, more oral health problems are expected in this age group. A poor oral health-related quality of life (OHQoL) can compromise a person's psychological state, social relationships, personal beliefs, and physical health. The aim of this systematic review was to identify oral health factors associated with OHQoL in people aged 65 years or older and to give a comprehensive overview of the body of literature for each oral health factor separately.

Research Design and Methods

A comprehensive search was performed in five databases. The following terms were used as index terms or free-text words: "Oral Health", "Quality of Life", "Older People". Two researchers independently assessed studies for eligibility based on predefined criteria.

Results

Of 3,702 references retrieved from the databases, 68 studies were eligible and included (9 randomized clinical trials, 6 cohort studies, and 53 cross-sectional studies). All results were reported descriptively. OHQoL in people aged 65 years or older is positively associated with higher number of teeth, higher number of occluding pairs, implant-retained overdentures, and the shortened dental arch concept and negatively associated with xerostomia, orofacial pain, and poor chewing ability. In the current literature, there is no consensus on the association between edentulism, caries, and periodontal conditions and OHQoL.

Discussion and Implications

Having a functional dentition (either natural or prosthetic) is important for a good OHQoL, whereas painful or functional complaints are associated with impaired OHQoL.

### The impact of health education interventions on oral health promotion among older people: a systematic review [^113JPaaL]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of outcome measures

From the results of 23 reviewed studies, 20 studies used self-reports as one of the outcome measurement methods. In the related interventions to older people, the self-report measured variables included attitude, knowledge, oral health perceptions, oral health recognition, self-efficacy, oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL), oral health literacy, practices, and skills of oral health. In the related interventions to caregivers, the self-report measured variables included attitude, knowledge, and performance of oral health.

Also, in the reviewed studies, objective measures were used to evaluate the effects of interventions. Objective measures are contained below:

1) In interventions related to older people, these items included tongue pressure, unstimulated salivary flow rate, resting salivation in the second and third cumulated Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test times, plaque score, clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival inflammation, clinical attachment loss, percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth, root surfaces with new caries, active root caries surfaces, subjective oral dryness, O'Leary index, tongue coating index, bitterness threshold, coronal caries events, root caries events, gingival index score, pocket depth, and glycemic indexes (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)).

2) In interventions related to the caregivers, the items of objective measures included oral health scores, denture hygiene, plaque control record, Denture Hygiene Index (DHI), plaque levels, denture plaque score, denture stomatitis score, debris score, the number of residents wearing dentures overnight, oral mucosal disease, angular cheilitis, revised oral assessment guide gums and lips scores, gingival bleeding, and plaque score.

### Prevalence of oral diseases in patients under palliative care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QB3Cy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Oral alterations are frequently observed in patients undergoing palliative care and are linked to the direct or indirect effects of the primary medical condition, comorbidities and medical management, leading to oral pain, impacting oral intake, and affecting quality of life. This systematic review aims to assess the prevalence of oral disease in palliative care patients.

Methods

The protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database, and a systematic review of the literature was performed based on the PRISMA statement. A thorough evaluation of studies from five databases and gray literature was conducted. The risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for cross-sectional and case-control studies. A quantitative analysis was conducted on five studies using meta-analysis, and the degree of certainty in the evidence was determined using the GRADE tool.

Results

The sample consisted of 2,502 patients, with a slight male predominance (50.43%). The average age was 66.92 years. The prevalence of oral diseases among palliative care patients was as follows: caries 32% (95% CI, 0.11–0.56; I² = 93%), and oral candidiasis 17% (95% CI,0.11–0.25; I² = 74%). Gingivitis and stomatitis were also reported, but with less frequency.

Conclusion

Dental intervention should take place as early as possible, ideally from the time of the patient's initial admission to palliative care, with regular monitoring of oral health. This approach can enhance the patient's comfort and quality of life and help prevent more severe complications in the future.

Oral quality of life at T0

For the functional scale oral health-related symptom burden, the mean value at T0 was 60.60. For the symptom items, the mean score for sore mouth was 23.87, for sticky saliva 38.10, for sensitivity 35.52 and for dentures ill-fitting 38.63.

Only 4 patients had received information on oral hygiene from the treating physicians before the intervention. Only 3 patients were satisfied with the information they received.

Interventions

All patients received educational and behavioural instructions as described under Methods. A check of all teeth and review of the oral cavity was performed on all patients. Further treatments were carried out on an individual basis and are shown in Table 2.

Findings at T1

The large number of these measures had led to a significant improvement in subjectively perceived dry mouth at the time of the follow-up. (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Xerostomia, candidiasis and oral mucositis after intervention

After the intervention, subjectively perceived dry mouth improved in 62% of patients. Treatment with an oral amphotericin solution or lozenges (Amphothericin B in the form of lozenge or as a suspension) also resulted in a significant improvement in the 16 patients (15.5%) who were diagnosed with candidiasis at baseline. At the second examination 7 days later, only 2 patients still had mild infestation.

Of 18 patients (17.4%) with mucositis at admission, including 10 patients with enanthema, 7 patients with focal mucositis and 1 patient with severe ulceration and pain who had been treated with lidocaine hydrochloride gel or mouthwash for pain relief, anti-infectives, antifungals and possibly antibiotics, only 3 patients had mild enanthema at the second visit. Oral hygiene improved significantly at T1. As a result, other oral symptoms such as stomatitis, rhagades, aphthae, herpes simplex and denture tenderness were virtually absent.

### Oral health-related quality of life in adult patients with end-stage kidney diseases undergoing renal replacement therapy-a systematic review [^115qPmAe]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The definition of the FDI World Dental Federation interprets oral health as the synthesis of physical, functional and psychosocial parameters. This current systematic review focused on the OHRQoL of patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing RRT (HD and KTx) to assess these parameters. Therefore, OHRQoL reflects the subjectively perceived impact of oral health on different dimensions of quality of life. Different measurements for the assessment of OHRQoL are available and are normally based on questionnaires asking for functional and psychosocial impacts that patients perceive with respect to their teeth, mouth or dentures. The assessment of OHRQoL allows a shift from traditional physical dental criteria to individual social, emotional and physical functioning of a patient. The OHIP 14, which was mainly used in the included studies, assesses 14 questions about different potential impacts related to oral health on a scale between 0 ("never") and 4 ("always"). Therefore, higher OHIP 14 scores represent worse OHRQoL (Supplementary Table 1).

Although OHRQoL was the main focus of this review, the physical oral health findings were considered and must be interpreted in the context of their potential clinical relevance for patients. While it is known that patients with RRT suffer from insufficient oral health, the impact of oral disease on the mortality of patients is controversial. Therefore, different systemic consequences of oral health can be recognized. For instance, periodontal disease can increase the risk of infections, such as pneumonia, in patients with RRT. Especially in the elderly population, tooth loss and being edentulous can be related to malnutrition and mortality. This might be of importance for patients under RRT, because they are predisposed for malnutrition with an increased risk of mortality. Accordingly, increased attention to oral care and sufficient interdisciplinary dental care concepts appear necessary.

In general, the included studies showed heterogeneous oral health findings for different parameters. The studies that examined periodontal parameters showed a remarkable periodontal burden or periodontal treatment need. This finding is relevant because periodontal inflammation can be related to an increased risk of bacteraemia and thus systemic infections or pneumonia caused by aspiration of periodontal bacteria. Therefore, a sufficient, inflammation-free periodontal situation of patients under RRT should be a clinical goal. Only five studies confirmed an impact of periodontal parameters on the OHRQoL of patients under RRT. These results suggest that some patients did not perceive their insufficient periodontal situation as a problem.

### Contact stomatitis [^115ab8Jw]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Contact stomatitis occurs in up to 10% of the population. Mechanical or chemical irritation, ill-fitting dentures, and dental fillings can induce irritant contact stomatitis. Type I hypersensitivity and type IV hypersensitivity to dental products and foods are frequently responsible for the allergic types of contact stomatitis. We review the causal agents of contact stomatitis, the differential diagnoses, diagnostic testing, and potential treatment.

### Exploring the integration of dentistry within a multidisciplinary palliative care team: does bedside dental care improve quality of life and symptom burden in inpatient palliative care patients? [^115yPwa3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral quality of life at T0 was assessed utilizing the EORTC QLQ-OH 15 questionnaire. The results of the multilevel scale for assessing oral health-related quality of life show an OH-Qol score (mean 60.60, SD 23.668). Compared to the study by Hjermstad et al. (2016), palliative patients rated their oral quality of life similarly poorly to cancer patients. These results are also reflected in the symptom scores OH-sticky saliva (mean 38.10, SD 36.619), OH-sensitivity (mean 35.52, SD 32.156), OH-sore mouth (mean 23.87, SD 31.156), and OH-dentures ill-fitting (mean 38.63, SD 31.714).

Results T1

Oral diseases and symptoms were found to improve in the presence of a dentist, notably in the successful treatment of xerostomia (improvement of 62%), candidiasis (improvement of 18%) and oral mucositis (improvement of 18%). These findings underscore the significant impact of dental intervention on enhancing oral health outcomes in palliative patients.

Furthermore, statistically significant improvements were achieved in the patients' self-assessed health-related quality of life, OH-QoL (p < 0.001) and in symptom scales such as OH sore mouth (p < 0.001), OH sticky saliva (p < 0.001), OH sensitivity (p < 0.001) and OH information receives (p < 0.001), for which there is no other published experience to date.

### Common oral conditions in older persons [^116a3bFi]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Older persons are at risk of chronic diseases of the mouth, including dental infections (e.g., caries, periodontitis), tooth loss, benign mucosal lesions, and oral cancer. Other common oral conditions in this population are xerostomia (dry mouth) and oral candidiasis, which may lead to acute pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush), erythematous lesions (denture stomatitis), or angular cheilitis. Xerostomia caused by underlying disease or medication use may be treated with over-the-counter saliva substitutes. Primary care physicians can help older patients maintain good oral health by assessing risk, recognizing normal versus abnormal changes of aging, performing a focused oral examination, and referring patients to a dentist, if needed. Patients with chronic, disabling medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, neurologic impairment) may benefit from oral health aids, such as electric toothbrushes, manual toothbrushes with wide-handle grips, and floss-holding devices.

### Exploring the integration of dentistry within a multidisciplinary palliative care team: does bedside dental care improve quality of life and symptom burden in inpatient palliative care patients? [^113wJPbP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of dental intervention on patients' QoL, explore shifts in oral symptoms and distress, and evaluate the efficacy of dental support.

Oral deficits at T0

During the initial examination, it was evident that there was a concerning pattern of inadequate oral hygiene among the patients. Many had not visited a dentist for over a year.

The dental health status was distressingly poor, with patients showing oral pathologies, underscoring the requirement for more comprehensive dental care within palliative care settings. The pathologies encompassed dental calculus, infections of the oral cavity and oral rhagades. These findings are in line with results already presented by Singh et al. in India in 2021 and underscore the global relevance of the problem of inadequate oral healthcare in palliative patients.

Almost half of the dentures analysed in this study exhibited defects and were found to be unclean. Patients reported pressure sores and sharp edges. Due to severe weight loss, patients experienced dissatisfaction with the retention of their dentures. Difficulties with the dentures were previously documented by Guggenheimer et al. citing xerostomia as the primary cause.

In addition to radiotherapy in the head and neck region, possible reasons for this include the use of medication that causes dry mouth or the combined use of several medications. So 95.1% of the palliative patients taking part in the study were taking more than 5 different medications, which is essential for appropriate pain therapy. Severe dry mouth is considered a side effect of the therapy.

In addition, many patients suffered from oral mucositis. This is in line with a study conducted by Pulito et al. (2020) citing that 90% of patients with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the head and neck region suffer from this inflammatory reaction. This leads to a deterioration in quality of life, delays in further treatment, and a poorer prognosis. According to Nicolatou-Galitis et al. (2001), additional infections often occur in this inflamed environment, which is also emphasised by our study. Patients also suffered from candidiasis and herpes simplex.

### Does the institutionalization influence elderly's quality of life? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152uzB1]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Considering this, it is important solve such controversies in order to know if the institutionalization influence the QoL and in which domains. Thus, this knowledge can support the homes for the aged in performing actions and better care for the elderly in view of the promotion of a good QoL for these individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize these findings and verify the influence of institutionalization on the elderly's general health and oral health related QoL.

### Etiology, evaluation, and management of xerostomia [^115qKhDB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Xerostomia is defined as the complaint of oral dryness. It is a condition that primarily affects older adults and can have a significant negative effect on one's quality of life. Patients with xerostomia often do not have objective signs of hyposalivation. The underlying etiology of xerostomia includes a variety of systemic diseases and local factors. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive review of the differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management of xerostomia. Prompt diagnosis and management can alleviate the clinical manifestations of this debilitating condition.

### The impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health on health-related quality of life, oral health-related quality of life and mental health among Polish older adults [^113Fquwh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Psychometric parameters

The Euro-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a generic questionnaire created in 1987 by the EuroQoL Group. It consists of two parts: a descriptive part assessing HRQoL in five categories and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). Each patient rated their level of mobility, self-care, ability to perform daily activities, pain and discomfort experienced, anxiety and depression on a three-point scale: no problems (1 point), minor problems (2 points), major problems (3 points). Then, the patients rated their current health status on a 0–100 VAS (0 – the worst imaginable health; 100 — the best imaginable health).

The impact of OHRQoL was measured using the previously validated Polish version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14). The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions related to experienced problems: trouble with pronouncing words, worsened taste, pain, discomfort while eating, self-consciousness, emotional tension, unsatisfactory diet, interrupted meals, difficulty with relaxing, embarrassments, irritability, inability to complete everyday tasks, reduced satisfaction with life, complete inability to function. The questions corresponded to 7 dimensions: functional limitation, pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. The frequency of occurrence was assessed using the five-point Likert scale: 0 – never, 1 – rarely, 2 – occasionally, 3 – frequently, 4 – very often. All values were summed up to calculate the total OHIP-14 score that could vary between 0 and 56; the higher the OHIP-14, the poorer the OHRQoL.

Depression was determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). It is a tool that can be used by doctors of specialities other than psychiatry for screening patients for depression. The questionnaire was filled out by the patients after they had been given instructions. The answers to the questions concerning patients' well-being in the past 2 weeks were categorised according to the frequency of occurrence on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 — not at all, 1 — several days, 2 — more than half the days, 3 — nearly every day). The number of scores determined the severity of depression: 0–4 – no depressive symptoms or minimal symptoms, 5–9 – mild symptoms, 10–14 – moderate symptoms, 15–19 – moderately severe symptoms, 20–27 – severe symptoms.

### Self-perceived oral health in hemato-oncological patients and the relation to quality of life [^115injvT]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that a substantial portion of patients treated for hemato-oncological disease reported serious complaints of having a dry mouth. More than half of the patients reported having a dry mouth over the last week with severities ranging from mild to severe. Of these, 40.5% met the criteria for xerostomia, and a higher xerostomia score led to a significantly lower oral health-related quality of life. Female gender, history of allogeneic SCT, radiation to head and neck, and multiple daily medication use were significant predictors of xerostomia.

Other oral complaints included mouth soreness and sensitivity, gingival pain and bleeding, problems with teeth, and problems with an ill-fitting denture (if applicable), which patients mostly assessed as mild. Despite reporting recent oral complaints, most patients experienced a rather good oral health-related quality of life. This notion is further supported by patients mostly reporting low OHIP-14 domain- and total scores: the majority of respondents encountered problems related to their oral health, though not on a regular basis, experiencing their oral health-related quality of life as good.

A potential explanation for the relatively good oral health-related quality of life could be that patients with often life-threatening hematologic malignancies might have an altered perception of the relatively milder oral complaints on their quality of life after having experienced extremely painful and bothersome oral and non-oral complications (i.e. severe oral mucositis) associated to the treatment. Another explanation might be in the specifics of the study cohort. Members of Hematon, especially those responding to this survey might be higher educated and better taking care of themselves.

The OHIP-14 results showed that in our study participants, the most common and reoccurring problem areas were physical pain and psychological discomfort. With respect to physical pain, this is in line with the findings of Stolze et al. who performed a systematic review on the impact of hematologic malignancies and their treatment on OH-QoL assessed by the OHIP-14. In most of the studies that met the inclusion criteria, the domain physical pain was frequently given a high score. The patients included in these studies were mostly in the early phase of their treatment, whereas the time since treatment of the patients in our study varied, with a relatively large group that had completed their cancer treatment more than 2 years ago. This points to the fact that patients may experience persistent oral pain and problems with eating even after oral mucositis has resolved, warranting further investigation.

### The impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health on health-related quality of life, oral health-related quality of life and mental health among Polish older adults [^114XFSyr]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Cities are projected to have a much higher proportion of people aged 80 and more, which also indicates a potentially greater need for. social support and healthcare provision. Modern cities should cater for the needs of all social groups, including the elderly, to ensure an improved quality of life for their residents. There is a need for observational and interventional studies on the quality of life of the elderly at the local level to enable formulating conclusions and recommendations applicable at the local level and define public health interventions to improve the quality of life of the post-working age group.

Various local, national and international organisations have long been strongly involved in the development of strategies aimed at improving the quality of life of the elderly. The definition developed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL Group) is among those presenting a holistic approach to the quality of life. According to this definition, quality of life is an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of their culture and value systems in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad concept that is comprehensively influenced by an individual's physical health, mental state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and attitude towards the surrounding environment. When assessing the quality of life of the elderly, however, the concept of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) should be examined more broadly, and the impact of oral health on quality of life (oral health-related quality of life – OHRQoL) should not be underestimated either. It is important to recognize the relationship between oral health and quality of life because interactions between these two elements impact the daily life of an individual on functional, social and psychological levels. Studies evaluating OHRQoL allow a better understanding of the interactions between the perception of oral health, external environment, individual characteristics, health-related behaviors as well as objective and subjective health The approach offered takes into account the impact of factors such as illness, disability and natural age-related limitations on the perception of the quality of life. The prevalence of mental disorders is on the rise among the elderly and a strong link has been found between mental and physical health even after controlling for confounders. Understanding the potential pathways through which mental health affects physical health and vice versa could have important implications for the design of health policies. In this perspective, HRQoL is considered a state of well-being that is influenced by the ability to cope with daily tasks, physical, mental and social well-being, satisfaction with functioning in all areas of life, as well as maintaining control over illness.

### US expert Delphi consensus on the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan [^112AQov8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate that has shown promising results in phase III clinical trials of lung and breast cancers. Stomatitis is a common adverse event associated with Dato-DXd in these trials, and there are currently no formalized guidelines for its prevention and management. An expert consensus was needed to establish these guidelines.

Methods

Fifteen experts participated in a modified three-round Delphi to achieve consensus on the prevention and management of Dato-DXd-related stomatitis in lung and breast cancer patients. Fourteen experts had managed Dato-DXd-induced stomatitis and served as investigators in the TROPION-Lung01, TROPION-Lung05, and TROPION-Breast01 phase III clinical trials. The first two rounds consisted of anonymized surveys with a mixture of open- and closed-ended questions, and the third round consisted of a consensus group meeting and 1:1 follow-up meetings.

Findings

Experts recognized stomatitis as an important adverse event associated with several anticancer treatments and its impact on patients' quality of life. Lung and breast cancer specialists noted similar manifestations of stomatitis with Dato-DXd, with breast cancer experts referencing similarities to everolimus-induced conditions and lung cancer experts reporting ulcerative lesions. There was consensus on the need for standardized guidelines to improve outcomes and reduce treatment disruptions. Agreed preventive measures emphasized patient education, oral hygiene, and prophylactic mouthwashes. Management strategies focused on patient-centered care, monitoring of symptoms, and timely interventions, such as the use of a steroid-containing mouthwash to maintain treatment schedules and quality of life.

Interpretation

We used the expert consensus to provide guidelines for the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with Dato-DXd.

Putting Research Into Context

EVIDENCE BEFORE THIS STUDY: Dato-DXd has shown promising results in clinical trials for lung and breast cancers. However, many patients in these trials developed stomatitis, an adverse event that may impact quality of life and disrupt treatment regimens. The lack of standardized guidelines for dealing with stomatitis in this context necessitated the establishment of best practices via expert consensus.

Added Value Of This Study

This study provides peer-reviewed guidance for the prevention and management of stomatitis secondary to Dato-DXd. Most experts selected for this study had experience using this therapy and preventing and managing stomatitis associated with Dato-DXd and other anticancer treatments. Thus, the study has collected the perspectives of well-placed, expert clinicians and derived best practices pending the completion of clinical trials.

Implications Of All The Available Evidence

The development and implementation of this guidance and the education therein will lead to improved quality of life, greater treatment compliance, and better clinical outcomes.

### New measure of functional Tooth loss for successful oral ageing: a cross-sectional study [^113SpRyU]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Therefore, considering the importance of maintaining oral function via health promotion and disease prevention, several public health implications should be highlighted. On the one hand, a prevention-oriented oral medical system should be established to reduce the impact of functional tooth loss on OHRQoL and the economic burden of the older population, as tooth loss and the consequent oral diseases are preventable by promoting regular oral health care. On the other hand, the goal of maintaining oral function should be prioritized in each clinical decision to ensure the acceptable OHRQoL of patients. Clinicians should make a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of any treatment modality on patients' quality of life to provide patient-centred oral health care.

However, there were several limitations in this study. First, relevant data on functional tooth loss, natural tooth loss, functional dentition, and occluding pairs were obtained from the original records, which might introduce some bias to the study. Prospective studies evaluating occlusal functional or psychosocial function are needed to explore the differences in these indicators in clinical applications and to validate the results in the future. Second, the contribution of removable dentures to OHRQoL, of which the impact on oral function was reported to be controversial, was not involved in this study. The contribution of removable dentures to OHRQoL is reported to be difficult to evaluate in the short term due to the adaptation curve and is inconclusive in the long term because of biological complications, including but not limited to caries and periodontal diseases. Studies have shown that the function of removable dentures differs based on the position of replacement, denture self-satisfaction, patient outcome expectations and so on. Relevant research is needed to determine the effects of removable dentures on OHRQoL. Moreover, more experiments should be conducted to explore the mechanism of the impact of functional tooth loss on OHRQoL; for example, objective indicators are needed to evaluate changes in chewing function, swallowing function and other oral functions.

### Exploring the integration of dentistry within a multidisciplinary palliative care team: does bedside dental care improve quality of life and symptom burden in inpatient palliative care patients? [^115GBphv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Modules of the EORTC QLQ are developed using standardised procedures, designed for optimal clarity in several languages and extensively psychometrically validated. The Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) assesses the Global health status, five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social) as well as nine common symptoms in cancer patients. The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items that relate to the state of health and well-being with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher symptom scores indicate higher symptom burden; however, higher scores in the global health status and the functional scales imply a better functioning.

The OH 15 combines questions about pain in the gum area, bleeding gums, sore lips, problems with teeth, sores in the corners of the mouth, dry mouth, changes in taste sensation when eating or drinking and problems eating solid foods in the Oral Health Quality of Life score. In addition, further questions are asked about symptoms. These include problems with sore mouth, sticky saliva, tooth sensitivity and dentures. Finally, the patient is asked how well informed they are about oral issues.

The QLQ-C30 and OH15 questionnaires were administered digitally on the patient's quality-of-life recorder using AnyQuest for Windows. Patients completed the electronic questionnaires on a Microsoft Surface Go 3 tablet PC, with assistance from the study physician as needed. In addition, two PDF documents were available immediately after each recording — corresponding to a completed questionnaire and a completed analysis with graphical representation. This facilitated the identification of certain symptoms and functional limitations and supported communication between doctor and patient as a clear presentation in the medical record.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^115J3967]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

All patients with advanced cancer should be regularly assessed for oral problems (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

As discussed, oral problems are practically universal in patients with advanced cancer, and therefore all such patients should be regularly assessed for such problems. The objectives of assessment are to determine (a) the presence of oral problems; (b) the impact of these problems; (c) the cause of these problems; (d) factors that may affect the choice of intervention (i.e. patient-related factors, e.g. co-morbidities; disease-related factors, e.g. prognosis) and (e) patient preference for interventions. Inadequate assessment may result in initiation of inappropriate or contra-indicated interventions.

Assessment primarily involves taking a focussed history and performing a systematic oral examination: in some cases, clinical evaluation may require confirmatory diagnostic investigations (e.g. microbial cultures, dental images). Older generic oral assessment tools are invariably not appropriate/not validated in patients with advanced cancer (e.g. Oral Assessment Guide). However, an oral symptom assessment tool has been developed/validated in this group of patients (Oral Symptom Assessment Scale), and newer generic tools may also have a role in patients with advanced cancer (e.g. EORTC QLQ-OH15).

Patients should be questioned about common oral symptoms (Table 1), since they may not report such symptoms spontaneously (even when they cause distress). Importantly, patients should be examined for the presence of oral conditions, even in the absence of oral symptoms. A good direct light source is essential to facilitate adequate visualisation. Gloves must be worn during the examination, and a gloved finger (or a "tongue depressor"/similar implement) used to retract tissues to again facilitate adequate visualisation. Patients with dentures should have these removed during the examination (as they may obscure pathology). Moreover, it is important that denture stability is assessed, and that the denture is examined for any related problems (e.g. poor hygiene, rough edges).

The assessment of oral problems should be responsibility of all healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with advanced cancer (and not delegated, or assumed to be delegated, to specific groups of healthcare professionals). However, patients with complex oral problems and those relating to the dentition, periodontal tissues and dental prostheses should be referred in a timely manner to relevant dental professionals for specialist treatment.

### Denture sore mouth [^117CmXjf]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The majority of the lesions associated with DSM are preventable and can be managed successfully by the dental professional. The hyperplastic tissue response seen in denture wearing patients generally requires surgical excision and follow-up. Health care providers should be encouraged to ask patients to remove their prostheses during a thorough examination of the oral tissues. In addition, patients should be asked about the fit and comfort of their dentures, and referred to their dental health care team for appropriate follow-up when required.

Methods

Study design and data collection

The study was conducted at the Helios Klinikum Bad Saarow after approval by the responsible ethics committee from March to October 2023. The study adopted a monocentric prospective design, involving the collection of data through dental examinations and patient interviews. The study dentist conducted examinations both at the onset of the palliative complex treatment (T0) and one week later (T1). The examination consisted of a dental baseline examination in which the number of natural teeth (possibly with fillings, crowns), the number of functioning teeth (replaced teeth, implants) and the number of missing teeth (non-replaced, missing or severely damaged teeth) were recorded. In addition, the periodontal screening index (PSI/grades 1–4) was diagnosed to assess the presence of periodontitis. Furthermore, xerostomia was documented using the LENT-SOMA scale (grades 1–4), and the oral cavity was examined and categorised according to candidiasis (grades 0–3). The RTOG/EORTC-Toxicity Criteria scale (grades 0–4) was used to categorise mucositis. Moreover, an examination of the oral cavity was conducted to identify potential issues such as pressure sores caused by dentures, herpes, oral inflammations and aphthae. The assessment encompassed an evaluation of oral hygiene, the appropriateness of dentures and the documentation of any aesthetic concerns. In the same session, the subjective self-assessment of quality of life was evaluated utilizing the established EORTC QLQ-C30 and the oral health-specific EORTC QLQ-OH15.

### The role of oral sequelae in health-related quality of life of cancer patients [^115YFAuh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing treatment for cancer often develop oral complications. These complications have an influence on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Patient reports on HRQOL have been found to follow the same pattern as reports of experiencing oral discomfort. HRQOL should be incorporated as an outcome variable into the evaluation of the role of oral hygiene and oral care for patients with cancer, and oral status should also be incorporated as a variable when evaluating care for patients with cancer.

### An expert opinion from the European college of gerodontology and the European geriatric medicine society: European policy recommendations on oral health in older adults [^114PHhC7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

This is an expert opinion paper on oral health policy recommendations for older adults in Europe, with particular focus on frail and care-dependent persons, that the European College of Gerodontology (ECG) and the European Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) Task and Finish Group on Gerodontology has developed. Oral health in older adults is often poor. Common oral diseases such as caries, periodontal disease, denture-related conditions, hyposalivation, and oral pre- and cancerous conditions may lead to tooth loss, pain, local and systemic infection, impaired oral function, and poor quality of life. Although the majority of oral diseases can be prevented or treated, oral problems in older adults remain prevalent and largely underdiagnosed, because frail persons often do not receive routine dental care, due to a number of barriers and misconceptions. These hindrances include person-related issues, lack of professional support, and lack of effective oral health policies. Three major areas for action are identified: education for healthcare providers, health policy action plans, and citizen empowerment and involvement. A list of defined competencies in geriatric oral health for non-dental healthcare providers is suggested, as well as an oral health promotion and disease prevention protocol for residents in institutional settings. Oral health assessment should be incorporated into general health assessments, oral health care should be integrated into public healthcare coverage, and access to dental care should be ensured.

### International field testing of the psychometric properties of an EORTC quality of life module for oral health: the EORTC QLQ-OH15 [^11324LuB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This international EORTC validation study (phase IV) is aimed at testing the psychometric properties of a quality of life (QoL) module related to oral health problems in cancer patients.

Methods

The phase III module comprised 17 items with four hypothesized multi-item scales and three single items. In phase IV, patients with mixed cancers, in different treatment phases from 10 countries completed the EORTC QLQ-C30, the QLQ-OH module, and a debriefing interview. The hypothesized structure was tested using combinations of classical test theory and item response theory, following EORTC guidelines. Test-retest assessments and responsiveness to change analysis (RCA) were performed after 2 weeks.

Results

Five hundred seventy-two patients (median age 60.3, 54% females) were analyzed. Completion took < 10 min for 84%, 40% expressed satisfaction that these issues were addressed. Analyses suggested a revision of the phase III hypothesized scale structure. Two items were deleted based on a high degree of item misfit, together with negative patient feedback. The remaining 15 items formed one eight-item scale named OH-QoL score, a two-item information scale, a two-item scale regarding dentures, and three single items (sticky saliva/mouth soreness/sensitivity to food/drink). Face and convergent validity and internal consistency were confirmed. Test-retest reliability (n = 60) was demonstrated as was RCA for patients undergoing chemotherapy (n = 117; p = 0.06). The resulting QLQ-OH15 discriminated between clinically distinct patient groups, e.g., low performance status vs. higher (p < 000.1), and head-and-neck cancer versus other cancers (p < 0.03).

Conclusion

The EORTC module QLQ-OH15 is a short, well-accepted assessment tool focusing on oral problems and QoL to improve clinical management.

### Phase III quality-of-life study results: impact on patients' quality of life to reducing xerostomia after radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer – RTOG 97–09 [^116ySFoW]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether prevention of hyposalivation after curative radiotherapy (RT) to the head and neck improves patients' quality of life (QOL).

Methods and Materials

Patients were to receive at least 50 Gy to 50% of the volume of the major salivary glands, provide unstimulated and stimulated saliva samples, and complete the University of Washington head-and-neck QOL tool before RT and 3 and 6 months after RT. Patients were randomized to receive pilocarpine 5 mg or placebo q.i.d.

Results

A total of 249 patients was randomized between March 1998 and January 2000. Of these, 214 were eligible for QOL analysis. Patients were evenly distributed between arms by race, gender, tobacco use, tumor site, T stage (50% T2-T3), and salivary function. A Karnofsky performance status of 90% was more common in the pilocarpine arm. Twenty percent of the patients on the pilocarpine arm and 29% of the patients on the placebo arm were taking nutritional supplements. The placebo arm patients had greater mouth pain and chewing difficulties. Compliance for the QOL tool at 3 and 6 months was 65% and 50%, respectively. Despite statistically significant (p = 0.047 and p = 0.049, respectively) preservation of salivary function in the pilocarpine arm, patients on the pilocarpine arm reported difficulties with swallowing (75%), activity (80%), hyposalivation (64%), and taste (81%). No difference was noted between arms at 3 months in mucositis scores, with both arms demonstrating increased requirement for oral nutrients.

Conclusion

Objective prevention of hyposalivation did not affect patients' assessment of salivary function or QOL because of the greater impact mucositis plays in QOL after RT.

Background

The study aims to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health parameters on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) and mental health in elderly urban residents of South-Western Poland.

Methods

The 500 residents of Wroclaw, aged 65 and older provided demographic and personal information as well as their medical history. A patient's oral condition were determined based on the clinical oral examination. Quality of Life was assessed using Euro-Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The association between exposure (socioeconomic status, general health and oral health) and outcome (HRQoL, OHRQoL and mental health variables) were analyzed with the use of four models: P – Poisson model, NB-Negative Binomial model, ZIP – Zero Inflated Poisson model, ZINB – Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model.

Results

The best model turned out to be the ZINB model, in which a negative binomial distribution in the count equation is assumed. In this model, only 13 independent variables had a significant effect on HRQoL, OHRQoL, and mental health. HRQoL assessed with the EQ-5D is significantly influenced by: living conditions 0.133 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.267, p = 0.049), income -0.348 (95%CI: -0.466, -0.230, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus 0.437 (95%CI: 0.250, 0.624, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction 0.454 (95% CI: 0.151, 0.757, p = 0.003), stroke 0.543 (95%CI: 0.094, 0.992, p = 0.018) and renal disease 0.466 (95% CI: 0.206, 0.726, p < 0.001). Factors negatively affecting OHRQOL are: the need for oral treatment 0.278 (95%CI: 0.104, 0.452, p = 0.002), the number of missing teeth 0.053 (95%CI: 0.039, 0.067, p < 0.001) and gender 0.271 (95%CI: 0.015, 0.527, p = 0.038) and age -0.025 (95%CI: -0.042, -0.008, p = 0.003). An important factor influencing the level of depression assessed by the PHQ-9 questionnaire may be the material condition -0.225 (95%CI: -0.349, -0.101, p < 0.001). It should be emphasized that living with other people may be a factor that significantly increases the probability of avoiding the occurrence of depression symptoms.

Conclusion

The study concerning elderly residents of the macroregion in Poland found the impact of socioeconomic, general health and oral health parameters on Health-Related Quality of Life, Oral Health-Related Quality of Life and mental health. Research on the quality of life of the elderly at the local level allowed to assess the factors linked to quality of life of older adults.

### Oral health-related quality of life of patients with oral chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1139Z835]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is one of the first studies that assessed OHRQoL of patients with oral cGVHD using the OHIP-14 questionnaire. Our results demonstrate that the OHRQoL was mostly negatively affected by complaints of oral pain and oral sensitivity and less by the severity of oral mucosal cGVHD. The OHRQoL was affected in particular by functional problems with oral mucosal tissue, the dentition or dentures, like oral pain, uncomfortable eating, or altered taste. Social aspects had less impact on the OHRQoL. A similar pattern was found in a recent systematic review of the OHRQoL in patients with hematological cancers. Functional complications impaired OHRQoL more severely than social aspects.

The OHIP-14 is an internationally validated and widely used questionnaire to assess the OHRQoL. The questionnaire is user friendly and is available in different languages. As a result, comparison is possible with other studies in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated questionnaire available specifically designed for evaluating the OHRQoL of patients with oral cGVHD. In our experience, most problems faced by these patients are covered by items from the OHIP-14. The OHIP questions provide a global overview of a person's perception of the social impact of their oral disorder(s) on their well-being, while at the same time different aspects of impact are addressed. However, designing a specific validated questionnaire for evaluating OHRQoL in patients with oral cGVHD could be considered.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^113V7Umb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Epidemiology — advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care: In a UK cohort of patients with advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care, 97.5% of patients had at least one oral symptom, and the mean number of oral symptoms was five (range 1–18). Reported symptom prevalences included "Coating of tongue" 117 (47.0%), "Denture fitting problems" 26 (10.0%), "Toothache/pain in teeth" 25 (10.0%), and "Bleeding from mouth" 19 (7.5%).

### The impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health on health-related quality of life, oral health-related quality of life and mental health among Polish older adults [^117DcHZ9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Research on the elderly population is not easy due to the diversity of this group in terms of age, health status, disability level, wealth level, family situation and living conditions. Studies are mainly hindered by problems with communication with participants, especially with the oldest ones, as well as the reluctance of individuals to participate in research. Angelini et al. noted that self-assessments in elderly people with health problems and physical limitations concerning their life satisfaction can be potential sources of scale biases due to the reduction of the level of life satisfaction as well as pessimistic bias in the reporting style of the respondents. Besides, several limitations have to be also taken into consideration in a discussion concerning the results of this study. Firstly, this study was conducted using a self-report questionnaire which could lead to identification bias. That is why the selection of adequate tools is so important. Only a validated and reliable questionnaire should be used. The Oral Health Impact Profile – OHIP Questionnaire, which had not been available in the Polish language before, was validated by us. The obtained data indicated the reliability and validity of the OHIP-14 tool for the assessment of the oral health-related quality of life in the Polish adult population. In our own study, results of the analysis concerning the OHIP-14, EQ-5D and PHQ-9 items indicate very good reliability. Secondly, the use of survey data did not allow explanation of the temporal relationships nor inferences on causality. Thirdly, when analysing the obtained results, it is essential to bear in mind a possible self-selection error of the study participants – those who joined the study were concerned about their dental problems or aware of such problems and looking for help. Moreover, some individuals may have refused to participate in this study due to their dental fear. Dental anxiety is more common in edentulous subjects than in the subjects who still have at least part of their natural dentition. Another interfering factor was related to the exclusion criteria. This study was limited by the exclusion of patients with concurrent systemic diseases in whom periodontal probing leading to transient bacteraemia might have posed a risk to their overall health. Transient bacteraemia may occur as the result of many dental procedures and it is well documented following periodontal probing i.a. in patients with periodontitis. Patients with untreated periodontitis are at greater risk of bacteremia due to periodontal probing than patients with chronic gingivitis. For individuals at risk of infective endocarditis, radiographic assessment prior to periodontal probing would be advisable to identify those with periodontitis so that appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis can be provided. Finally, the exclusion of patients with a mental disorder was probably another interfering factor. Several studies have shown that mental disorders have a significant association with non‐response and attrition. In psychiatric epidemiology, this issue is of crucial importance. High response rates tend to alleviate bias whereas low response rates make study validity questionable. The above-mentioned exclusion criterion involved many elderly patients.

### Quality of life, mucositis, and xerostomia from radiotherapy for head and neck cancers: a report from the NCIC CTG HN2 randomized trial of an antimicrobial lozenge to prevent mucositis [^113UqtuG]. Head & Neck (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group undertook a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of an oral antimicrobial versus placebo to prevent and treat mucositis. We present the quality of life (QOL) analysis for this trial.

Methods

One hundred thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned. QOL data were collected every 2 weeks before, during, and after radiotherapy. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and a Trial Specific Checklist (TSC) were used.

Results

The antimicrobial lozenge did not impact QOL. The principal acute side effect of radiotherapy is oral pain, affecting more than 90% of patients. Role function is impacted during treatment, and patients experience fatigue. Appetite was reported to markedly increase during radiotherapy. There was a dramatic and persistent increase in dry mouth.

Conclusions

This study highlights the benefits of combining the EORTC QLQ-30 with an "oral" TSC in a randomized controlled trial and provides valuable baseline data for their use with an objective mucositis scoring system.

### Oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients: comparison of the persian version of geriatric oral health assessment index and oral health impact profile: a descriptive-analytic study [^116Qe2wj]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

In this study to avoid possible misunderstanding of participants 5 choices of questionnaires were placed in two groups and total of the scores were termed SC (Simple Count) Score so that if a patient chose one of two choice of "always" and "often" in GOHAI questionnaire the score of that question would be zero and if patient chose one of three choices of "sometimes", "seldom" or "never" the score of that question would be "1". Therefore, total of GOHAI scores (SC-GOHAI) in this method would range from zero to 12. In this system a higher score would indicate a higher oral health-related quality of life. In the same context, in OHIP-14 if a patient selected two choices of "almost often" or "in the majority of cases" score of that question would be zero and if a patient selected three choices of "sometimes", "seldom" or "never" the score of the question would be "1" and finally total of OHIP-14 scores (SC-OHIP-14) in this method would range from zero to 14; a higher score would indicate a higher oral health-related quality of life.

### The impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health on health-related quality of life, oral health-related quality of life and mental health among Polish older adults [^117VTjrH]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral health parameters

The evaluation of oral health was conducted by two examiners (with the inter-examiner kappa coefficient of 0.874 and the intra-examiner kappa coefficient of 0.870). Coronal caries and root caries were evaluated according to the WHO criteria, DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) values and their components. The periodontal condition was assessed in individuals who had more than 2 natural teeth by measuring bleeding on probing (BoP) in 6 sites, gingival pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and tooth mobility according to the Miller index. A patient's treatment needs were determined based on the clinical oral examination and they were categorised on a 5-grade scale: no treatment need, preventive treatment, prompt treatment, immediate treatment, or referral.

Dental prosthetic status was assessed by taking into consideration both the number of functional tooth units (FTUs) of natural and artificial teeth on implant-supported fixed dentures (non-FTUs) and the information on whether the participants wore partial or complete removable dentures. Furthermore, oral dryness was examined according to the Challacombe scale (Clinical Oral Dryness Score – CODS). The level of oral dryness was categorised based on the number of symptoms observed as mild (1–3), moderate (4–6) or severe.

### Interventions for improving oral health in people after stroke [^11571UTE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

For people with physical, sensory and cognitive limitations due to stroke, the routine practice of oral health care (OHC) may become a challenge. Evidence-based supported oral care intervention is essential for this patient group.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of OHC interventions with usual care or other treatment options for ensuring oral health in people after a stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group and Cochrane Oral Health Group trials registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and six other databases in February 2019. We scanned reference lists from relevant papers and contacted authors and researchers in the field. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted other researchers. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated one or more interventions designed to improve the cleanliness and health of the mouth, tongue and teeth in people with a stroke who received assisted OHC led by healthcare staff. We included trials with a mixed population provided we could extract the stroke-specific data. The primary outcomes were dental plaque or denture plaque. Secondary outcomes included presence of oral disease, presence of related infection and oral opportunistic pathogens related to OHC and pneumonia, stroke survivor and providers' knowledge and attitudes to OHC, and patient satisfaction and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text articles according to prespecified selection criteria, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We sought clarification from investigators when required. Where suitable statistical data were available, we combined the selected outcome data in pooled meta-analyses. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Fifteen RCTs (22 randomised comparisons) involving 3631 participants with data for 1546 people with stroke met the selection criteria. OHC interventions compared with usual care Seven trials (2865 participants, with data for 903 participants with stroke, 1028 healthcare providers, 94 informal carers) investigated OHC interventions compared with usual care. Multi-component OHC interventions showed no evidence of a difference in the mean score (DMS) of dental plaque one month after the intervention was delivered (DMS -0.66, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.09; 2 trials, 83 participants; I² = 83%; P = 0.08; very low-quality evidence). Stroke survivors had less plaque on their dentures when staff had access to the multi-component OHC intervention (DMS -1.31, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.66; 1 trial, 38 participants; P < 0.0001; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in gingivitis (DMS -0.60, 95% CI -1.66 to 0.45; 2 trials, 83 participants; I² = 93%; P = 0.26: very low-quality evidence) or denture-induced stomatitis (DMS -0.33, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.26; 1 trial, 38 participants; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence) among participants receiving the multi-component OHC protocol compared with usual care one month after the intervention. There was no difference in the incidence of pneumonia in participants receiving a multi-component OHC intervention (99 participants; 5 incidents of pneumonia) compared with those receiving usual care (105 participants; 1 incident of pneumonia) (OR 4.17, CI 95% 0.82 to 21.11; 1 trial, 204 participants; P = 0.08; low-quality evidence). OHC training for stroke survivors and healthcare providers significantly improved their OHC knowledge at one month after training (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.35; 3 trials, 728 participants; I² = 94%; P = 0.03; very low-quality evidence). Pooled data one month after training also showed evidence of a difference between stroke survivor and providers' oral health attitudes (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54; 3 trials, 728 participants; I² = 65%; P = 0.06; very low-quality evidence). OHC interventions compared with placebo Three trials (394 participants, with data for 271 participants with stroke) compared an OHC intervention with placebo. There were no data for primary outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of pneumonia in participants receiving an OHC intervention compared with placebo (OR 0.39, CI 95% 0.14 to 1.09; 2 trials, 242 participants; I² = 42%; P = 0.07; low-quality evidence). However, decontamination gel reduced the incidence of pneumonia among the intervention group compared with placebo gel group (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; 1 trial, 203 participants; P = 0.028). There was no difference in the incidence of pneumonia in participants treated with povidone-iodine compared with a placebo (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.51; 1 trial, 39 participants; P = 0.77). One OHC intervention compared with another OHC intervention Twelve trials (372 participants with stroke) compared one OHC intervention with another OHC intervention. There was no difference in dental plaque scores between those participants that received an enhanced multi-component OHC intervention compared with conventional OHC interventions at three months (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.25; 1 trial, 61 participants; P = 0.78; low-quality evidence). There were no data for denture plaque.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting that OHC interventions can improve the cleanliness of patient's dentures and stroke survivor and providers' knowledge and attitudes. There is limited low-quality evidence that selective decontamination gel may be more beneficial than placebo at reducing the incidence of pneumonia. Improvements in the cleanliness of a patient's own teeth was limited. We judged the quality of the evidence included within meta-analyses to be low or very low quality, and this limits our confidence in the results. We still lack high-quality evidence of the optimal approach to providing OHC to people after stroke.

### Oral health-related quality of life among long-term head and neck cancer survivors: a multinational study [^115YnDp7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

OHRQoL results

Survivors in the surgery only group reported less sticky saliva (mean 21.6, 95% CI 14.6–28.6) than survivors in the other treatment groups in unadjusted analyses (Table 2). The difference between groups remained clinically significant after adjustment. However, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in multivariable analyses after adjustment for multiple testing. Survivors who had received surgery only reported less sensitiveness to food and drink (mean 14.9, 95% CI 6.2–23.6) and survivors treated with RT only reported more soreness in the mouth (mean 30.0, 95% CI 21.4–38.6), compared to the other treatment groups. Survivors who had received RT only, reported most problems with ill-fitting dentures (mean 10.3 95% CI −6.5–27.0).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^11557HPv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancer quality-of-life and symptom assessment — patient-completed scales should be used to measure QOL, with three validated and accepted measures for H&N cancer-specific issues: the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (EORTC-QLQ-H&N35), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT-H&N) scale. The Performance Status Scale is a clinician-rated performance scale that is widely used for patients with H&N cancers. The Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire HN (OMWQ-HN) is a validated patient-reported instrument that measures the symptoms of oral mucositis, including mouth and throat pain, and its impact on well-being and function. Use of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events is encouraged for evaluating symptomatic toxicity in cancer clinical trials.

### Oral health-related quality of life among long-term head and neck cancer survivors: a multinational study [^1161fizg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Although we did not find a difference in OHRQoL between treatment groups, survivors in the surgery alone group reported less sticky saliva, reduced sensitivity to food and drink and fewer problems with ill-fitting dentures. Similar findings have previously been reported in a Swedish/Norwegian population of oral cancer survivors five years after treatment.

The survivors who reported poor OHRQoL had a high prevalence of dysphagia, trismus, osteonecrosis of the jaw, oral pain and dry mouth. This is in line with a newly published study. A systematic review on long-term toxicity among HNC patients more than five years post-treatment found some evidence that survivors had long-term problems with dry mouth, dysphagia and hearing.

This study is strengthened by the large sample size and use of the well-established, validated EORTC QLQ-OH15 questionnaire to ascertain OHRQoL from a patient perspective. By incorporating perspectives from survivors across multiple countries, this study provides an international, comprehensive and relevant understanding of long-term OHRQoL in HNC survivors. There are several validated questionnaires to evaluate OHRQoL in this patient group. Previous studies have used EORTC QLQ-H&N35 which was designed to measure HRQoL among HNC patients. This may be due to lack of a specific tool to evaluate the OHRQOL in cancer patients until the more recently developed EORTC QLQ-OH15. EORTC QLQ-OH-15 was developed to measure OHRQoL primarily in general cancer groups but is also relevant to HNC patients and include important aspects on oral health and topics such as pain, sensitivity to food and drink, information received and use of dentures. Many studies have also evaluated OHRQoL with the Oral Impact on Daily Performances (OIDP) questionnaire and the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14). Deana and coworkers provided a systematic review evaluating OHRQoL instruments available for older adults and their findings supported using EORTC QLQ-OH15 as a specific instrument to assess OHRQoL in cancer patients.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^117FHDqb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Oral discomfort/pain — causes and management in advanced cancer prioritize addressing underlying etiologies and tailored analgesia. There are several potential causes of new onset oral discomfort/pain in patients with advanced cancer, including salivary gland hypofunction, mucosal conditions (i.e. infection/inflammation/ulceration), dental-related problems, denture-related problems, neurological conditions and pain referred from adjacent structures. Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. relining, adjusting, or replacing poorly fitting dentures (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Symptomatic management primarily involves pharmacological interventions, which may include both topical agents and systemic analgesics, and the optimal analgesic regimen depends on the aetiology of the pain (cancer-related, coexisting condition) and the pathophysiology of the pain (nociceptive, neuropathic).

### Oral function improvement through oral exercise: gender differences in community-dwelling older adults [^114U3JHP]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to female participants, male older participants showed decreased outcomes following the exercise intervention. This may be attributed to the higher average age of the male participants compared to the females. Finally, oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) scores indicated a trend toward improved quality of life post-intervention, though these changes were not statistically significant. This finding aligns with prior findings suggesting that oral exercise interventions can enhance quality of life related to oral health. The limitation of this study was the unequal distribution of male and female participants.

### Severe oral mucositis associated with cancer therapy: impact on oral functional status and quality of life [^113RnUkV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

This study determined the incidence of severe oral mucositis (OM), patients' self-reported moderate and severe oral symptoms, and change of quality of life (QoL), as well as examined whether OM severity and pain scores predicted the impairment of oral function and QoL.

Patients and Methods

A multicenter approach was used and 137 patients treated with stomatotoxic chemotherapy (45%), high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy with or without concomitant total body irradiation (12%), head and neck irradiation with or without concomitant chemotherapy (44%) completed the OM-specific QoL measure (OMQoL) once or twice weekly over a 4- or 10-week period, along with concurrent measures of OM using WHO Mucositis Grading System and oral symptoms using 10 cm visual analog scale.

Main Results

The incidence of severe OM was 50% (n = 68). About 77–80% of patients with severe OM reported moderate or severe mouth or throat pain, and 66–78% reported moderate or severe oral functional problems. The oral symptoms peak and area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores of patients with severe OM (peak 5.6 to 6.8; AUC 3.8 to 5.2) were significantly higher than those without OM and those with mild OM (p < 0.01). The OMQoL subscales peak and AUC scores of patients with severe OM (peak 47.9 to 62.1; AUC -40.1 to -25.8) were significantly lower than those without OM and those with mild OM (p < 0.01). Of those with severe OM, 88–94% had a drop in the OMQoL subscale scores to at least 10 points from the baseline. Pain resulting from OM, in particular throat pain, is most predictive of oral functional impairment (standardized β = 0.53–0.83).

Conclusions

Severe OM can cause profound pain and oral functional incapability and clinical significant impairment of QoL.

### Exploring the integration of dentistry within a multidisciplinary palliative care team: does bedside dental care improve quality of life and symptom burden in inpatient palliative care patients? [^111rYbUK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

During the study period, 153 patients were admitted to the palliative care ward. A total of 103 patients were identified as being eligible to participate in the study. Three of these patients died before the second interview. Consequently, data from 103 patients were available at time T0; T1 data were available for 100 patients. Demographic dad for patients is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of the study population (n = 103)

Of these 103 patients, 50 were women (48.5%). The median age was 74 years. The patients' underlying diseases were as follows: 74 patients had a solid malignancy with a primary tumour outside the head and neck (71.8%), 18 patients had a solid malignancy with a primary tumour in the head and neck (17.4%), 7 patients had a haematological neoplasia (6.7%), and 4 patients had other serious underlying diseases and no malignancy (3.8%).

Comorbidities were present in 97 (94.2%) patients; 17 (16.5%) patients were active smokers.

Ninety-eight (95.1%) patients were taking more than 5 medications per day. Twenty patients (19.4%) received radiotherapy to the head and neck, 52 patients (50.5%) received radiotherapy to the body, and 67 patients (65%) received chemotherapy. Bisphosphonates were also used in 20 patients (19.4%).

Oral examination at T0

At the time of the first oral examination, the median time since the last visit to a dentist was one year. Five patients (4,9%) had no oral abnormalities and a good oral hygiene. These patients visited the dentist regularly, had adequate dentures and had no other oral symptoms.

On average, patients had 14 natural teeth; 7 destroyed or missing teeth not replaced by dentures; and 7 replaced teeth, including dentures, implants and pontics. The following table lists all oral symptom burdens, interventions, and caregiver availability at T0 (Table 2).

Table 2
Oral symptom burden at T0

It should be emphasised that 84 patients (81.6%) had tartar, 50 patients (48.5%) had insufficient dentures and 98 patients (95.1%) had poor oral hygiene. In addition, 69 patients (67.7%) had inflammation in the oral cavity, and 21 patients (20.5%) had mobile teeth.

### Oral mucositis: a challenging complication of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiochemotherapy. part 2: diagnosis and management of mucositis [^113Z5HNp]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Oral mucositis is a common sequel of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiochemotherapy in patients with cancer or patients requiring hemopoietic stem cell transplants. Mucositis has a direct and significant impact on the duration of disease remission and cure rates, because it is a treatment-limiting toxicity. Mucositis also affects survival because of the risk of infection and has a significant impact on quality of life and cost of care.

Methods

This article reviews publications on the diagnosis and management of oral mucositis accessible from a MEDLINE search using as key words mucositis, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hemopoietic stem cell transplant, and oral.

Conclusions

Conventional care of patients with mucositis is currently essentially palliative, with good oral hygiene, narcotic analgesics, and topical palliative mouth rinses.

### Geriatric assessment and quality of life for 2 years in older patients with head and neck cancer [^116TV7nL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the location and toxicity of treatments, head and neck cancer (HNC) has a major impact on quality of life (QoL). Objective: to assess the effects of geriatric-assessment (GA)-driven interventions on QoL over 2years in older adults with HNC.EGeSOR was a randomized study of HNC patients aged ≥ 65, receiving a pretreatment GA, a geriatric intervention and follow-up (intervention) or standard of care (control). The primary endpoint was QoL score using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer's (EORTC QLQ-C30) and HNC (QLQ-HN35) QoL questionnaires over 24months. In total, 475 patients were included (median age: 75.3; women: 31%; oral cancer: 44%). QoL scores improved over 24months with various trajectories, without significant differences between the groups. A total of 74% of patients (interventional group) did not receive the complete intervention. Cancer characteristics, functional status, and risk of frailty were associated with change in the Global Health Status QoL score. There is a need to develop an alternative model of implementation such as patient-centered health-care pathways.

### Oral health-related quality of life among long-term head and neck cancer survivors: a multinational study [^113FeSqB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a diverse group of malignancies and is the seventh most frequent cancer worldwide. Approximately 932,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2020, and in the same year HNC was responsible for around 467,000 deaths. Overall, the five-year survival is 66% for the total group and has increased over the last decade, in particular for patients with loco-regional disease. Both the disease and treatment have significant impact on survivors' lives causing decreased functioning and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL is defined as a subjective and multidimensional concept of how disease and treatment affect a patient's physical, emotional and social well-being (Quality of Life | EORTC – Quality of Life). Even though the awareness and interest for oral health in cancer survivors are increasing, previous studies report lack of knowledge on oral late effects after cancer treatment. Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) refers to the impact of oral symptoms and complaints on an individual's general well-being and daily functioning. More knowledge is needed about oral late effects in long-term HNC survivors, and on how these late effects may impact their OHRQoL. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are suitable for collecting information about patients' experiences of symptoms, functioning and other aspects of HRQoL. Such information can be used to inform clinical practice. Use of PROMs to measure OHRQoL as a routine in clinical practice may have advantages in HNC patients, such as monitoring symptoms, assessing functional outcomes and evaluating treatment efficacy, leading to more informed clinical decisions and patient focused care.

Weight loss and nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) in advanced cancer are described as follows: Weight loss is "a common problem in patients with advanced cancer (33–93%)", and "CAN should never be initiated solely on the basis of the development of weight loss". NIS are defined as "a range of symptoms/ problems that interfere with the patient's appetite, their ability to ingest food, or their ability to digest food", with examples including "dry mouth, taste disturbance, oral discomfort, dental/denture problems, difficulty swallowing".

### Quality of life changes over time and predictors in a large head and neck patients' cohort: secondary analysis from an Italian multi-center longitudinal, prospective, observational study-a study of the Italian association of radiotherapy and clinical oncology (AIRO) head and neck working group [^1111z8Nh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck carcinoma (HNC) is becoming common worldwide, and it is anticipated to rise by 30% accounting for an estimated 1.08 million new cancer cases annually by 2030. In particular, the increasing rates of human papilloma virus (HPV)-related tumors, with better prognosis compared to the counterpart, have contributed to this high prevalence of HNC especially in the United States of America and Western Europe. Currently, regardless of HPV status, evidenced-based treatments are multimodal and may produce several physical complications and psychological distress, which may persist beyond treatment. The main treatment-related side effects are oral mucositis, taste impairment, salivary gland dysfunction, xerostomia, incapacity to chew and swallow, bacterial and fungal infections, neuropathy, trismus, and skin changes and reactions of the treated area. All these complications impair patients' ability to perform on daily activities, resulting in social withdrawal, mental, and emotional distress and impacting patients' health-related (HR) quality of life (QoL) domains but also more general QoL domains. HRQoL may be described as a subjective and multi-dimensional concept related to one's perception of well-being and satisfaction with one's own health as well daily life functioning, which encompasses physical, psychological, and social functioning and disease-treatment related symptoms and side effects. Thus, it may be considered a subset of the broader concept of QoL, defined as "an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns". Accordingly, we have decided to focus on the more comprehensive term of QoL.

### Oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients: comparison of the persian version of geriatric oral health assessment index and oral health impact profile: a descriptive-analytic study [^116ybQrX]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have shown that diabetes is one of endocrine diseases that influence oral health of patients. Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic condition, which is associated with disturbances in metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Its prevalence is increasing in different parts of the world and mortality resulting from this condition is due to disturbances in function of vascular system (specially microangiopathy) and a deficiency of renal function. Type II diabetes mellitus is the most common type of diabetes, afflicting 95% of individuals with diabetes. Changing of normal oral flora and increasing odds of infection are the results of hyperglycemia and disturbances in healing processes of injured mucous membranes due to hyposalivation, changes in salivary chemical composition, decreased immune function and changes in diet. Oral problems of diabetic patients are xerostomia and subsequent problems such as increased accumulation of plaque and calculi, candidiasis, periodontitis, periapical abscess and burning mouth syndrome, which can influence quality of life of these patients.

A large number of studies have shown that oral conditions affect economic, social and mental status of an individual. Problem such as xerostomia, edentulism, soft tissue lesions and ill-fitting prosthetic appliances influence eating habits, speech, deglutition and type of food consumed by patients and generally systemic health of patients and at the same time influence the quality of life of patients. In addition, a large number of studies have shown that oral health and general health cannot be separated from each other. Questionnaires are useful tools to evaluate oral health-related quality of life. In this study Persian versions of GOHAI (GOHAI-Per) and OHIP-14 (OHIP-14-Per) were used to evaluate oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). In order to select a suitable tool for evaluation of OHRQoL its discriminant analysis properties should be determined initially. Capability of questionnaires to describe OHRQoL is varied in different countries. Based on assessments made in developed countries discriminant analysis capabilities of two questionnaires are different and GOHAI has a stronger correlation with function and masticatory ability; however, OHIP-14 can predict depression. In this context, no comparisons have been made between these two questionnaires in Persian-speaking countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the oral health of diabetic patients and their oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Also through this study psychometric properties and discriminant analysis potential of two questionnaires were compared in patient with different oral health statuses and other diabetes-dependent conditions.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^115huz2z]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Assessment of oral problems in advanced cancer — patients with advanced cancer should be regularly assessed for oral problems (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V), with assessment primarily involving a focussed history and systematic oral examination, sometimes requiring confirmatory diagnostic investigations; older generic oral assessment tools are not appropriate/validated in this population, whereas an oral symptom assessment tool has been developed/validated and newer generic tools may have a role; patients should be questioned about common oral symptoms and examined for oral conditions even when asymptomatic; a good direct light source is essential, gloves must be worn, a gloved finger or a "tongue depressor"/similar implement used to retract tissues, and dentures removed with stability and related problems checked; the assessment of oral problems should be the responsibility of all involved healthcare professionals, and patients with complex or dentition-, periodontal tissue-, or dental prosthesis–related problems should be referred in a timely manner to relevant dental professionals for specialist treatment.

### Oral health-related quality of life in adult patients with end-stage kidney diseases undergoing renal replacement therapy-a systematic review [^114P4NEU]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal disorders represent a global burden, whereby more than two million people in the world are treated for end-stage renal diseases. These diseases often require renal replacement therapy (RRT), of which haemodialysis (HD) represents the most commonly used measure. Recently, the incidence of RRT has decreased slightly, while patient survival has improved continuously. The improvements in therapeutic measures during RRT and the decrease in mortality might lead to a change in the major challenge of care for these patients; thus, patient-related outcomes such as improving patients' well-being and quality of life are of increasing importance. It is known that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is often reduced by RRT, especially for HD.

HRQoL is complex and affected by different factors, including oral conditions such as tooth loss, dental caries and periodontitis. Therefore, a specific part of HRQoL with respect to the oral cavity is defined: the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). This OHRQoL is a multidimensional model that provides information of the subjectively perceived influence of oral health conditions on patients' oral function, pain, psychosocial impact and orofacial appearance. OHRQoL is of clinical relevance for patients with RRT for two major reasons. On the one hand, patients with end-stage renal diseases, especially those receiving HD on a regular basis, suffer from an insufficient oral health status and oral behaviour. Potential associations between renal insufficiency and HD with periodontal diseases have been reported. Moreover, early tooth loss is observed, especially in patients undergoing HD. Accordingly, a reduced OHRQoL caused by this increased prevalence of oral diseases is conceivable.

### An umbrella review of the evidence linking oral health and systemic noncommunicable diseases [^115yT2zT]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Overall, 855 meta-analytic comparisons were included. More than half meta-analyses (n = 448; 52.4%) used a continuous exposure contrast, whereas the remaining used a binary analysis (Supplementary Data 2). Mean Difference (31.9%, n = 273), Odds Ratio (28.3%, n = 242), Risk Ratio (16.0%, n = 137) and Standardized Mean Difference (14.5%, n = 124) were the most common reported effect measures (Supplementary Data 2). Out of the 293 studies, 69.2% (n = 203) were published between 2011 and 2020, while 26.3% (n = 77) were published in 2021 and 2022, and 4.8% (n = 14) until 2010. About 24.5% (n = 72) had a search period limit of 2020 to 2022. Most meta-analyses used oral diseases and/or treatments as an exposure (n = 485, 56.7%), while the remaining used them as an outcome. The summary descriptive characteristics of the included meta-analyses by oral condition is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Descriptive statistics and evidence grading of the included meta-analyses of oral conditions

a This group includes results from denture stomatitis, mouth breathing, salivary conditions and salivary flow rate.

Summary effects and heterogeneity between studies

Of the 855 meta-analytic comparisons, 592 (69.2%) were nominally significant (p < 0.05), with only 7.7% of strong meta-analytical evidence (n = 66), while 18.4% (n = 157) and 6.4% (n = 55) were of highly suggestive and suggestive evidence, respectively (Table 1). Of the stricter P -value threshold, 355 (41.5%) and 120 (14.0%) meta-analyses had significance at 10 −6 and 10 −3, respectively. Approximately 62.5% (n = 534) of the included meta-analyses had high heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%), with 27.7% (n = 237) of them presenting low heterogeneity (I 2 ≤ 25%).

### Oral health-related quality of life among long-term head and neck cancer survivors: a multinational study [^115YdySd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Questionnaires

Participants completed the validated EORTC quality of life core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 V3) and the oral health module (EORTC QLQ-OH15) in their own mother tongue before they attended a clinical examination at the hospital. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific 30-item HRQoL questionnaire that consists of five functional scales, nine symptom scales and one global quality of life scale. The EORTC QLQ-OH15 is a 15-item module focusing on OHRQoL in cancer patients. It comprises an eight-item scale named OH-QoL, in addition to seven single-items focusing on problems with dentures, sore mouth, sticky saliva, sensitivity to food and drink and satisfaction with information received.

Both questionnaires use a 4-point Likert scale with response categories from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much". The responses are linearly transformed to a score between 0–100 for each scale. For functional scales in the EORTC QLQ-C30, higher scores indicate better functioning. In the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-OH15 symptom scales, higher scores indicate more problems. In the EORTC QLQ-OH15, higher OH-QoL scale scores indicate better oral health while higher scores on the information scale indicate more satisfaction with information received.

### Oral status of older people in medium to long-stay health and social care setting: a systematic review [^117Rn3V4]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The oral health of older patients aged over 65 years, whether hospitalized for long periods of time or living in institutions, is deficient, and a homogeneity in methodology of studies are needed. Furthermore, theoretical and practical continuous training courses would be necessary with the aim of training caregivers in oral health techniques.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^112Y51PW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral discomfort/pain

Aetiology

There are several potential causes of new onset oral discomfort/pain in patients with advanced cancer, including salivary gland hypofunction, mucosal conditions (i.e. infection/inflammation/ulceration), dental-related problems, denture-related problems, neurological conditions and pain referred from adjacent structures.

Management

Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. relining, adjusting, or replacing poorly fitting dentures (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Symptomatic management primarily involves pharmacological interventions, which may include both topical agents and systemic analgesics. The optimal analgesic regimen depends on the aetiology of the pain (cancer-related, coexisting condition), the pathophysiology of the pain (nociceptive, neuropathic) and a variety of patient-related factors (e.g. co-morbidities, personal preference) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

Bland rinses (e.g. normal saline) can often provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, including patients with oral mucositis. Similarly, "coating" agents can provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, particularly in patients with pain on eating/drinking ("contact"/incident pain). However, many patients with oral ulceration have associated inflammation, and so merely covering the ulcer(s) does not relieve the discomfort. Topical analgesics can be highly effective in some cases, and options include benzydamine hydrochloride solution/spray (anti-inflammatory), oral morphine solution (opioid) and doxepin solution (antidepressant). Topical analgesics are less likely to cause systemic adverse effects, and so are often considered as first line treatments. Local anaesthetics have a limited role, and care must be taken to prevent inadvertent aspiration. Equally, topical steroids have a limited role (e.g. recurrent aphthous stomatitis), and care must be taken to exclude oral problems that might worsen with steroids (e.g. oral infections).

Systemic analgesics can also be effective, but there are limited reasons for chronic administration (due to concerns about adverse effects).

Interventional techniques are another option in highly select cohorts of patients (e.g. patients with intraoral tumours).

### Oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients: comparison of the persian version of geriatric oral health assessment index and oral health impact profile: a descriptive-analytic study [^114ki4Wq]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Scoring of GOHAI and OHIP-14 questionnaires

Reproducibility and reliability of GOHAI-Per has been confirmed. It consists of 12 questions with 5 choices, which are answered by patients. Each answer has its own score: Never = 1; Seldom = 2; Sometimes = 3; Often = 4; Always = 5.

Questions of these questionnaires were assessed oral problems during the past 3 months and three dimensions of OHRQoL (physical function, pain and discomfort and psychosocial function). All questions have negative connotations despite questions 3, 5 and 7. So except the answer of questions 3, 5 and 7, answers of other questions were reversed to achieved highest scores for good oral conditions. Total of GOHAI scores was termed ADD-GOHAI (Score of GOHAI), which had a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 60, in which a higher score indicated a higher oral health-related quality of life.

Other questionnaire which was completed by subjects was OHIP-14-Per. It consisted of 14 questions with 5 choices and each choice had its specific score: Never = 1; Seldom = 2; Sometimes = 3; Almost often = 4; In the majority of cases = 5.

In this questionnaire all questions have a negative connotation and covers seven dimensions of OHRQoL (functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap). So the answers of all questions were reversed to achieved highest scores for good oral conditions. Total of OHIP-14 scores was termed ADD-OHIP-14 (Additive Score of OHIP-14), which had a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 70, in which a higher score indicated a higher oral health-related quality of life.

### Clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with oral health-related quality of life in survivors of head and neck cancer [^1133mKYG]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Factors related to head and neck cancer and the treatment of the disease can affect quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with the severity of impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in survivors of head and neck cancer using a multivariate analysis.

Methods

This cross-sectional study evaluated 90 volunteers who had completed radiotherapy at least 3months earlier. OHRQoL was assessed using oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) and the data were analyzed using robust variance poisson regression models.

Results

The mean total OHIP-14 score was 23.98 ± 12.55. Patients with hyposalivation had 56% higher (worse) mean OHIP-14 total scores (CI:1.11–2.18) and patients with advanced stage tumors had 31% higher mean OHIP-14 total scores (CI:1.03–1.66) in multivariate analyses.

Conclusion

OHRQoL of survivors of head and neck cancer experienced a negative impact following radiotherapy. The impact was associated with hyposalivation and advanced stage tumors.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^113SAQA2]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition characterized by burning of the oral mucosa, with or without dysgeusia and xerostomia, in the setting of no underlying systemic disease or identifiable abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing. BMS disproportionately affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is unknown; no single treatment has proven universally successful. In light of these shortcomings, having a practical approach to the evaluation and management of patients with BMS can improve both patient quality of life and physician satisfaction.

### Final-impression techniques and materials for making complete and removable partial dentures [^115ig382]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Edentulism is relatively common and is often treated with the provision of complete or partial removable dentures. Clinicians make final impressions of complete dentures (CD) and removable partial dentures (RPD) using different techniques and materials. Applying the correct impression technique and material, based on an individual's oral condition, improves the quality of the prosthesis, which may improve quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different final-impression techniques and materials used to make complete dentures, for retention, stability, comfort, and quality of life in completely edentulous people. To assess the effects of different final-impression techniques and materials used to make removable partial dentures, for stability, comfort, overextension, and quality of life in partially edentulous people.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 22 November 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Register of Studies, to 22 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 November 2017), and Embase Ovid (21 December 2015 to 22 November 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases, however the search of Embase was restricted by date due to the Cochrane Centralised Search Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different final-impression techniques and materials for treating people with complete dentures (CD) and removable partial dentures (RPD). For CD, we included trials that compared different materials or different techniques or both. In RPD for tooth-supported conditions, we included trials comparing the same material and different techniques, or different materials and the same technique. In tooth- and tissue-supported RPD, we included trials comparing the same material and different dual-impression techniques, and different materials with different dual-impression techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently, and in duplicate, screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for each included trial. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the random-effects model. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables for the main comparisons and outcomes (participant-reported oral health-related quality of life, quality of the denture, and denture border adjustments).

Main Results

We included nine studies in this review. Eight studies involved 485 participants with CD. We assessed six of the studies to be at high risk of bias, and two to be at low risk of bias. We judged one study on RPD with 72 randomised participants to be at high risk of bias. Overall, the quality of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was either low or very low, therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, as future research is likely to change the findings. Complete denturesTwo studies compared the same material and different techniques (one study contributed data to a secondary outcome only); two studies compared the same technique and different materials; and four studies compared different materials and techniques. One study (10 participants) evaluated two stage-two step, Biofunctional Prosthetic system (BPS) using additional silicone elastomer compared to conventional methods, and found no evidence of a clear difference for oral health-related quality of life, or quality of the dentures (denture satisfaction). The study reported that BPS required fewer adjustments. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study (27 participants) compared selective pressure final-impression technique using wax versus polysulfide elastomeric (rubber) material. The study did not measure quality of life or dentures, and found no evidence of a clear difference between interventions in the need for adjustments (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.70). We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study compared two stage-two step final impression with alginate versus silicone elastomer. Oral health-related quality of life measured by the OHIP-EDENT seemed to be better with silicone (MD 7.20, 95% CI 2.71 to 11.69; 144 participants). The study found no clear differences in participant-reported quality of the denture (comfort) after a two-week 'confirmation' period, but reported that silicone was better for stability and chewing efficiency. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low. Three studies compared single-stage impressions with alginate versus two stage-two step with elastomer (silicone, polysulfide, or polyether) impressions. There was no evidence of a clear difference in the OHIP-EDENT at one month (MD 0.05, 95% CI -2.37 to 2.47; two studies, 98 participants). There was no evidence of a clear difference in participant-rated general satisfaction with dentures at six months (MD 0.00, 95% CI -8.23 to 8.23; one study, 105 participants). We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study compared single-stage alginate versus two stage-two step using zinc-oxide eugenol, and found no evidence of a clear difference in OHIP-EDENT (MD 0.50, 95% CI -2.67 to 3.67; 39 participants), or general satisfaction (RR 3.15, 95% CI 0.14 to 72.88; 39 participants) at six months. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Removable partial denturesOne study randomised 72 participants and compared altered-cast technique versus one-piece cast technique. The study did not measure quality of life, but reported that most participants were satisfied with the dentures and there was no evidence of any clear difference between groups for general satisfaction at one-year follow-up (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear difference in number of intaglio adjustments at one year (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.34) (very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude that there is no clear evidence that one technique or material has a substantial advantage over another for making complete dentures and removable partial dentures. Available evidence for the relative benefits of different denture fabrication techniques and final-impression materials is limited and is of low or very low quality. More high-quality RCTs are required.

### Decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes from individuals presenting Candida-associated denture stomatitis [^114KJD3j]. Cytokine (2016). Low credibility.

Candida-associated denture stomatitis (DS) is the most frequent lesion among denture wearers, especially the elderly. DS is strongly associated with Candida albicans, as well as local and systemic factors, such as impaired immune response. Monocytes are important in the protective immune response against the fungus by the production of cytokines that recruit and activate leukocytes. There are functional changes in these cells with age, and individual alterations involving monocyte response may predispose the host to developing infections by Candida spp. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the production of TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-1β, MCP-1 and IL-10 by monocytes from elderly denture wearers with/without DS and elderly or young non-denture wearers. We detected that monocytes from elderly denture wearers with Candida-related denture stomatitis produced lower levels of CXCL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1. This imbalance in cytokine levels was observed in spontaneous or LPS-stimulated production. Therefore, our data suggested that inherent aspects of the host, such as changes in cytokine production by monocytes, might be associated with the development and the persistence of DS irrespective of aging.

### Interventions for the management of oral ulcers in Behçet's disease [^112Z6egr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis that can affect multiple systems. Mucocutaneous involvement is common, as is the involvement of many other systems such as the central nervous system and skin. Behç̧et's disease can cause significant morbidity, such as loss of sight, and can be life threatening. The frequency of oral ulceration in Behçet's disease is thought to be 97% to 100%. The presence of mouth ulcers can cause difficulties in eating, drinking, and speaking leading to a reduction in quality of life. There is no cure for Behçet's disease and therefore treatment of the oral ulcers that are associated with Behçet's disease is palliative.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions on the pain, episode duration, and episode frequency of oral ulcers and on quality of life for patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)-type ulceration associated with Behçet's disease.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 4 October 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 4 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 4 October 2013); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 4 October 2013); and AMED via Ovid (1985 to 4 October 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health trials register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We contacted authors when necessary to obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at pre-specified oral outcome measures to assess the efficacy of interventions for mouth ulcers in Behçet's disease. The oral outcome measures included pain, episode duration, episode frequency, safety, and quality of life. Trials were not restricted by outcomes alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent data extraction and an assessment of risk of bias, independently by two review authors and using a pre-standardised data extraction form. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

A total of 15 trials (n = 888 randomised participants) were included, 13 were placebo controlled and three were head to head (two trials had more than two treatment arms). Eleven of the trials were conducted in Turkey, two in Japan, one in Iran and one in the UK. Most trials used the International Study Group criteria for Behçet's disease. Eleven different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories, topical and systemic. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. It was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low and there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any included intervention with regard to pain, episode duration, or episode frequency associated with oral ulcers, or safety of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the heterogeneity of trials including trial design, choice of intervention, choice and timing of outcome measures, it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. Several interventions show promise and future trials should be planned and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Whilst the primary aim of many trials for Behç̧et's disease is not necessarily reduction of oral ulceration, reporting of oral ulcers in these studies should be standardised and pre-specified in the methodology. The use of a core outcome set for oral ulcer trials would be beneficial.

### The role of prehabilitation in HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy [^113qPcER]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Radiotherapy (RT) is used in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with excellent effectiveness, but it is burdened by important side effects, which may negatively impact patients' quality of life (QoL). In particular when associated with chemotherapy (CT), that has a radiosensitising effect (and its own toxicities), it is responsible for several adverse events, causing social discomfort and lower QoL, in patients who are already experiencing several tumor-related discomforts. Prehabilitation is a healthcare intervention consisting of several specialist visits prior to the start of treatment, with the aim of improving the patient's health status, resolving symptoms that interfere with treatment and impact QoL, and finally to better avoid or overcome complications. Of all cancer patients, HNSCC patients are among those who could benefit most from prehabilitation, both because of the high number of symptoms and toxicities and their difficult management. Despite this and the emerging data, prehabilitation is not often considered for the majority of patients undergoing (C)RT. In this review, we tried to understand what are the main areas in which interventions can be made prior to the (C)RT start, the possible side effects of the treatment, the effectiveness in their prevention and management, and the impact that prehabilitation may have in adherence to therapy and on the principal survival outcomes, providing important guidance for the planning of future studies.

Evidences and Conclusions

Although there is no strong data evaluating multidisciplinary prehabilitation strategies, evidence shows that optimizing the patient's health status and preventing possible complications improve the QoL, reduce the incidence and severity of adverse events, and improve treatment adherence. While cardiology prehabilitation is of paramount importance for all patients undergoing concomitant CRT in the prevention of possible side effects, the remaining interventions are useful independently of the type of treatment proposed. Geriatricians have a key role in both elderly patients and younger patients characterized by many comorbidities to comprehensively assess health status and indicate which treatment may be the best in terms of risk/benefit ratio. Collaboration between nutritionists and phoniatrics, on the other hand, ensures adequate nutritional intake for the patient, where possible orally. This is because optimizing both body weight and muscle mass and qualities has been shown to impact key survival outcomes. Finally, HNSCC patients have the second highest suicide rate, and the disease has side effects such as pain, dysfiguration, and sialorrhea that can reduce the patient's social life and create shame and embarrassment: A psychological intake, in addition to the usefulness to the patient, can also provide current support to caregivers and family members. Therefore clinicians must define a personalized pathway for patients, considering the characteristics of the disease and the type of treatment proposed, to optimize health status and prevent possible side effects while also improving QoL and treatment adherence.

### Oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients: comparison of the persian version of geriatric oral health assessment index and oral health impact profile: a descriptive-analytic study [^112kRYTi]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is one of the systemic disease which is show important oral manifestation and influence oral health. This study describes how diabetes mellitus affects oral health and oral health-related quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral health and oral health-related quality of life of diabetic patients and compare the discriminative capability of Persian versions of two GOHAI and OHIP-14 questionnaires in these patients.

Methods

A total of 350 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus, referring to the Diabetes Clinic, were selected and data were collected by GOHAI and OHIP-14 questionnaires completed by patients and clinical examinations. Oral health parameters (CAL, BI, GI, PLI, DMFT and xerostomia) were measured, also concurrent validity and conformity of two questionnaires were assessed. In order to test Discriminant analysis capabilities of two questionnaires, ADD and SC scores of questionnaires were divided into two parts and a logistic regression model was designed, which included subjective and objective variables.

Results

Mean patients age was 55 years (with 75.4% female patients). The results showed that some oral conditions such as xerostomia, clinical attachment loss, number of missing teeth and plaque index were correlated to diabetes control level (HbA1c) and type of anti-diabetic medication. ADD and SC scores of two questionnaires were at high level. However, the effect of oral problems on decreasing OHRQoL was evident. Both questionnaires had acceptable concurrent validity and conformity. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between GOHAI and OHIP-14. OHIP-14 questionnaire had a higher discriminant analysis capability compared to GOHAI and better diagnosed patients who needed dental treatments: patients with higher GI, xerostomia and those wearing partial dentures.

Conclusion

Diabetic patients did not show acceptable oral health status and in some extent, oral problems affected oral health-related quality of life. Psychotherapy courses and solving oral problems of the patients can improve OHRQoL. OHIP-14 had higher discriminant analysis capability and was more effective in diagnosing oral problems.

### Self-perceived oral health in hemato-oncological patients and the relation to quality of life [^1151ySMk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the Netherlands, yearly more than 10,000 patients are newly diagnosed with hematologic malignancies, mostly in adult patients. While watchful waiting is applied in patients with slowly progressing malignancies, most patients with hematologic malignancies are treated with chemotherapy, often in combination with immunotherapy or radiotherapy. In selected high-risk diseases, patients undergo chemotherapy followed by an autologous (stem cells from the patient) or allogeneic (stem cells from a donor) stem cell transplantation (SCT). Autologous SCT can be administered in patients with multiple myeloma, (non)Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, while allogeneic SCT can be administered for acute leukemia, (non)Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Patients treated for hematologic malignancies may experience treatment-induced complications of the oral cavity and peri-oral tissues. Oral mucositis is one of the most frequent acute complications of treatment, affecting quality of life negatively. It is characterized by erythema, ulceration, pain, difficulty eating, and higher need for pain medication. Other acute complications of hemato-oncologic therapies include xerostomia (feeling of a dry mouth), hyposalivation (decreased saliva production), oral infections, and taste changes. In most cases, these complications resolve within weeks or months following the completion of chemotherapy, but may persist and become chronic in some patients.

All SCT patients may also experience late oral complications such as xerostomia, hyposalivation, higher caries activity, and taste changes, possibly leading to lower quality of life. Moreover, patients that received an allogeneic SCT may develop oral chronic graft-versus-host disease. These patients may suffer from oral mucosal pain and ulceration, mucosal sensitivity to certain foods and liquids, dry mouth, loss of taste, and more rarely from a decreased mouth opening. Patients with a history of oral chronic graft-versus-host disease are at increased risk for oral cancer. Salivary gland dysfunction leads to a higher risk of caries and fungal infection, as protective properties of saliva are less present in the oral cavity. Several drugs used in the treatment of hemato-oncologic patients cause dry mouth and thereby also contribute to this problem.

### Explaining time changes in oral health-related quality of life in england: a decomposition analysis [^112sdWMG]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral diseases are highly prevalent and impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). However, time changes in OHRQoL have been scarcely investigated in the current context of general improvement in clinical oral health. This study aims to examine changes in OHRQoL between 1998 and 2009 among adults in England, and to analyse the contribution of demographics, socioeconomic characteristics and clinical oral health measures.

Methods

Using data from two nationally representative surveys in England, we assessed changes in the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), in both the sample overall (n = 12027) and by quasi-cohorts. We calculated the prevalence and extent of oral impacts and summary OHIP-14 scores. An Oaxaca-Blinder type decomposition analysis was used to assess the contribution of demographics (age, gender, marital status), socioeconomic position (education, occupation) and clinical measures (presence of decay, number of missing teeth, having advanced periodontitis).

Results

There were significant improvements in OHRQoL, predominantly among those that experienced oral impacts occasionally, but no difference in the proportion with frequent oral impacts. The decomposition model showed that 43% (-4.07/-9.47) of the decrease in prevalence of oral impacts reported occasionally or more often was accounted by the model explanatory variables. Improvements in clinical oral health and the effect of ageing itself accounted for most of the explained change in OHRQoL, but the effect of these factors varied substantially across the lifecourse and quasi-cohorts.

Conclusions

These decomposition findings indicate that broader determinants could be primarily targeted to influence OHRQoL in different age groups or across different adult cohorts.

### Oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients: comparison of the persian version of geriatric oral health assessment index and oral health impact profile: a descriptive-analytic study [^112jnx4s]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

According to this study, although the diabetic patients had poor oral health, OHRQoL scores were high on both questionnaires. In fact, oral health does not very much affect oral health-related quality of life. In this context, oral health status affects psychological aspects of OHRQoL more than functional aspect. Psychotherapy courses and solving the oral problems of patients can improve OHRQoL. Besides, both GOHAI-Per and OHIP-14-Per questionnaires have proper psychometric properties and both are rather effective in determining oral health-related quality of life; however, OHIP-14-Per has a higher discriminant analysis ability. So results of present study can be used to determine oral indicators effective in oral health-related quality of life in future similar studies on OHRQoL in Iran. It is suggested compare discriminant analysis capabilities of GOHAI-Per and OHIP-14-Per.

### Correlation between nutritional status and oral health quality of life, self-efficacy of older inpatients and the influencing factors [^114s4jso]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nutritional status is closely related to the clinical outcome of older inpatients. In 2012, a study by the Chinese Medical Association found that about 50.1% of older inpatients had a nutritional risk, and 15.1% experienced malnutrition. Early detection of malnutrition and timely intervention can improve the health status of most of the elderly. Poor oral hygiene, dental caries, periodontal disease or inappropriate dentures are common oral problems among the elderly, and poor masticatory function and oral health are considered risk factors for malnutrition. Self-efficacy refers to the ability of patients to adopt corresponding healthcare behaviours in order to improve indicators and maintain proper health. Improving self-efficacy can effectively enhance oral healthcare awareness and promote good oral healthcare behaviours.

A multitude of physical, social, psychological and biological factors contribute to a person's nutritional health status. Almost all these factors are particularly pertinent among older adults. Factors such as poverty, oral health behaviour, poor oral hygiene, dental caries and periodontal disease can affect the general and oral health of a person. Previous studies showed that impaired dental status can cause dietary limitations through chewing difficulty, resulting in impaired nutritional status. Furthermore, some reports showed that self-efficacy also affects the nutritional behaviours of the elderly.

At present, studies pay more attention to oral health behaviour, oral health-related quality of life of the older or oral health self-efficacy of patients with diabetic periodontitis. There are few reports on the correlation between oral health quality of life and the nutritional status of older inpatients.

Therefore, this study intends to explore the correlation between nutritional status and oral health quality of life, self-efficacy of older inpatients and the related factors.

### Appetite, oral health and weight loss in community-dwelling older men: an observational study from the concord health and ageing in men project (CHAMP) [^117PcCPt]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides new epidemiological evidence supporting the association of oral health (represented by number of natural teeth present), appetite and weight loss in community dwelling older men in Australia. A number of previous publications have reported poor appetite as an important determinant of nutritional deficiency and of weight loss among older people. Poor oral health, including wearing dentures, poor dentition, and mouth dryness, are known to be associated with loss of appetite. These previous findings suggest that poor oral health might contribute to weight loss with poor appetite as a mediator. However, our study has shown that poor oral health is an independent risk factor for weight loss in older men.

Poor appetite is frequently observed in association with ageing. It is important to note that nearly 40% of our participants reported poor appetite. This prevalence is consistent with previous studies. We found that men with poorer appetite were more likely to wear dentures, have limited chewing capacity, have mouth dryness, and have lower self-evaluated oral health status. Dormenval et al. also reported that dry mouth is associated with wearing dentures, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and poorer appetite among hospitalized elderly patients in Switzerland. Kamel et al. examined an adult population in the United Kingdom, and found that dry mouth, or reduced salivary secretion was associated with poorer taste sensitivity and reduced health- related quality of life. Furthermore, Donini et al. examined hospitalized elderly in Italy, reporting that those with poor appetite had limited chewing capacity, swallowing difficulty, and reduced tasted sensitivity. All these reports are consistent with the findings from the present study. However, specific biological mechanisms behind these associations between appetite and oral health are not understood.

### Outcomes of the salivary-oral health impact profile (S-OHIP) for chronic salivary disorders [^116euYyB]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) is a previously validated, concise, patient-friendly questionnaire used to determine the impact of oral diseases on patient quality of life. The present study seeks to examine the outcomes of a modified Salivary-OHIP (S-OHIP) survey in patients with chronic salivary disorders.

Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort of 67 patients with chronic salivary disorders and a control group of 16 patients undergoing septoplasty were surveyed using the modified Salivary-OHIP (S-OHIP) before surgery and six weeks following operative intervention. Additional factors analyzed included age, gender, etiology of salivary disease, general quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L, and general salivary symptoms.

Results

There was no difference between treatment and control groups with respect to age or gender. There was a significant difference between the groups regarding change in S-OHIP scores before and after surgery (p < 0.01). Salivary patients had a significant decrease in S-OHIP scores indicating improved salivary quality of life (p < 0.01), with a mean decrease in score of 9.5. The control group showed no change in S-OHIP score (p = 0.47).

Conclusion

The S-OHIP allows for a specific, targeted survey of salivary symptoms and is a useful, patient-friendly tool to quantify symptomatic changes in patients with chronic salivary disorders.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^111Xao6N]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Xerostomia/hyposalivation in patients on immunotherapy: The subjective sensation of dry mouth is termed xerostomia and low salivary secretion is termed hyposalivation; principles from two OCSG clinical practice statements apply to immunotherapy-associated dry mouth. There is weak evidence that dry mouth due to immunotherapy may be reversed or relieved by withholding the offending agent and possibly initiating steroid therapy. Xerostomia may not be associated with objective signs, may reflect a sensory disturbance, and such patients may benefit from treatment for oral sensory disturbances. Xerostomia is a common irAE of cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and can significantly impair the patient's health-related quality of life.

### Oral health-related quality of life and malnutrition in patients treated for oral cancer [^114RGTVa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of OHRQoL

OHRQoL was assessed through two widely used relevant generic measures. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) comprises 14 items that explore seven dimensions of impact: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap. The participants respond to each item according to the frequency of the impact on a five-point Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 4): never, hardly ever, occasionally, fairly often, and very often. The simple count (OHIP-SC) scoring method was used where the dimensions and the total score were calculated by summing the number of impacts reported as occasionally, fairly often, or very often.

The Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) index assesses the impact of oral conditions on eight daily performances: eating, speaking, cleaning teeth, carrying out major work or role, social contact, relaxing/sleeping, smiling, and emotional state. It evaluates the frequency and the severity of these impacts through Likert scales. For each performance a score is calculated by multiplying the frequency and severity scores. The sum of these performances scores is divided by the maximum possible score and multiplied by 100 to give percentage overall score. In addition, the OIDP extent was calculated as the number of performances affected by impacts, ranging from 0 to 8.

For both the OHIP-14 and the OIDP, a higher score indicates worse OHRQoL. The recall period for both was changed from the usual 12 or 6 months to 1 month. As participants were interviewed at least 6 months after the end of their oral cancer treatment, we used a 1-month time reference in order to avoid including the acute period of recovery, in the cases of recent treatment.

### Factors associated with oral health-related quality of life in community-dwelling elderly persons with disabilities [^112YZjrx]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine, in community-dwelling elderly persons with disabilities, the association between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) as measured using the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and specific oral health, health, and disability status variables; life satisfaction; living alone; and low income.

Design

Observational cross-sectional.

Setting

A Medicare demonstration conducted in 19 counties in three states.

Participants

Six hundred forty-one disabled, cognitively intact, community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older.

Measurements

The subjects' OHRQOL was assessed using the OHIP-14, which was scored using three different methods. Data on oral health, health and functional status, life satisfaction, prior health services use, and sociodemographics were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires.

Results

The participants' mean age was 79.1, and they were dependent in an average of 1.8 activities of daily living (ADLs); 43.1% were edentulous, 77.4% wore a denture, 40.4% felt that they were currently in need of dental treatment, and 64.7% had not had a dental examination in the previous 6 months. Seven of the 16 variables of interest had significant bivariate relationships using three OHIP scoring methods. Logistic regression analysis found that poor OHRQOL was significantly associated with perceived need for dental treatment (odds ratio (OR) = 2.61), poor self-rated health (OR = 2.29), poor (OR = 2.00) and fair (OR = 1.73) mental health, fewer than 17 teeth (OR = 1.74), and relatively poor cognitive functioning (OR = 1.52).

Conclusion

OHRQOL is associated with some (perceived need for dental treatment, poor self-rated health, worse mental health, fewer teeth, and relatively poor cognitive status) but not all (e.g. ADL and instrumental ADL dependence) measures of oral health, health, and disability status and not with life satisfaction, living alone, or low income.

Prevalence, overall Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) score and extent of oral impacts in patients treated for oral cancer (n = 133)

In terms of the OHIP-14, 95.5% of patients reported problems occasionally, fairly often, or very often. In the last month, 16.6% of patients experienced one or two impacts, 23.3% three or four and 55.6% reported five or more impacts. Physical pain, functional limitation, and physical disability were the dimensions with the higher impact (Table 3).

Table 3

Patients with malnutrition or risk of malnutrition had worse OHRQoL than those with adequate nutrition; ß -coefficient = 12.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.03–19.42) with the OIDP and ß -coefficient = 2.86 (95% CI 1.44–4.28) with the OHIP-14 in the unadjusted models. In the adjusted models, the respective estimates were lower but still significant; ß -coefficient = 8.37 (95% CI 1.42–15.32) for the OIDP and ß -coefficient = 2.08 (95% CI 0.70–3.46) for the OHIP-14 (Table 4). The OHRQoL scores were significantly lower (better OHRQoL) among males, older patients, and those with more functional tooth units while patients that had undergone radiotherapy had significantly worse OHRQoL according to OHIP-14.

### Oral health-related quality of life in adult patients with end-stage kidney diseases undergoing renal replacement therapy-a systematic review [^114CCarL]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The oral health of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) is insufficient. Poor oral health and its components can affect the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of these patients. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the OHRQoL of adult patients under RRT.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using the terms: dialysis OR "renal disease" OR kidney OR "renal failure" OR "kidney transplantation" OR hemodialysis OR "peritoneal dialysis" OR "renal replacement therapy" AND "oral health-related quality of life", complemented by manual search. Clinical studies including adults (age ≥ 18years) that were published between 2009 and 2019 were included in qualitative analysis.

Results

Twelve out of 20 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. The majority (11/12 studies) included patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD), with a sample size between 47 and 512 participants. Two studies included patients after kidney transplantation. Only one-quarter of the investigations included a healthy control group. The overall OHRQoL was found to be reduced. The majority of studies found relationships between OHRQoL and different oral health parameters. Furthermore, several relationships between OHRQoL and general quality of life as well as disease related parameters including age, gender, diabetes, blood parameters and dialysis duration were found. OHRQoL subscales psychological/psychosocial impairment and pain were predominantly affected.

Conclusions

Patients under RRT suffer from a reduced OHRQoL, which is potentially influenced by oral health and disease related parameters. Interdisciplinary dental care is needed and should consider both physical and psychosocial issues.

### General health, healthcare costs and dental care use of elderly with a natural dentition, implant-retained overdenture or conventional denture: an 8-year cohort of Dutch elderly (aged 75 and over) [^1155gvkQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For decades, the prevalence of edentulism has declined: more and more elderly retain their natural dentition until advanced age. Among elderly ≥ 75 years old, the prevalence of edentulism in the United States decreased from 67.3% in 1957–1958 to 24.1% in 2009–2012. European countries showed a similar decrease. There are, however, large differences between countries, as well as differences between rural areas and cities. In Europe, the prevalence of edentulism among adults ≥ 65 years old ranges from 69% in Albania to 15% in Austria.

This decline of edentulism is primarily the result of improved dental care and the changing attitudes towards oral health and dental care over the last four decades. Previous studies have suggested that maintaining a natural dentition is beneficial. Cross-sectional studies have shown that elderly with a natural dentition have better general health. Elderly who retain their teeth until late in life have a higher quality of life and better oral function than edentulous elderly.

When elderly become edentulous and their masticatory function decreases, this often affects their diet. Hard, fibrous food that is difficult to masticate is replaced by softer food, often with higher levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. As a consequence, their nutritional status and subsequently their general health could be at risk, leading to a higher prevalence of obesity and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, elderly with good masticatory performance have higher scores on general cognition and verbal fluency than elderly with limited masticatory ability. Next, edentulousness can limit social interaction and lead to avoidance of social activities. Considering the above aspects, several researchers have suggested that edentulousness should be viewed as a disability and that it may even be a predictor of various health issues and shortened longevity.

Oral function in edentulous patients suffering from ill-fitting dentures and poor oral function can be regained by placing dental implants that retain an overdenture. Elderly with implant-retained overdentures (IODs) show significantly better scores on oral function, denture satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life than elderly with conventional dentures (CDs). This is the major reason that IODs are now considered as the first choice for treatment of edentulous patients with poor oral function.

### A prospective study on oral adverse effects in head and neck cancer patients submitted to a preventive oral care protocol [^1154fGKx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the occurrence and severity of oral complications, number of radiotherapy (RT) interruptions and quality of life (QoL) in a population of head and neck cancer patients receiving a preventive oral care program (POCP) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT).

Methods

Prospective cohort of 61 head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiochemotherapy were monitored and submitted to a POCP that included oral hygiene and plaque control, removal of infection foci, dental restorations, periodontal therapy, fluorotherapy, oral hydration, and denture removal at night, combined with daily PBMT. Outcomes included occurrence of adverse effects such as severity of oral mucositis (OM) and oral symptoms (pain, solid and fluid dysphagia, odynophagia, dysgeusia), quality of life impacts, and interruptions of radiotherapy (RT) due to symptoms. Disease-free and overall survival rates were evaluated.

Results

There was a significant improvement in oral health conditions between initial assessment and the two longitudinal assessments (p < 0.05), which indicates that the POCP was effective for plaque control and reduction of gingival inflammation. All participants were free of OM at the beginning of the RT regimen and only 45.9% after the 7th session, and few patients ranked the highest score of OM. For all symptoms related to OM, there was a progressive increase of severity until the 14th RT session, which remained stable until the completion of the RT regimen. The same effect was observed for the quality of life measures. Discontinued RT due to OM occurred in only three patients (5%), and the maximum duration was 10 days. The overall survival rate was 77% and disease-free survival was 73.8%. Lower survival time was observed for patients with no response to RT (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest a positive effect of an oral preventive care program for head and neck cancer patients submitted to RT. The PBMT associated with a rigorous POCP resulted in satisfactory control of oral adverse effects, reduction of quality of life impacts, and interruption of RT regimen due to severe OM.

### Age-related oral changes… [^111zsYLL]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Xerostomia Xerostomia, the subjective sensation of dry mouth caused by decreased saliva production, affects 29 to 57 percent of older persons. 13, 36 Saliva lubricates the oral cavity, prevents decay by promoting remineralization of teeth, and protects against fungal and bacterial infections. 34 In addition to dry mouth, clinical manifestations of xerostomia include a burning sensation, changes in taste, and difficulty with swallowing and speech. 13 Although salivary flow does not decrease with age alone, certain medications and illnesses increase the risk of xerostomia in older persons Table 3. 13,
37. Candidiasis Although it is estimated that Candida species are present in the normal oral flora of healthy adults, 40 certain conditions increase the risk of overgrowth in older persons. These conditions include the pathogenicity of individual Candida strains; local factors; and systemic factors. 15, 41–43. In patients who wear dentures, oral candidiasis may also lead to an erythematous lesion called denture stomatitis. Angular cheilitis is a manifestation of Candida albicans or Staphylococcus aureus infection.
