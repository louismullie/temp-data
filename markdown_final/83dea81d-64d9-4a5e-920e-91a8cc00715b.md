for whom is target ldl below 55

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patients should have an LDL-C target of less than 55 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which major guidelines explicitly endorse an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL. Then, I should verify the exact risk categories and clinical scenarios where this target applies. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and any controversies, including dissenting views. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer and note practical implementation considerations and exceptions where a lower target may be warranted even if the primary target is 55 mg/dL [^1147iChS] [^117J6cZm].

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchors. The 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidemia guidelines recommend an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for very high-risk patients, both in primary and secondary prevention, and also specify a more stringent goal of less than 40 mg/dL for those with recurrent events within 2 years on maximally tolerated therapy, which I should keep in mind as a related but distinct stratum [^1147iChS] [^113cdgW1]. I should also verify the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway, which operationalizes a threshold of LDL-C 55 mg/dL for very high-risk ASCVD and aligns with adding nonstatin therapy when this threshold is not met on high-intensity statins, effectively treating 55 mg/dL as a de facto target in practice for that group [^117J6cZm] [^113geprU]. Hold on, I should also check diabetes-specific guidance; the 2023 ESC diabetes guideline and the 2025 ADA Standards both recommend an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL for people with diabetes at very high cardiovascular risk, which reinforces the same numeric target in a high-risk diabetes subgroup [^114XUt5z] [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8].

> Now, I need to define who qualifies as "very high risk" so I don't overgeneralize. Very high risk includes patients with clinical ASCVD, those with ASCVD plus additional high-risk features, and certain high-risk primary prevention states such as familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD or with multiple major risk factors, as well as type 2 diabetes with multiple risk factors or end-organ damage; chronic kidney disease with advanced impairment is also considered very high risk in ESC/EAS framing, which supports the less than 55 mg/dL target in those contexts [^1147iChS] [^111TifyJ]. Wait, let me verify the diabetes nuance; ESC 2023 and ADA 2025 specify less than 55 mg/dL for T2DM at very high risk, whereas high-risk diabetes generally aims for less than 70 mg/dL, so I should not apply the 55 mg/dL target to all diabetes patients indiscriminately [^114XUt5z] [^115GfDUL].

> I will now examine the clinical scenarios where the less than 55 mg/dL target is most consistently applied. Secondary prevention after an acute coronary syndrome or with established ASCVD is a core domain, and ESC/EAS explicitly recommends initiating high-intensity statin early and intensifying to ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibitor if the less than 55 mg/dL goal is not achieved within 4–6 weeks, which operationalizes the target in routine care [^1118F4Jq] [^117T55DC]. Hold on, I should verify the diabetes subgroup again; for T2DM with ASCVD or multiple high-risk features, both ESC diabetes guidance and ADA Standards endorse less than 55 mg/dL, which is a clear, reproducible indication for this target in practice [^114XUt5z] [^115GfDUL]. I also need to check FH; patients with FH who have ASCVD or are otherwise at very high risk are advised to target less than 55 mg/dL, and even some very high-risk primary prevention FH patients may reasonably aim for this level, though the evidence base is relatively smaller in purely primary prevention FH cohorts [^113eVBYo] [^112XZmJJ] [^112LbeGs].

> But wait, what about the strength of evidence and any dissenting views. The ESC/EAS and ACC documents cite outcome benefits with progressively lower achieved LDL-C and no identified harm at very low levels, supporting the "lower is better" paradigm down to at least 55 mg/dL and often below, including data from PCSK9 and ezetimibe programs and meta-analyses showing event reduction without safety signals at very low LDL-C levels [^113DKmHK] [^112mFCb6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the IMPROVE-IT program directly proved a less than 55 mg/dL target; let me reconsider. The ACC ECDP notes that the 55 mg/dL threshold was the approximate level achieved in IMPROVE-IT, but that trial was not designed to test less than 55 mg/dL as a prespecified target, so I should be careful not to overstate causality even though the achieved-level analyses are consistent with benefit at very low LDL-C [^117J6cZm]. I should also acknowledge that some U.S. perspectives, including AACE 2025, suggest that while less than 70 mg/dL is well supported, evidence for routine less than 55 mg/dL targets is more limited and that routine application to all very high-risk patients may be overstated, which underscores the need to individualize and align with patient values and access considerations [^115nbB8d] [^115htaqc].

> Next, I should review implementation details so the target is actionable. All major pathways converge on starting with high-intensity statin, reassessing lipids in 4–6 weeks, adding ezetimibe if the less than 55 mg/dL goal is not met, and then adding a PCSK9 inhibitor if still not at goal, with consideration of bempedoic acid or inclisiran in selected cases; this stepwise approach is explicit in ESC/EAS and ACC ECDP and is echoed in diabetes standards, which helps standardize care across settings [^1118F4Jq] [^113geprU] [^115GfDUL]. Hold on, I should verify safety messaging; multiple analyses and trials have not shown increased adverse events at very low LDL-C levels, including down to approximately 15–30 mg/dL in genetic and therapeutic contexts, which supports intensification to reach less than 55 mg/dL when indicated without undue safety concern, though clinical judgment and monitoring remain essential [^113DKmHK] [^117J6cZm].

> Let me synthesize the final answer succinctly. The LDL-C target of less than 55 mg/dL is recommended for adults at very high cardiovascular risk, including those with clinical ASCVD (especially recent ACS), type 2 diabetes at very high risk, familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD or very high-risk features, and selected very high-risk primary prevention patients such as advanced CKD or FH with multiple major risk factors, with the most stringent less than 40 mg/dL goal reserved for patients with recurrent ASCVD events within 2 years despite maximally tolerated therapy; this is supported by ESC/EAS 2019, ACC ECDP 2022, ESC diabetes 2023, and ADA 2025, while acknowledging that some U.S. groups emphasize less than 70 mg/dL as the primary target and view less than 55 mg/dL as optional or with more limited incremental evidence in certain populations [^1147iChS] [^117J6cZm] [^114XUt5z] [^115GfDUL] [^115nbB8d].

The target LDL-C of < 55 mg/dL is for **very high-risk patients** [^1147iChS], including those with clinical ASCVD [^114jJwm2], recent acute coronary syndrome [^1118F4Jq], or familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD [^113eVBYo]. It also applies to patients with **type 2 diabetes at very high risk** [^114XUt5z] and to those with a second vascular event within 2 years while on maximal therapy [^notfound]. This target requires a **≥ 50% LDL-C reduction** from baseline [^1147iChS] and is supported by European guidelines [^1147iChS] and the 2022 ACC consensus [^117J6cZm]; US guidelines generally use a < 70 mg/dL threshold [^115toYX3] but accept < 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients [^113geprU].

---

## Patient populations targeted for LDL-C < 55 mg/dL

### Clinical ASCVD (secondary prevention)

- **Clinical ASCVD**: Coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease [^115DgqTb].
- **Recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past year [^notfound].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) with ASCVD**: Genetic dyslipidemia with established ASCVD [^113eVBYo].

---

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at very high cardiovascular risk

Patients with T2DM at **very high cardiovascular risk** — such as those with multiple risk factors, end-organ damage, or a history of cardiovascular events — should aim for LDL-C < 55 mg/dL [^114XUt5z] [^115GfDUL].

---

### Recurrent vascular events despite maximal therapy

Patients who experience a **second vascular event within 2 years** while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy should consider an LDL-C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) [^113cdgW1].

---

## Evidence supporting LDL-C < 55 mg/dL target

- **IMPROVE-IT trial**: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe achieved LDL-C < 55 mg/dL and reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [^113hLDng].
- **FOURIER trial**: PCSK9 inhibitor therapy achieved very low LDL-C levels (< 30 mg/dL) with significant cardiovascular risk reduction and no significant safety concerns [^113DKmHK].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent reductions in cardiovascular events with LDL-C lowering to < 55 mg/dL, with no increased risk of adverse events at very low LDL-C levels [^112mFCb6].

---

## Comparison with other LDL-C targets

| **Risk category** | **Ldl-c target (mg/dl)** | **Guideline** |
|-|-|-|
| Very high risk | < 55 | ESC/EAS 2019 [^1147iChS] |
| High risk | < 70 | ESC/EAS 2019 [^116GYDVx] |
| Moderate risk | < 100 | ESC/EAS 2019 [^113U5npo] |
| Low risk | < 116 | ESC/EAS 2019 [^116Bfjt6] |

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

- **High-intensity statin therapy**: First-line therapy to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^115vtFC5].
- **Combination therapy**: Add ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with statins alone [^113geprU].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess lipid levels 4–6 weeks after therapy initiation or adjustment [^117T55DC].

---

## Safety considerations

Safety considerations include the **absence of harm** — very low LDL-C levels (< 30 mg/dL) have not been associated with significant adverse effects in clinical trials [^113DKmHK] — and the **need for monitoring**, with regular assessment for potential side effects during intensive LDL-C lowering.

---

The target LDL-C of < 55 mg/dL is recommended for **very high-risk patients** [^1147iChS], including those with clinical ASCVD, recent ACS, FH with ASCVD, T2DM at very high risk, and recurrent vascular events. This target is supported by robust evidence and requires aggressive lipid-lowering strategies to achieve optimal cardiovascular outcomes.

Clinical considerations on lower LDL-C targets — prior guidance noted a goal of < 55 mg/dl for high-risk individuals, but evidence shows limited incremental benefit: in a double-blind randomized trial of 18 144 patients with recent acute coronary syndromes, simvastatin plus ezetimibe achieved LDL-C < 55 mg/dl and yielded a trivial decrease in MACE with hazard ratio 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.99) without differences in mortality or other cardiovascular outcomes; a meta-analysis found no statistically significant differences for mortality or cardiovascular outcomes between those achieving LDL-C < 55 mg/dl and those who did not; a 2019 meta-analysis of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies based on achieved LDL-C < 50 mg/dl reported no substantial clinical benefit in all-cause mortality, CV-related mortality, MI, or stroke; in summary, treatment goals of < 55 mg/dl do not appear to provide substantial additional clinical benefit.

### Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering in individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk: percent reduction or target level? [^116vs1RL]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations for blood cholesterol management differ across different guidelines.

Hypothesis

Lipid-lowering strategies based on low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) percent reduction or target concentration may have different effects on the expected cardiovascular benefit in intermediate-risk individuals.

Methods

We selected individuals between 40 and 75years of age with 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) between 5.0% and < 7.5% who underwent a routine health screening. For every subject, we simulated a strategy based on a 40% LDL-c reduction (S 40%) and another strategy based on achieving LDL-c target ≤ 100mg/dL (S target-100). The cardiovascular benefit was estimated assuming a 22% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events for each 39mg/dL of LDL-c lowered.

Results

The study comprised 1756 individuals (94% men, 52 ± 5years old). LDL-c and predicted 10-year ASCVD risk would be slightly lower in S 40% compared to S target-100. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 major cardiovascular event in 10years (NNT 10) would be 56 with S 40% and 66 with S target-100. S 40% would prevent more events in individuals with lower baseline LDL-c, whereas S target-100 would be more protective in those with higher LDL-c. A dual-target strategy (40% minimum LDL-c reduction and achievement of LDL-c ≤ 100mg/dL) would be associated with outcomes similar to those expected with the S 40% (NNT 10 = 55).

Conclusions

In an intermediate-risk population, cardiovascular benefit from LDL-c lowering may be optimized by tailoring the treatment according to the baseline LDL-c or by setting a dual-target strategy (fixed dose statin plus achievement of target LDL-c concentration).

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to target LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and LDL-C level of < 55 mg/dL or < 1.4 mmol/L both for primary
and secondary prevention in very high-risk patients.

### Treating to new targets (TNT) study: does lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below currently recommended guidelines yield incremental clinical benefit? [^1139zGou]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial is a parallel-group study that has randomized 10,003 patients from 14 countries to double-blind treatment with either atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg. During the double-blind period, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are expected to reach approximate mean values of 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L) for the low-dose atorvastatin group and 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) for the high-dose group. Randomized patients are expected to be followed for an average of 5 years. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. The large patient numbers in the TNT study and long follow-up should ensure that there is adequate power to definitively determine if reducing LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) can provide additional clinical benefit.

Introduction

All clinicians attest to the fact that guidelines, although helpful, do not match day-to-day practice. Many patients do not fit neatly into the categorised recommendations, and judgement must be made on the most prudent course of action. The recently updated guidelines for management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) present a further challenge since they recommend aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering: < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident ASCVD; and < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years. The ESC/EAS approach of recommending these very low goals for LDL-C is in distinction to the recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines where a threshold of 70 mg/dL was identified as a level at which addition of non-statin to maximally tolerated statin therapy could be considered, but no lower goal was set. The European guideline writers believe that the science is strong enough to state that 'no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined'. This approach prompts a number of questions — how do we translate this into clinical practice? Should it be applied universally or selectively? This review briefly lays out the evidence that led the writers to recommend the most aggressive goals yet for LDL-C lowering, and explores a case-based interpretation of the practicality of intensive LDL-C lowering.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113uwnEm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Desirable LDL-C targets for adults: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management should be individualized, and evidence supports an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL for healthy adults in the general population; individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with very high baseline LDL-C suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), multiple risk factors, or established ASCVD, may require lower LDL-C levels, and higher plaque burden or progression are situations where more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy should be considered.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117CYeQV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

AACE dyslipidemia risk assessment and LDL-C targets — For primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) recommends the use of a validated tool or calculator to predict future risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as part of shared decision-making and notes limited utility in broad application of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] measurements, though additional testing may be considered for intermediate-risk individuals; for those undergoing pharmacotherapy who have ASCVD or are at increased risk, AACE suggests for treatment to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, acknowledging that prior lower targets (< 55 mg/dL) were informed by a single ezetimibe trial and meta-analyses did not show differences in cardiovascular events or mortality.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^1161rx8r]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117J6cZm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, management, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to target LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and LDL-C level of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) in very high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD. Initiate a combination therapy if goals cannot be achieved.

### Combination therapy in dyslipidemia: where are we now? [^114YHkhW]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease: each 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C reduces the incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic stroke by approximately 20%. Statins are a well-established treatment option for dyslipidemia, with LDL-C reduction in the range of 27–55%. Several lipid goal-driven guidelines recommend reducing LDL-C to < 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or < 1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in very high-risk patients. Many patients treated with statins do not reach these goals, and remain at risk of future cardiovascular events. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines move away from advocating LDL-C treatment targets with focus placed on identifying patients most likely to benefit from high-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy. While increasing the statin dose can prove efficacious in some patients, this approach typically offers limited additional LDL-C lowering, and is associated with increased incidence of adverse side effects. Indeed, this has led to the investigation of statins in combination with other lipid-modifying agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This review of the evidence for statin use in combination with fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in dyslipidemic patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, explores the impact of such combination therapies on lipids, attainment of lipid targets, inflammatory markers, and on cardiovascular outcomes and pathology. Additionally, new and emerging dyslipidemia treatments are summarized.

Are Low Levels ofHarmful?

Observational studies have raised questions about the safety of low levels of LDL‐C achieved through intensive lipid lowering; however, there does not appear to be a "too low" level of LDL‐C. Populations with naturally occurring low levels of LDL‐C exist, and studies of individuals with genetic mutations leading to reduced LDL‐C levels reveal no safety issues and have shown an association with reduced ASCVD risk. This notion is recognized by the lower LDL‐C goals in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which recommend target LDL‐C levels as low as < 55 and < 40 mg/dL, the latter for patients who have had multiple ASCVD events within 2 years.

Achievement of very low LDL‐C levels in clinical trials of lipid‐lowering therapies has not been associated with an increased prevalence of adverse events. In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, 42% of patients achieved LDL‐C levels ≤ 25 mg/dL at 48 weeks with no significant difference between the evolocumab and placebo groups in terms of adverse events beyond injection‐site reactions. In a prespecified analysis of IMPROVE‐IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), patients who achieved very low LDL‐C levels (< 30 mg/dL) at 1 month after acute coronary syndrome had a similar safety profile over a period of 6 years compared with patients who achieved LDL‐C concentrations ≥ 30 mg/dL; furthermore, the very low LDL‐C group had the numerically lowest rate of cardiovascular events. In addition, the EBBINGHAUS (Evaluating PCSK9 Binding Antibody Influence on Cognitive Health in High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects) trial of patients who received evolocumab or placebo added to statins showed no significant between‐group difference in cognitive function, even among patients who achieved very low levels of LDL‐C (< 25 mg/dL).

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, treatment targets, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to target LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and the following LDL-C levels in patients with T2DM:

- < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) in very high-risk patients

- < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) in high-risk patients.

### Achievement of LDL-C [^111ruMYx]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Reflecting clinical trial data showing improved outcomes with lower LDL-C levels, guidelines across the globe are increasingly recommending a goal of LDL-C < 55 mg/dL in persons with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). What proportion of patients with ASCVD are already meeting those goals in the US remains understudied.

Methods

Using electronic health record data from 8 large US health systems, we evaluated lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), LDL-C levels, and factors associated with an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL in persons with ASCVD treated between 1/1/2021–12/31/2021. Multivariable modeling was used to evaluate factors associated with achievement of an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL.

Results

Among 167,899 eligible patients, 22.6% (38,016) had an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL. While 76.1% of individuals overall were on a statin, only 38.2% were on a high-intensity statin, 5.9% were on ezetimibe, and 1.7% were on a PCSK9i monoclonal antibody (mAb). Factors associated with lower likelihood of achieving an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL included: younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.91 per 10y), female sex (OR 0.69), Black race (OR 0.76), and noncoronary artery disease forms of ASCVD including peripheral artery disease (OR 0.72) and cerebrovascular disease (OR 0.85), while high-intensity statin use was associated with increased odds of LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (OR 1.55). Combination therapy (statin+ezetimibe or statin+PCSK9i mAb) was rare (4.4% and 0.5%, respectively) and was associated with higher odds of an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (OR 1.39 and 3.13, respectively).

Conclusion

Less than a quarter of US patients with ASCVD in community practice are already achieving an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL. Marked increases in utilization of both high intensity statins and combination therapy with non-statin therapy will be needed to achieve LDL-C levels < 55 mg/dL at the population level in secondary prevention.

International LDL-C targets and risk relationship — The risk of ASCVD events is directly proportional to the achieved LDL-C concentration, with benefit observed down to levels below 20 mg/dL, and international guidelines endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk populations; specifically, the European Atherosclerosis Society recommends an LDL-C goal of < 40 mg/dL for patients with recurrent events, while the Lipid Association of India advocates for a target < 30 mg/dL in individuals classified as extreme risk, and patient messaging emphasizes lipid-lowering therapy to reduce ASCVD risk because LDL-C is the building block for atheroma formation.

### Achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds in very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113CKP8H]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Nonstatin Therapies recommended more aggressive management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Guideline. In congruence with European guidelines, a target LDL-C threshold of 55 mg/dL is recommended for patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Real-world status of the early implementation of this recommendation remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine the proportion of patients with very high-risk ASCVD achieving an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL and characterize differences between patients who did and did not achieve this LDL-C value.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, who were ≥ 18 years old with very high-risk ASCVD from the University of Colorado Health system primary care practices. Very high-risk ASCVD was defined as a history of a major ASCVD event with at least 2 high-risk conditions.

Results

A total of 8974 patients met inclusion criteria for very high-risk ASCVD. Of these, only 21.0% achieved an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, while 39.5% of patients achieved the previously recommended LDL-C threshold of < 70 mg/dL. More than half of patients were prescribed a high-intensity statin-based regimen.

Conclusion

Within a large, academic health-system, achievement of LDL-C threshold among patients with very high-risk ASCVD was low. Recommendations from the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway that endorse more aggressive LDL-C lowering and emphasize nonstatin therapies as an adjunct to statins are not fully implemented in real-world clinical practice.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^111HmLvz]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### Discontinuation of lipid-modifying agents and failure to achieve target LDL cholesterol levels across cardiovascular risk groups [^113J9Lbn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

European and American risk-based LDL-C targets — thresholds and actions: According to the European Society of Cardiology guidance, individuals aged 50 to 69 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of ≥ 10% and those under 50 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 7.5% should aim to reduce their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to < 1.4 mmol/L (54.1 mg/dL). Individuals under 50 years with a CVD risk between 2.5% and 7.5% and those aged 50–69 years with a 10-year CVD risk between 5% and < 10% should target an LDL-C level of < 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL). In line with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidance, individuals aged 40–75 years with LDL-C levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL) are recommended to assess their 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; if the ASCVD risk is between 7.5% and 19%, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% to 49%, while an ASCVD risk ≥ 20% warrants a reduction of 50%. In Australia, individuals aged 45–79 years with a 5-year CVD risk of ≥ 5% are recommended to initiate LMAs to reduce their LDL-C levels to 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL).

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD, acute coronary syndrome, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain follow-up lipid levels in 4–6 weeks after acute coronary syndrome to determine if a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and goal levels of LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) have been achieved. Assess safety issues at this time and adapt statin doses accordingly.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

4.3 European perspectives

In patients after ACS, the guideline recommends starting high‐intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible, and regardless of initial LDL‐C values, to reach the goals for the very high‐risk group of ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). 16 Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL have been achieved. If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). 8 If the goal < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). 9, 15 For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL‐C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C). 2, 17

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^113A6taB]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In assessing progress towards goals, it should be noted that laboratory measurement of LDL-C at very low levels can present challenges especially when lipoprotein (a) or plasma triglyceride levels are elevated. In this context, secondary goals relating to non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B can be useful when judging whether to prescribe add-on therapy.

Figure 4 summarises the types of conditions that would lead to intensification of LDL-C-lowering therapy, that is, combination of statins with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors. Identification of an individual with elevated risk of ASCVD, based on risk factor screening and evaluation of their SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Estimation), or the presence of disorders that predispose to the development of ASCVD, such as type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, would place them in the 'high risk' category with goals of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and at least a 50% reduction from baseline. Among individuals with established ASCVD (on imaging or clinical presentation) and comorbidities (chronic kidney disease or history of diabetes with organ damage, proteinuria, hypertension), vascular imaging can aid in judging the most appropriate LDL-C goal. Where it is clear that a patient has atherosclerotic disease that is following an aggressive course, as indicated by serial events within 2 years, a goal of < 1.0 mmol/L is warranted.

Schematic showing rationale for intensive LDL-C lowering. The outer circle represents patients at 'high risk' with an LDL-C goal of below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Evidence of established disease, comorbidities, cardiometabolic disorders and multiple risk factors moves patients into the 'very high' risk middle circle, with a more ambitious target of below 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL). The most stringent goal of below 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) is recommended for those with a particularly aggressive disease course(see online supplemental figure 2 for the mg/dL (mmol/L) version).

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology on the management of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease algorithm-2020 executive summary [^111g27S2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

3 GOALS VS THRESHOLD FOR TREATMENT

3.1 General comments

For patients with ACS, the European guideline recommends a LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL and a LDL‐C reduction by 50% (class I) to guide therapy, whereas the American guideline recommends a high‐intensity statin to achieve a 50% reduction in LDL‐C and a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL for treatment intensification (Table 1). 1 The approach with goals aims to reduce risks by lowering LDL‐C to levels achieved in large clinical trials, whereas the approach with threshold aims to reduce risks by lowering further LDL‐C when the LDL‐C values are above criteria used in nonstatin trials. 1, 2 Threshold has been evaluated in many randomized clinical trials, with the baseline LDL‐C level predefined by the protocol inclusion criterion. Treatment goals have rarely been studied in randomized trials; therefore, the evidence is weaker and mostly based on postrandomization data (inference based on achieved LDL‐C levels by assigned treatment). The hazards of drawing medical decision from postrandomization data are still a matter of debate, although the data show consistent benefits of reducing LDL‐C below guideline recommendations. 13, 15

3.2 American perspectives

In secondary prevention of patients at very high‐risk for ASCVD, the initiation or continuation of high‐intensity statin is recommended to achieve an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50%. 1 If LDL‐C levels remain above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated therapy, the guideline recommends adding a nonstatin agent. If the LDL‐C is already < 70 mg/dL, the continuation of the maximally tolerated therapy is recommended with monitoring of LDL‐C. The concept of threshold utilizes an adaptive strategy (ie, addition of nonstatin agent) only if the treatment effect observed with a standard therapy is not satisfactory (eg, LDL‐C levels on maximally tolerated statin still above the threshold). Therefore, once the LDL‐C is below the threshold of 70 mg/dL, the exact value of LDL‐C does not influence further modification of LDL‐lowering therapy (eg, having a value of 30 mg/dL is managed the same as a value of 68 mg/dL).

### JCL roundtable: lipid treatment targets [^113u6dLJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

This Roundtable discussion concerns atherogenic risk markers and treatment targets used by clinical lipidologists in daily practice. Our purpose is to understand the risk marker framework that supports and enables the new ACC/AHA/Multisociety Cholesterol Guidelines. Some biomarkers are highly associated with atherogenic risk but fail to qualify as treatment targets. Prominent examples are high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, for which targeted treatment has failed to reduce cardiovascular risk, and lipoprotein(a), which currently lacks a highly effective mode of treatment. As a consequence, guidelines have focused consistently on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and more recently on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We discuss a new calculation for LDL-C that shows greater accuracy than the commonly performed Friedewald calculation. LDL-C treatment goals have renewed prominence in the 2018 Guidelines. Thresholds for treatment initiation or intensification inherently establish goals of reducing atherogenic cholesterol levels below the thresholds. Treatment goals may be absolute, such as less than 70 mg/dL for LDL-C in very high-risk secondary prevention or relative, such as 50% or greater reduction of LDL-C. The timeframe of treatment is another consideration because milder treatment started earlier may sometimes be preferred over stronger treatment given late in the course of atherosclerotic progression. Advanced lipid testing and vascular imaging, particularly coronary artery calcium, also have their place in risk assessment to guide clinical lipid practice.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^113ycEJA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Although treatment with statins is the predominant treatment for elevated LDL‐C, statin therapy does not allow some patients to achieve LDL‐C values of < 55 mg/dL, some patients may not tolerate statins at higher intensities, and there are a minority of others who are reportedly intolerant entirely, although recent data have highlighted an important role for the nocebo effect in patients with perceived adverse effects following statin therapy. In some patients, even high‐intensity statins alone may not be enough. Where required, statins can be supplemented by nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors, to further optimize LDL‐C reduction. Recent real‐world European data suggest that LDL‐C goals are rarely met among very high‐risk patients; only 18% (≈1 of 6) of very high‐risk patients achieved the 2019 European guideline LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), whereas 39% met the 2016 goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). A prospective observational study in the United States looking at treatment patterns over 2 years in patients with ASCVD identified that at 2 years of follow‐up 31.7% of patients overall had LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). The increased use of nonstatin agents in combination with statins may help higher‐risk patients meet the LDL‐C levels recommended by current guidelines.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^115LMT8P]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk thresholds — In the U.S., the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety Blood Cholesterol Guideline suggests LDL-C thresholds of 100 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL for consideration of intensification of therapy depending on ASCVD risk category, and the 2022 ACC ECDP for Use of Nonstatin Therapies recommend an LDL-C threshold of 55 mg/dL for patients at very high risk; although there are no RCTs that used LDL-C 55 mg/dL as a treatment threshold, it was the approximate level achieved in the IMPROVE-IT trial. Specific apoB thresholds have not been suggested in U.S. guidelines, but the treatment thresholds for apoB suggested in Table 4 can be employed by clinicians; additionally, an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL and an apoB level of 130 mg/dL correspond to approximately the 90th percentiles of the untreated adult population and are risk-enhancing factors that warrant a clinician-patient discussion regarding initiation or intensification of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT).

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk categories define lipid targets to guide therapy. High risk (< 10% 10-year risk) has goals LDL-C < 100 mg/dl, apo B < 90 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dl. Very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) targets LDL-C < 70 mg/dl, apo B < 80 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dl. Extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk) specifies LDL-C < 55 mg/dl, apo B < 70 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 90 mg/dl, with criteria including target organ damage such as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ABI < 0.9.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111TifyJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

ESC/EAS 2019 dyslipidemia guidelines — Very high total cardiovascular (CV) risk groups are defined as documented cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D), very high risk factor levels generating a 10-year cumulative risk score of > 10% for a first fatal CV event using SCORE, and chronic kidney disease (CKD); lower risks use SCORE thresholds of > 5% to 10% for high risk, 1% to 5% for moderate risk, and < 1% for low risk. Treatment goals by CV risk specify, for very high risk (secondary or primary prevention), an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) with a reduction of > 50% from baseline; for high risk, an LDL-C goal of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) with at least 50% reduction if baseline LDL-C is between 1.8 and 3.5 mmol/L (70 and 135 mg/dL); for moderate risk, LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); and for low risk, LDL-C < 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). For individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who have a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximal tolerated statin doses, the guidelines suggest consideration of an LDL-C goal of < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL).

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk". LDL levels are reported in mg/dL.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^112qfEdb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Although absolute risk varies as a spectrum among a group of individuals, the National Lipid Association (NLA) currently defines only two risk categories for patients with diabetes: very high risk and high risk. The very-high-risk category for diabetes includes not only secondary prevention patients (i.e. those with prior clinical ASCVD events) but also primary prevention patients with ≥ 2 other major risk factors: low HDL-C (< 40 mg/dL [< 1.04 mmol/L]), hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) or on antihypertensive medication, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in a male first-degree relative < 55 years of age or in a female first-degree relative < 65 years of age, age (men ≥ 45 years of age; women ≥ 55 years of age), or evidence of end-organ damage (albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g [> 3.39 mg/mmol], CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2], or retinopathy). The high-risk category for diabetes includes primary prevention patients (i.e. no recognized prior clinical ASCVD events) with ≤ 1 other major ASCVD risk factor and no evidence of end-organ damage. While not defining lower limits for atherogenic cholesterol goals, for very-high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B, have treatment goals of < 100 mg/dL [< 2.59 mmol/L], < 70 mg/dL [< 1.81 mmol/L], and < 80 mg/dL [< 0.80 g/L], respectively. For high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B have treatment goals of < 130 mg/dL [< 3.37 mmol/L], < 100 mg/dL [< 2.59 mmol/L], and < 90 mg/dL [< 0.90 g/L], respectively. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) currently also describes only two categories of risk for patients with diabetes. Targeted atherogenic cholesterol particle goals (i.e. non-HDL-C, LDL-C, apo B) are similar to those of the NLA, with the added targeted LDL-P goal of < 1000 nmol/L for very-high-risk and < 1200 nmol/L for high-risk patients, consistent with the population percentile cut-points and equivalent to apo B < 80 mg/dL [< 0.80 g/L] and < 90 mg/dL [0.9 g/L], respectively (Table 1). Recommendations for dyslipidemia management in diabetes, utilizing lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering agents (e.g. statins, possibly in combination with a fibrate, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, or ezetimibe) that target atherogenic cholesterol particles to specific goals determined by absolute risk, have recently been published.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^112DEs4V]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Prescriber uptake and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies [^113YEmSK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cholesterol lowering is the cornerstone of prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), because it reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, many patients with ASCVD fail to achieve lipid targets. Among patients with ASCVD in the United States, 55.5% had low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) > 70 mg/dL, including 71.8% of those on a high‐intensity statin. More recent consensus statements and guidelines recommend even lower LDL‐C levels (< 55 mg/dL) in those with ASCVD. Even with widespread use of high‐intensity statins and ezetimibe, many with ASCVD will need additional add‐on therapy to achieve an LDL‐C < 55 mg/dL. Multiple novel lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) options, including PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and bempedoic acid (BA) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients unable to reach lipid goals on statin therapy or who are intolerant to statins.

If not achieved, evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs, and increase to high-intensity statin therapy if not already taking, then reassess the same LDL-C threshold. If still not at goal, consider the following initial nonstatin agents and add others as needed to achieve desired reduction of LDL-C: consider ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 mAb; may consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran. If goals remain unmet after nonstatin therapy, referral to lipid specialist and referral to RD/RDN are directed, with continued monitoring thereafter.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115GfDUL]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in diabetes — secondary prevention lipid management specifies targets and add-on options: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all people with diabetes and ASCVD to obtain an LDL cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL cholesterol goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L). The addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended if this goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy. Figure 10.4 directs: Use lifestyle and high-intensity statin therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline to a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L); add ezetimibe or a PCSK9-directed therapy with demonstrated benefit if LDL cholesterol goals are not met on maximally tolerated statin therapy; and use an alternative lipid-lowering treatment for those who are statin intolerant, including PCSK9 inhibitor with monoclonal antibody treatment, bempedoic acid, or PCSK9 inhibitor with siRNA inclisiran.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^113GLhFg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The ESC/EAS Guidelines identify anyone with a total cholesterol > 8 mmol/L (310 mg/dL) or LDL‐C > 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) as high‐risk and maximally tolerated statin plus, if needed, ezetimibe should be used to achieve an LDL‐C goal < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Those with FH and concomitant ASCVD or another risk factor are considered very high risk. Treatment with a maximally tolerated statin and, if needed, ezetimibe is recommended (class I, C). A PCSK9 inhibitor should be added if LDL‐C remains ≥ 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for those at very high risk (class I, C) and is reasonable for those at high risk with LDL‐C above goal (class IIa, C). The Guidelines identify very high‐risk primary prevention patients as those with FH without ASCVD or additional risk factors and suggest that treatment to an LDL‐C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) is reasonable (class IIa, C). The addition of a bile acid sequestrant may be considered for those who do not achieve their LDL‐C goals despite maximal statin therapy (class IIb, C).

Primary Prevention

According to the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline, primary prevention patients are classified into various categories of 10‐year risk for fatal or nonfatal ASCVD using the Pooled Cohort Equations. Low risk is defined as < 5%, borderline 5% to 7.4%, intermediate 7.5% to 19.9%, and high ≥ 20%. Younger patients, particularly those < 40 years of age, are counseled on preventive therapy using lifetime ASCVD risk estimates, also provided as part of the Pooled Cohort Equation risk calculator. Lifestyle therapy alone is recommended for most patients at low risk, consideration of moderate‐intensity statin for those at borderline risk if risk‐enhancing factors (Table 3) are present (class IIb, B‐R), use of moderate‐intensity statins for those at intermediate risk (class I, A) and a high‐intensity statin for those at high risk, with an objective to lower LDL‐C by ≥ 50% (class I, A).

### Cholesterol lowering therapies and achievement of targets for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes: unmet needs in a large population of outpatients at specialist clinics [^1149Ms6t]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

As described in Fig. 3, among patients with a previous history of CVD (n = 11,550, 17% of the entire population), 17% where not treated with a statin. However, most of these patients had LDL-c > 1.8 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) and only 10% had LDL-c < 1.4 mmol/l (55 mg/dl). The combined use of statin plus ezetimibe was more common among patients in secondary prevention as compared to those in primary prevention (1241/11,550 [10.8%] vs 3146/56,557 [5.6%], p < 0.001), and more frequently associated with LDL-c levels below 55 mg/dl (21.2% vs 15.2%, p < 0.001). Nonetheless, among patients with prior history of CVD, more than half of subjects treated with statin ± ezetimibe had LDL-c > 1.8 mmol/l (70 mg/dl). In this group of subjects in secondary prevention, female sex and younger age were independently associated with a lower probability of achieving LDL-c < 55 mg/dl (RR 0.68 95% C. I 0.62–0.75, p < 0.001 and RR 0.89; 95% C. I 0.81–0.998, p = 0.046).

LDL-c targets and intensification of treatments

Altogether, according to CVD risk categories (Table 2), current treatments and LDL-c levels, only 35.9% of the population achieved the LDL-c targets suggested by the 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines (i.e. those available in the years in which these data are referred to). Up to date targets (i.e. those suggested the 2019 Guidelines), were reached at most by 13.9% of the population (if one considers only the absolute LDL-c levels, independently of the recommended required LDL-c reduction).

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117HxS6Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment for LDL-C reduction: statins — Statins are the first line of pharmacological treatment as an adjunct to diet and exercise to reduce LDL-C. Long-term RCTs of a median duration of 5.1 years have proven that statins reduce atherosclerotic vascular events in patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by 22% per mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C. Assessment of 10-year ASCVD risk in adults with an LDL-C of 70 to 190 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), and without a history of ASCVD should be done by the AHA/ACC Pooled Cohort Equations calculator. Some guidelines recommend risk-dependent LDL-C goals of < 130 mg/dL [3.4 mmol/L], < 100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L], < 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L], and < 55 mg/dL [1.4 mmol/L], whereas the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline specifies a high-risk threshold of LDL-C 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L], which, when exceeded, warrants intensification of statin treatment and possibly the addition of a nonstatin drug.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)

CKD is a well-known risk for cardiovascular disease and CVD mortality. It has been recognized by both nephrology and cardiovascular organizations as one of the highest risk factors for the development of CVD. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial showed that the addition of simvastatin 20 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg for CVD primary prevention significantly reduced major atherosclerotic events in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD age 40 or greater by nearly 22%. The results of the SHARP trial have been further supported by multiple meta-analyses suggesting that patients with CKD derive statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment. CVD risk attenuation of statins is the result of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), rather than a class-dependent effect. Guidelines vary in their lipid-pharmacotherapy recommendation. KDIGO and KDOQI agree that statins should be initiated in all patients aged 50 years and older with CKD, in addition to patients younger than 50 years with > 10% cardiovascular event 10-year risk. The AHA/ACC acknowledges CKD as a significant risk factor for CVD, but ultimately recommend utilizing statins for target LDL-c reduction of > 50% for high-risk patients (> 20% ASCVD risk) and 30–49% for intermediate risk (7.5–20% ASCVD risk). ESC/EAS guidelines are more aggressive and recommend LDL-c targets of < 70 mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) for patients with GFR 30–59, and < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for patients with GFR < 30. Given recent trends in CVD, a new risk score titled PREVENT has been published by the AHA that incorporates kidney disease to more accurately predict 10- and 30- year risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Nonadherence to lipid-lowering therapy and strategies to improve adherence in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114dgiJ7]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a leading cause of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent cholesterol management guidelines targeting dyslipidemia have set progressively lower target threshold levels to achieve a reduction in the risk of ASCVD or associated clinical events. The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on cholesterol management recommend using statins at maximally tolerated doses to achieve ≥ 50% lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels in patients with clinical ASCVD. Similarly, the National Lipid Association recommends an LDL‐C goal of < 70 mg/dl for patients with ASCVD. In contrast, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines include a ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction, and additional recommendation of an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dl for all patients with ASCVD.

Despite the evolution to increasingly strict lipid guideline recommendations, many potentially treatable patients remain untreated, are inadequately treated, or are non‐adherent to medication, with the consequence of suboptimal LDL‐C levels. Indeed, patterns of poor lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) implementation have been documented in observational studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012, which found that up to 80% of patients with ASCVD who were statin‐eligible did not achieve their recommended LDL‐C goal of < 70 mg/dl. Additionally, high rates of statin discontinuation have been reported in previous studies, including a cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI), showing that 15.4% of beneficiaries discontinued statins in the 6 months following hospital discharge.

Multifactorial contributors to not achieving LDL‐C goals often include both patient and physician factors. One major contributor among eligible patients with ASCVD is patient nonadherence to LLT, with key drivers that include socioeconomic factors, limited access to healthcare, treatment side effects, and the presence of comorbidities. These factors may affect patient adherence to LLT at different timepoints, with cost, healthcare disparities, or access to healthcare being likely associated with early nonadherence, and treatment side effects and polypharmacy contributing to later nonadherence.

High-risk treatment targets and limits of risk equations — risk equations should generally not be used in patients already treated for dyslipidemia and should not be used in individuals with FH because they underestimate risk. The goals of therapy for patients at high risk are non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, with consideration given to drug therapy in those whose atherogenic cholesterol levels are higher than those goal levels, generally after a trial of lifestyle therapy. Drug treatment may be started concurrently with lifestyle therapy in some high-risk patients, such as those unlikely to attain goal atherogenic cholesterol without drug therapy (eg, LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL) or with diabetes mellitus and 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

Abstract

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL‐C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL‐C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high‐intensity statin for further reduction of LDL‐C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥ 70 mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55 mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high‐risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States (US). 1 The costs of CVD are rising, driven by high‐risk patients, and are expected to nearly double to $1 trillion from 2015 to 2035. 2 Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is a well‐established causal risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). 3, 4 Accordingly, reduction of LDL‐C significantly reduces the risk of major CV events, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and it is now recognized that lower LDL‐C is better, with a progressive reduction in major CV events and no increase in safety events even at very low LDL‐C levels of < 7.7 mg/dL (< 0.2 mmol/L). 13

The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Multisociety blood cholesterol guideline introduced the stratification of "very high‐risk" (VHR) ASCVD patients, defined as those with a history of multiple major ASCVD events (ie, recent acute coronary syndrome [ACS], history of myocardial infarction [MI], history of ischemic stroke [IS], or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) or a single major ASCVD event and multiple high‐risk conditions. 14 For patients with VHR ASCVD, the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommends using an LDL‐C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to initiate the addition of nonstatins (ie, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to maximally tolerated statin therapy. 14 The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines recommend a ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), with a lower goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) for patients who experience a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. 15 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) now recommend LDL‐C goals of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) and < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) for VHR and extreme‐risk patients, respectively. 16

AACE/ACE 2017 dyslipidemia management goals — The update defines 5 risk categories with accompanying LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) goals. Extreme risk is defined as progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including unstable angina after achieving an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and the treatment goals are LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), non-HDL-C < 80 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L), or apoB < 70 mg/dL (0.7 g/L). For very high risk, treatment goals are LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), and apoB < 80 mg/dL (0.8 g/L). For high or moderate risk, LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and apoB < 90 mg/dL (0.9 g/L) are recommended; for low CVD risk (zero risk factors) the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L). Although LDL-C is the primary goal parameter, non-HDL-C is recommended first when triglycerides are between 200 and 500 mg/dL (2.3 and 5.6 mmol/L).

1.6 Cholesterol/Lipid management

Aggressive lowering of LDL‐C remains a pillar of CCD management. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guideline emphasized an LDL‐C threshold of ≤ 70 mg/dL or lower in individuals at high risk of ASCVD and to consider the use of non‐statin LDL‐C lowering medications. The 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidemia Guideline advocated for an even lower threshold LDL‐C of < 55 mg/dL or an LDL‐C lowering > 50%, whichever is lower. In 2022, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) on the role of non‐statin therapies for LDL‐C lowering in the management of ASCVD risk discussed three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved non‐statin therapies (bempedoic acid, evinacumab, inclisiran, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies), which were not previously recommended in the 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ACC cholesterol guideline.

The ECDP also recommends that for patients at very high risk of ASCVD, or those with ASCVD confirmed to have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), adding nonstatin therapies if their LDL‐C levels are 55 mg/dL or higher, on a background of high‐intensity statin treatments is recommended. For those with ASCVD who are not considered at very high risk or who have LDL‐C levels over 190 mg/dL without confirmed FH, a higher threshold — over 70 mg/dL for LDL — triggers the addition of nonstatin therapies alongside the maximum tolerated statin treatments. Ezetimibe with or without PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies is the recommended first choice for a nonstatin agent if the desired LDL‐C reduction is < 25%; otherwise a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor may be preferred.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

Lipid management

The presence of diabetic dyslipidemia in patients with T2DM is, at least in part, a cause of CVD. Moreover, diabetic dyslipidemia, including elevated triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is associated with increased CV events, especially in high-risk populations. Accounting for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification is necessary for patients with T2DM.

Lipid targets

The concept of "lower is better" regarding LDL levels has been supported for reducing the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM and CVD. The ADA guidelines recommend that lifestyle interventions be initiated for individuals with abnormal triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and/or HDL-C levels (< 40 mg/dL for men, 50 mg/dL for women), and an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% or more from baseline is reasonable for patients with diabetes and 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or higher. The ESC/EASD guidelines recommend an LDL-C target of < 55 mg/dL for those with T2DM and at very high CV risk. The AHA guidelines recommend an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline for those with diabetes and clinical CVD. The ESC established goals for LDL-C based on level of ASCVD risk. With respect to lipid targets, the AHA/ADA and the ESC/EASD guideline are shown in Table 7.

Figure 2D — adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk and baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes with clinical diagnosis or genetic confirmation of FH, on statin therapy for secondary prevention — uses a stepwise algorithm: assess whether there is ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 85 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy; if yes, decision for no additional medication. If no, 1) evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs; 2) increase to high-intensity statin therapy if not already taking; and 3) consider referral to lipid specialist and RD/RDN for all patients, especially for HoFH. Reassess the same LDL-C targets; if still not at goal, consider the following as the initial nonstatin agent and addition of other agents as needed to achieve adequate reduction of LDL-C: consider ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 mAb; may consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran; may consider evinacumab, lomitapide, and/or LDL-apheresis for HoFH under care of lipid specialist. After nonstatin therapy, if the target of ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 85 mg/dL) is achieved, monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy, and if persistent hypertriglyceridemia, refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Treat-to-target versus high-intensity statin treatment in patients with or without diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified analysis from the LODESTAR trial [^111bTipb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Current lipid management guidelines strongly recommend a stringent reduction in LDL-C level among patients with CAD to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events, and the importance of optimal LDL-C reduction is further emphasized in patients with concurrent cardiovascular risk factors such as DM. The 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines for lipid management recommend the use of high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C ≥ 50% from baseline in diabetic patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, the American Diabetes Association's 2023 update strongly recommends the use of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in diabetic patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, despite the well-recognized clinical benefits of high-intensity statin therapy in secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CAD, concerns regarded statin-related side-effects have posed a considerable hurdle for prescription of high-intensity statins and are associated with low drug adherence in these patients. In the 2019 ESC/EAS lipid guidelines, all patients with documented CAD, regardless of diabetes status, are classified as a very high-risk population and it is strongly recommended that these patients achieve at least a 50% reduction in their baseline LDL-C level and maintain their LDL-C level below 55 mg/dL. However, the guidelines also emphasize assessing safety issues and adjusting statin treatment dose accordingly (class of recommendation, IIa). Taken together, two rational therapeutic approaches have been proposed to achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction in high-risk populations: (1) adjusting the statin dose to achieve a target LDL-C level, or (2) initiating treatment with a high-intensity statin until intolerance occurs. However, there is insufficient evidence concerning which approach is most advantageous in terms of efficacy and safety profile in CAD patients, particularly those with DM, the most common cardiovascular risk factor.

Background

Whether a strategy to target an LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol < 70 mg/dL is more effective when LDL is reduced > 50% from baseline rather than < 50% from baseline has not been investigated.

Methods

The Treat Stroke to Target trial was conducted in France and South Korea in 61 sites between March 2010 and December 2018. Patients with ischemic stroke in the previous 3 months or transient ischemic attack within the previous 15 days and evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary artery atherosclerosis were randomly assigned to a target LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL or 100 ± 10 mg/dL, using statin and/or ezetimibe as needed. We used the results of repeated LDL measurements (median, 5 [2–6] per patient) during 3.9 years (interquartile range, 2.1–6.8) of follow-up. The primary outcome was the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, and vascular death. Cox regression model including lipid-lowering therapy as a time-varying variable, after adjustment for randomization strategy, age, sex, index event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), and time since the index event.

Among 2860 patients enrolled, patients in the lower target group who had > 50% LDL cholesterol reduction from baseline during the trial had a higher baseline LDL cholesterol and a lower LDL cholesterol achieved as compared to patients who had < 50% LDL cholesterol reduction (155 ± 32 and 62 mg/dL versus 121 ± 34 and 74 mg/dL, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). In the < 70 mg/dL target group, patients with > 50% LDL reduction had a significant reduction in the primary outcome as compared to the higher target group (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43–0.88]; P = 0.007) and patients with < 50% LDL reduction from baseline had little reduction (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.73–1.26]; P = 0.75).

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of the TST trial, targeting an LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL reduced the risk of primary outcome compared with 100 ± 10 mg/dL provided LDL cholesterol reduction from baseline was superior to 50%, thereby suggesting that the magnitude of LDL cholesterol reduction was as important to consider as the target level to achieve.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.
