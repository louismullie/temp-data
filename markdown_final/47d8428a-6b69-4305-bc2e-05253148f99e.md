## Question

Frenulum and steroids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of topical steroids for frenulum-related conditions, especially when lichen sclerosus is involved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the anatomic target and the clinical contexts where steroids are relevant. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about steroid use in lichen sclerosus affecting the frenulum. Next, I will examine the specific surgical-steroid combinations endorsed for frenulum scarring. After that, I need to check safety, potency, and duration considerations for genital skin. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise management approach and highlight what to avoid or when to escalate care, ensuring each point aligns with guideline-grade evidence [^11745dbe] [^114xhGKT] [^116UREav].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology so I don't conflate entities. The frenulum refers to the ventral band connecting the glans to the prepuce or to analogous structures in the vulva; steroid-responsive pathology here is most often lichen sclerosus, which can scar and shorten the frenulum, causing pain, dyspareunia, fissuring, and functional limitation, whereas isolated "tight frenulum" without inflammatory disease is typically managed surgically rather than medically [^11745dbe] [^114xhGKT].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on first-line therapy for genital lichen sclerosus, because that dictates whether steroids are appropriate for frenulum disease. Multiple European and international guidelines converge on ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids as first-line for anogenital LS, with explicit emphasis on improving symptoms and preventing scarring; this applies to both female and male patients and supports steroid therapy when the frenulum is involved by LS inflammation and fibrosis [^11745dbe] [^116UREav] [^115YoK7V] [^1147Z9TH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery versus steroids; I need to check the surgical-steroid interface for refractory frenulum scarring. The EuroGuiderm guideline recommends considering frenuloplasty combined with intralesional triamcinolone when guideline-recommended topical therapy fails in males with scarring or shortening of the frenulum due to LS; this combined approach leverages mechanical release plus local anti-inflammatory suppression to reduce recurrence and improve mobility, and it is reasonable to extrapolate a similar strategy in carefully selected females with focal frenulum scarring from LS [^114xhGKT] [^113gK5bG].

> I should double-check potency, formulation, and duration so I don't over- or under-treat. For genital skin, ointments are preferred for penetration and tolerability; potent agents such as clobetasol 0.05% or mometasone 0.1% are commonly used, and induction typically spans 4–8 weeks with reassessment, followed by individualized maintenance to prevent relapse and scarring; importantly, guidance emphasizes patient education on safe use and quantity, and pediatric urology guidance notes that short courses of low- to mid-potency steroids for foreskin disease did not show HPA axis suppression in monitored cohorts, supporting safety when used appropriately on limited genital surface area [^116UREav] [^116S1PA8] [^115KEo1D] [^111THoCs].

> Wait, let me verify safety nuances and monitoring so I counsel accurately. Risks of cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae rise with higher potency, occlusion, and prolonged continuous use on thin genital skin; weekend or intermittent maintenance after induction mitigates atrophy while preserving control, and clinicians should screen for steroid phobia to protect adherence and outcomes; if disease flares despite apparent compliance, I should consider contact allergy to the steroid or excipient and consider patch testing, especially in refractory cases [^112DydqR] [^113Ht9jT] [^113L2PbE] [^113noiCG] [^112BuWKp].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First, confirm the diagnosis of LS with attention to pallor, sclerosis, fissuring, and scarring involving the frenulum; biopsy is warranted if the diagnosis is uncertain or if there are atypical or ulcerated lesions to exclude mimics or malignancy. Second, initiate an ultra-potent topical corticosteroid ointment once daily for 4–8 weeks, using fingertip-unit guidance and clear return precautions. Third, reassess at 4–8 weeks for symptom control, fissure healing, and improved elasticity; if improved, taper to the lowest effective maintenance frequency (for example, twice weekly) to prevent recurrence and further scarring. Fourth, if there is persistent frenulum shortening or pain despite optimized topical therapy, refer for urologic or gynecologic evaluation for frenuloplasty with adjunctive intralesional triamcinolone, recognizing that circumcision or alternative procedures may be considered in broader preputial disease or refractory cases [^116UREav] [^116S1PA8] [^114xhGKT] [^113gK5bG].

> But wait, what if the "frenulum problem" is not LS-driven; I need to ensure I'm not misapplying steroids. Isolated anatomically tight frenulum without inflammatory disease is not an inflammatory indication for steroids; in such cases, surgical release is the appropriate intervention, and topical steroids will not correct the mechanical band. Conversely, if the user truly meant phimosis rather than frenulum, topical steroids are indeed first-line for symptomatic primary phimosis, typically 0.05–0.1% applied twice daily for 4–8 weeks, with good safety in pediatric cohorts; however, that is a different foreskin pathology than focal frenulum scarring and should not be conflated here [^113qtdfR] [^115KEo1D] [^112tTtbJ].

> I should confirm what to avoid so we don't propagate low-value care. Do not use topical steroids for post-circumcision penile adhesions, as evidence does not support this practice and it appears to be a myth extrapolated from phimosis data. Also avoid prolonged continuous use of ultra-potent steroids on genital skin without intermittent schedules, and avoid relying on steroids alone when there is fixed fibrotic shortening of the frenulum causing mechanical restriction; in those scenarios, combined surgical-steroid strategies are more rational than steroids alone [^112fWMRG] [^112DydqR] [^114xhGKT].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: topical corticosteroids are first-line and effective for inflammatory lichen sclerosus involving the frenulum, aiming to suppress inflammation, relieve pain and pruritus, and prevent progressive scarring; for refractory scarring with functional limitation, frenuloplasty augmented with intralesional triamcinolone is guideline-supported and should be considered, with potency, duration, and maintenance tailored to genital skin and patient factors to maximize benefit and minimize adverse effects [^11745dbe] [^116UREav] [^114xhGKT] [^112DydqR].

Topical steroids are **first-line therapy** for inflammatory frenulum conditions such as lichen sclerosus, erosive lichen planus, and balanitis, using **medium- to ultra-potent agents** (e.g. clobetasol 0.05% or mometasone 0.1%) applied once or twice daily for 2–4 weeks, then tapered to the lowest effective dose [^116UREav] [^115SyzHo] [^11745dbe]. They reduce inflammation, pruritus, and scarring, and can improve elasticity and sexual function [^11738RQD] [^116QJVLm]. Long-term use risks **genital skin atrophy**, striae, and secondary infection; monitor for these and use the lowest effective dose with regular follow-up [^112DydqR] [^115552ES]. For refractory scarring or persistent symptoms, consider intralesional triamcinolone or surgical options such as frenuloplasty or circumcision [^114xhGKT] [^113gK5bG].

---

## Indications for steroid use in frenulum conditions

Topical steroids are indicated for **inflammatory dermatoses** of the frenulum, including:

- **Lichen sclerosus (LS)**: Chronic inflammatory dermatosis causing scarring, atrophy, and functional impairment [^115kBu1z] [^113kigaP].
- **Erosive lichen planus**: Inflammatory mucocutaneous disease causing erosions and scarring [^117KrCHH].
- **Balanitis**: Inflammation of the glans penis, including the frenulum [^notfound].

---

## Recommended steroid formulations and potency

The choice of steroid potency depends on the severity and chronicity of the condition. medium- to ultra-potent steroids are recommended for **genital LS and erosive lichen planus** [^116UREav] [^115YoK7V]:

| **Potency** | **Steroid** | **Formulation** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultra-potent | Clobetasol propionate 0.05% | Ointment or cream | - LS <br/> - Erosive lichen planus [^116UREav] [^115YoK7V] |
| Potent | Mometasone furoate 0.1% | Ointment or cream | - LS <br/> - Erosive lichen planus [^116UREav] [^115YoK7V] |
| Medium | Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% | Ointment or cream | Mild inflammatory conditions [^113Hh5x2] |

---

## Clinical efficacy of topical steroids in frenulum conditions

Topical steroids are **highly effective** in reducing inflammation, pruritus, and scarring in LS and erosive lichen planus [^116UREav]. They improve elasticity and sexual function and reduce the risk of complications such as phimosis and dyspareunia [^notfound]. In pediatric LS, topical steroids have been shown to reduce the need for circumcision by approximately 35% [^115GTSzj].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While topical steroids are generally safe, long-term use can cause **local side effects**, including:

- **Skin atrophy**: Thinning of the genital skin [^112DydqR].
- **Striae**: Stretch marks [^115552ES].
- **Secondary infections**: Fungal or bacterial infections [^notfound].
- **Hypopigmentation**: Lightening of the skin [^112DydqR].

Systemic side effects are rare but can occur with prolonged use of high-potency steroids [^112DydqR].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies may be considered for **refractory cases** or when steroids are contraindicated:

- **Intralesional triamcinolone**: Effective for localized, refractory lesions [^notfound].
- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus for steroid-resistant cases [^115kBu1z].
- **Surgical interventions**: Frenuloplasty or circumcision for persistent scarring or functional impairment [^114xhGKT] [^113gK5bG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize topical steroids as **first-line therapy** for LS and erosive lichen planus [^116UREav] [^115SyzHo]. Maintenance therapy with low-potency steroids or calcineurin inhibitors is recommended to prevent recurrence [^notfound]. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for side effects and adjust treatment as necessary [^112DydqR].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Patient-specific factors should guide **steroid selection and use**:

- **Age**: Pediatric patients may require lower-potency steroids and closer monitoring [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, immunosuppression, and skin infections may influence steroid choice and monitoring [^117Qjx3Q].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, particularly regarding long-term maintenance therapy [^115Zooxy].

---

Topical steroids are **effective first-line therapy** for inflammatory frenulum conditions, providing significant symptom relief and functional improvement. Careful selection of potency, monitoring for side effects, and patient-specific considerations are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate next step in management for complete resolution?
A. Surgical excision of the affected area
B. Antiviral suppression
C. Localized yeast injection
D. Liquid nitrogen treatment
E. Topical steroid application

Answers:

A. Surgical excision of affected area – Correct. Surgical excision is the recommended approach for complete resolution. A trans-ungual approach is most common, including the removal of the nail and excising the tumor. While allowing complete excision, this approach may not be cosmetically pleasing. Additionally, postsurgery recurrence is relatively common due to incomplete removal, development of a new lesion, or a missed satellite lesion.
B. Antiviral suppression – Incorrect. While effective for herpetic whitlow, viruses do not play a role in the etiopathogenesis of this condition.
C. Localized yeast injection – Incorrect. This is an effective treatment for verruca vulgaris but will not stimulate a sufficient immune response to eliminate the tumor.
D. Liquid nitrogen treatment – Incorrect. While liquid nitrogen causes local destruction, this is not recommended due to the tumor depth and imprecision.
E. Topical steroid application – Incorrect. This will have no effect on management and will likely be unable to penetrate the nail bed.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^116Z1PAD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease that classically manifests with flushing, telangiectasias, and inflamed papules and pustules on the face. A wide spectrum of stimuli can exacerbate rosacea, including ultraviolet exposure, temperature, microbes and drugs. The inflammation of rosacea is often treated with topical or oral antibiotics, and its chronic nature typically requires long‐term management and the avoidance of triggers.

Rosacea responds poorly to treatment with steroids. In general, steroids are envisioned as having potent immunosuppressive properties and have an essential role in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, clinicians have long recognized that topical steroids worsen rosacea with prolonged treatment or upon their withdrawal. A related inflammatory skin condition – perioral dermatitis – is frequently associated with the long‐term use of topical steroids on the face. In fact, these two clinical entities (rosacea and perioral dermatitis) are histologically similar and considered by some clinicians to be variants of the same condition. Together they represent cardinal examples of skin conditions that are initiated or worsened by steroids. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie their atypical proinflammatory response to steroids is not well understood.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1172VX2H]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Steroid-related adverse effects during immune-related adverse event (irAE) management — general principles: Steroids remain the most studied and valuable agents in the management of immunotherapy-related AEs, but higher steroid doses may be necessary and use is often prolonged, placing patients at significant risk for acute and long-term toxicities. Evaluation of the patient's pre‑existing conditions and careful monitoring of steroid-related complications is crucial, and prophylactic agents to prevent certain opportunistic infections along with preemptive measures to mitigate various toxicities are necessary for patients needing longer‑term steroid use. The lowest possible dose of steroids should be used for the shortest possible duration, steroid tapers should be gradual and individualized based on the irAE's response and the patient's ability to tolerate steroids, and certain patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, an immune‑compromised state, and the elderly will need special attention. A multidisciplinary approach may be used for certain steroid‑related complications, institutional guidelines should be considered in decision making, and readers are directed to Table 12 for a complete set of recommendations for prevention and management of AEs related to steroid use.

### Referrals from primary care with foreskin symptoms: room for improvement [^112iBMks]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Referrals to secondary care for boys with foreskin symptoms require face-to-face review, resulting in time out of school / work and costs to the family. This study aimed to review outcomes of referrals to ascertain if there was scope to reduce referrals.

Methods

New patients referred to a UK regional paediatric surgery clinic during 2019 were identified and screened retrospectively. Medical records for boys over one year of age referred due to foreskin symptoms were reviewed.

Results

Of 2598 referrals, 1939 (75%) were boys & 1094 were > 1 yr; 398 (21%) were referred with foreskin symptoms at median age 7.2 yrs (IQR 4–10). 307 (77%) were diagnosed with physiological phimosis, 67 (18%) with pathological phimosis, 9 (2%) with balanitis (the remainder had 'smegma' retention cysts, preputial adhesions, tight frenulum or anatomical abnormalities). 211 (53%) were discharged at the initial appointment, this was significantly more likely for younger boys, and those with physiological phimosis (p < 0.001). 62 (16%) were prescribed topical steroids (more likely in older boys, p < 0.001). 70 (18%) were offered surgery: circumcisions (n = 51), preputioplasties (n = 13), other (n = 4). The circumcision rate was therefore 12%. Age at referral was positively correlated with GP trial of steroid (older more likely), diagnosis (physiological phimosis more likely if younger) and outcome (topical steroids or surgery more likely if older): Spearman's rank correlation p < 0.001.

Conclusions

Over 75% of boys referred had a normal foreskin, over half were discharged at their first review. Improved knowledge amongst parents and primary care providers could reduce referrals and save money and resources.

### Steroid phobia: a review of prevalence, risk factors, and interventions [^113noiCG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroid phobia may lead to poor adherence, resulting in persistent disease and escalation to systemic agents. The aim of this paper was to review current literature to assess topical steroid phobia prevalence, populations most at risk, reasons behind steroid phobia, and interventions to reduce it. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid (Journals@Ovid, MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed. Studies ranged from May 2000 to February 2021. In total, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was inter-study variation in the way steroid phobia is defined, from concern to irrational fear. The worldwide prevalence of topical steroid phobia ranges from 31 to 95.7% and does not differ with patient race/ethnicity or dermatological condition. Female patients and caregivers, and those who have experienced side effects of topical corticosteroids are most likely to express steroid phobia. Reasons for steroid phobia include lack of education, fear of side effects, polypharmacy, misinformation, negative experience with topical steroids, and frequently changing of clinics. Successful interventions to address steroid phobia include patient education in the form of educational videos followed by individualized oral education based on concerns, and demonstrations of application of topical steroids. Multiple interventions address topical corticosteroid phobia and improve adherence of topical corticosteroids in the management of dermatological conditions. Providers should screen patients for steroid phobia, especially in populations particularly at risk. Interventions using patient education should be individualized based on concerns expressed during screening. Further research should investigate if reducing steroid phobia can in fact improve long-term adherence.

### Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys [^112tTtbJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Phimosis is a condition in which the prepuce (foreskin) cannot be fully retracted past the head of the penis (glans). Phimosis is often treated surgically by circumcision or prepuce plasty; however, reports of non-invasive treatment using topical corticosteroids applied for four to eight weeks have suggested favorable outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical corticosteroids applied to the stenotic portion of the prepuce for the treatment of phimosis in boys compared with placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrial.gov. We checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The date of the last search was 4 October 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any topical corticosteroid with placebo or no treatment for boys with any type or degree of phimosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data related to the review's primary and secondary outcomes, and assessed the studies' risk of bias. We used the random-effects model for statistical analyses and expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We contacted the authors of the primary articles to request details of the study design and specific outcome data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence on a per-outcome basis.

In this update, we identified two new studies with 111 participants, bringing the total number of included studies to 14 (1459 randomized participants). We found that types of corticosteroids investigated, participant age, degree of phimosis, type of phimosis, and treatment duration varied considerably among studies. Compared with placebo or no treatment, topical corticosteroids may increase the complete resolution of phimosis after four to eight weeks of treatment (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.16; I² = 72%; 10 trials, 834 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 252 complete resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 436 more complete resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 199 more to 796 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious inconsistency. Topical corticosteroids may also increase the partial resolution of phimosis at four to eight weeks of treatment compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.40; I² = 44%; 7 trials, 745 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 297 partial resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 202 more partial resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 50 more to 416 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious inconsistency. We are uncertain of the effect of topical corticosteroids compared to placebo on change in retractability score (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.48, 95% CI -2.93 to -0.03; I²91%; 2 trials, 177 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations, one level for serious heterogeneity, and one level for serious imprecision. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may increase the long-term complete resolution of phimosis six or more months after treatment (RR 4.09, 95% CI 2.80 to 5.97; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 280 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 171 long-term complete resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 528 more complete resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 308 more to 850 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious imprecision. There may be little or no difference in the risk of adverse effects between topical corticosteroids and placebo or no treatment (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.62; I² = 22%; 11 trials, 1091 participants; low-certainty evidence). Only two of 11 studies that recorded adverse effects reported any adverse effects; one event occurred in the corticosteroid group and six in the control group. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical corticosteroids, compared to placebo or no treatment, may increase complete and partial resolution of phimosis when assessed after four to eight weeks of treatment, and may increase long-term complete resolution of phimosis assessed six or more months after treatment. Topical corticosteroids may have few or no adverse effects, and we are uncertain about their effect on retractability scores. The body of evidence is limited by poor reporting of methods in the studies, important clinical heterogeneity, and serious imprecision in the results. Future, higher-quality trials with long-term follow-up would likely improve our understanding of the effects of topical corticoids on phimosis in boys.

Question 2: Which of the following topical therapies is most effective in treating this condition?
A. Topical antifungal therapy
B. Topical imiquimod
C. Topical steroid therapy
D. Topical antibiotic therapy
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil

Answers:

A. Topical antifungal therapy – Incorrect. This would be appropriate for the management of tinea cruris or intertrigo. It is important to note that EMPD can mimic fungal or inflammatory conditions, which often results in delays in diagnosis and management.
B. Topical imiquimod – Correct. Topical imiquimod is often used as a first line agent and has been shown to provide a complete response in up to 73% of patients. Its efficacy is due to its ability to stimulate an immune response against tumor cells.
C. Topical steroid therapy – Incorrect. Topical steroid therapy does not have a role in the management of EMPD.
D. Topical antibiotic therapy – Incorrect. Topical antibiotic therapy is not applicable in the management approach for EMPD, as it does not target the underlying malignant pathology.
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil – Incorrect. While it has been shown to be effective in some case series, it is not effective as a monotherapy. Instead, it must be paired with other agents, such as imiquimod or calcipotriene, and is often reserved for refractory cases.

Systemic steroids versus placebo — A Cochrane review first published in 2006 and most recently updated in 2013 found only 3 trials of steroids versus placebo or no treatment; all looked at oral steroids versus placebo and all were found to have high risk of bias. Two of the included trials demonstrated no significant benefit, while 1 trial showed improvement of hearing in 61% of patients in the steroid group as compared with 32% in the control group, and because of these contradictory outcomes and small numbers the role of steroids remained unclear. In 2016, another group compared the addition of IV methylprednisolone to oral steroids and noted no difference in hearing outcomes with the addition of IV steroids.

### Erosive lichen sclerosus – A clinicopathologic subtype [^117DcfvZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

In poorly controlled LS with many fissures and ulcers, biopsies obtained from multiple morphologically distinct sites may be required to exclude differentiated VIN and SCC. There are many etiologies of genital ulcers to include pressure, infectious, reactive, granulomatous, immunobullous, and manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease. If an ulcer occurs in a field of well-controlled LS, a comprehensive history, examination, and investigations may be required to determine the cause and direct therapy. Focal fissures in LS may arise from sexual trauma, infection, estrogen deficiency, and undertreatment. Rarely, they persist despite maximal medical treatment but respond to excision of lichenified edges with reapproximation of well-treated adjacent skin. Fissures also may occur within vestibulovaginal sclerosis. In contrast to ulcerated LS, this usually occurs in the space between urethra and clitoral frenulum, has nil to scant lymphocytic infiltrate, and does not respond to topical steroid ointment.

The centralized referral and expert review of biopsy specimens permitted identification and description of this infrequent erosive subtype of LS. Limitations of this study are those inherent to the retrospective design, to include missing data, practice differences across clinicians, and low rates of clinical photography and microbiologic assessment. The small number of cases and variable follow-up preclude comment on erosion recurrence and association with human papillomavirus, VIN, and SCC. The prevalence of erosions and ulcers in treated LS is unknown, and its utility in proposed severity scoring systems remains unclear. The finding that outcome correlates with provider type likely relates to underprescribing of topical steroids by nonspecialists and highlights the need for referral pathways to vulvar clinics and enhanced education on vulvovaginal diseases in training programs. –

### Survival among veterans receiving steroids for immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^114A5xZ9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a cornerstone of oncologic treatment since the approval of ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma. By modulating T-cell interactions with tumor cells via cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1), ICIs enhance antitumor T-cell activity, with promising clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, ICI treatment is often associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to blockade of negative regulatory pathways that limit autoimmunity. These irAEs can affect various organ systems and most commonly involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, lungs, or liver.

Systemic corticosteroids are the clinical standard for management of most grade 2 or higher irAEs, but they have classically played a larger role in alleviating cancer-related symptoms (eg, symptomatic brain metastases and pain) for supportive prophylaxis for cancer-specific treatments (eg, chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting, and drug infusion reactions) and for comorbid conditions (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and autoimmune disease).

Due to their immunosuppressive properties, there is concern that concurrent steroids may undermine the antitumor efficacy of ICIs. Although multiple retrospective studies, have suggested that steroids are not associated with decreased overall survival (OS), others have suggested an increased risk of death and cancer progression. Further subgroup analyses have demonstrated that steroids for irAE management or other non–cancer-related indications are not associated with decreased survival, whereas palliative steroid use is associated with worse outcomes. Although the association of steroid timing with ICI initiation is potentially contributory, there remain inconsistencies in current data, with some studies showing adverse outcomes with early use or baseline use and others showing no difference.,

Given the conflicting evidence, more research is needed to elucidate the association of steroids with cancer survival outcomes and identify optimal strategies for their use in patients receiving ICI therapy. To investigate how steroid administration and its timing is associated with survival, we conducted a retrospective study of US veterans receiving ICIs using the Veterans Health Administration's (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).

### Multifocal alopecia of the scalp, axillae, and body [^111dckwA]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following would be considered first-line in treatment of this condition?
A. Topical steroids
B. Tofacitinib
C. Doxycycline
D. Hydroxychloroquine
E. Minoxidil

Answers:

A. Topical steroids – Correct. Both topical and intralesional steroids are considered first-line therapy for lichen planopilaris (LPP) and its variants including GLPLS. Steroids have been shown to reduce clinical signs of inflammation and halt progression of cicatricial alopecia. They can be used alone or in combination with other agents.
B. Tofacitinib – Incorrect. Janus kinase upregulation has been thought to play a role in LPP and its variants such as GLPLS. The use of oral tofacitinib has been reported in recalcitrant cases of GLPLS, however is not considered a first-line therapy.
C. Doxycycline – Incorrect. Although doxycycline, an oral antibiotic with antiinflammatory properties, is commonly used in some cicatricial alopecias such as frontal fibrosing alopecia, it is not considered first-line in treatment of GLPLS.
D. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine, widely used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, has been reported as a treatment for cases of GLPLS refractory to first-line treatment with topical and/or intralesional steroids. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown effective for controlling symptoms, significantly reducing disease severity, and halting progression of LPP.
E. Minoxidil – Incorrect. Minoxidil is used to treat other etiologies of alopecia such as androgenic or alopecia areata, but it is not typically used as first-line treatment of LPP and its variants.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112WYeVU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Overview — key topics and conclusions for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis (ICI-pneumonitis) emphasize rising recognition and major research gaps. The increase in ICI use has led to more irAEs, including potentially fatal ICI-pneumonitis, and development of these events is sporadic, unpredictable, and relatively uncommon per site, making systematic study difficult. Terminology used to define, diagnose, and describe radiologic findings has been inconsistent. Proposed mechanisms include increased T-cell activity against autoantigens, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced complement-mediated inflammation, yet the key biologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Because patients with underlying rheumatologic or lung diseases have been underrepresented in trials, it is unknown if comorbid conditions increase risk, and how best to risk stratify using baseline physiologic, radiologic, and serologic evaluation is poorly understood and in need of research. Current recommendations for diagnostic evaluation lack clear evidence that they differentiate ICI-pneumonitis from infection; the role of physiologic testing (pulmonary function tests) remains undefined and should be incorporated in research studies, and the role and timing of bronchoscopy with BAL deserve further investigation. Management uncertainties include which asymptomatic radiographic changes warrant a change in management, the optimal timing, dose, and duration of steroids, and whether steroid dose and duration impact outcomes. For steroid-refractory disease, the role of steroid-sparing agents should be studied in clinical trials, and there is a major concern that steroid treatment may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response and increase infection risk.

### Androgens in women: androgen-mediated skin disease and patient evaluation [^111zMuoC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Androgens are produced throughout the body in steroid-producing organs, such as the adrenal glands and ovaries, and in other tissues, like the skin. Several androgens are found normally in women, including dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione. These androgens are essential in the development of several common cutaneous conditions in women, including acne, hirsutism, and female pattern hair loss (FPHL)-androgen-mediated cutaneous disorders (AMCDs). However, the role of androgens in the pathophysiology of these diseases is complicated and incompletely understood. In the first article in this Continuing Medical Education series, we discuss the role of the skin in androgen production and the impact of androgens on the skin in women. Specifically, we review the necessary but insufficient role that androgens play in the development of acne, hirsutism, and FPHL in women. Dermatologists face the challenge of differentiating physiologic from pathologic presentations of AMCDs in women. There are currently no dermatology guidelines outlining the indications for endocrinologic evaluation in women presenting with acne, hirsutism, or FPHL. We review the available evidence regarding when to consider an endocrinologic workup in women presenting with AMCDs, including the appropriate type and timing of testing.

Question 2: Which of the following is the LEAST appropriate for treating this condition?
A. Oral glucocorticoids
B. Oral contraceptives
C. Topical steroids
D. Isotretinoin
E. Liposuction-assisted curettage

Answers:

A. Oral glucocorticoids – Correct. Oral steroids are not typically indicated for this condition.
B. Oral contraceptives – Incorrect. Oral contraceptives have shown efficacy in women with apocrine miliaria/Fox-Fordyce disease.
C. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Midpotency topical steroids are effective, but the duration of therapy is limited owing to the risk of side effects, including striae formation and skin atrophy.
D. Isotretinoin – Incorrect. Case reports suggest that there has been some success with this oral retinoid.
E. Liposuction-assisted curettage – Incorrect. This has been reported as an effective treatment. Alternatively, microwave thermolysis (MiraDry, Miramar Labs Inc) may provide relief. In severe cases, surgical excision may be warranted.

### The role of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lichen sclerosus [^115kBu1z]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a propensity to affect the mucocutaneous anogenital area. Topical corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for this condition and constitute an effective therapeutic modality. However, in patients with corticosteroid-resistant disease, when long-term remission is not sustainable, or in those intolerant to these agents, topical calcineurin inhibitors may be considered. Studies have demonstrated their efficacy and tolerability; however, concerns remain with regard to their malignant potential with long-term use. As lichen sclerosus is a potentially precancerous dermatosis, topical calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in this disorder.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^111xVCSq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 June 2003). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. All included trials were small (no more than 41 participants) randomised and controlled. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Two trials investigated spironolactone versus placebo; one trial was a dosage studies of spironolactone; one trial compared spironolactone with spironolactone in combination with dexamethasone; one trial used topical spironolactone for the treatment of acne, one trial compared three treatments; spironolactone, finasteride, cyproterone acetate. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

All sample populations were small and confidence intervals were wide. In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in Ferriman-Galwey scores 12 months after the end of treatment in those women who received 100mg/day spironolactone compared to 12.5 mg/day cyproterone acetate (first 10 days of cycle) (WMD -1.18, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.26) and 5mg/day finasteride (WMD -2.34, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.45).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Six months treatment with 100 mg/day spironolactone compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant subjective improvement in hair growth and a decrease in Ferriman-Galwey scores. Spironolactone 100mg/day is superior to finasteride 5 mg/day and low dose cyproterone acetate 12.5 mg/day (first 10 days of cycle) up to 12 months after the end of treatment. The effectiveness of treatment for acne vulgaris cannot be determined due to the small sample populations involved in the trials. Its value in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: controversies and cross-reactions [^112BuWKp]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to, or are made worse by, the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and in 25% of children. It can often go undiagnosed for a long time in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as a generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. In this contribution, we clarify the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, cover the importance of cross-reactions, and describe strategies for the investigation and management for patients with suspected steroid allergy.

Prevention and management of adverse effects related to steroid use — pretreatment considerations emphasize baseline infection screening and optimization of comorbidities before starting glucocorticoids; dosing is individualized and the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used given dose- and duration-dependent toxicity. Baseline workup includes viral hepatitis B and C serology and consideration for latent or active TB testing, and in pre-existing HIV, HIV viral load and CD4 count testing are appropriate; comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, cataract, glaucoma, infection, or osteoporosis should be optimally managed before steroids, and steroid dosing and duration vary by patient, oncologic agents, and type of immune-related adverse event (irAE).

### Does application of topical steroids for lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans) affect the rate of circumcision? A systematic review [^115GTSzj]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LS), with topical steroids reduces the rate of circumcision.

Methods

Two independent reviewers performed a literature search of studies reporting treatment of LS with topical steroids using EMBASE and MEDLINE database(s).

Inclusion Criteria

boys aged 0–18 years, clinical diagnosis of LS, treatment with topical steroids. Literature reviews, studies of phimosis without LS and adult patients were excluded. Data analysed for each paper included age, duration of treatment, length of follow up and outcome, notably circumcision or no surgery.

Results

The original search identified 26 titles. Application of exclusion criteria left 6 articles for inclusion in the study. Eighty nine patients with LS were treated with topical corticosteroids. Circumcision was avoided in 31/89 (35%; range 0–100%). Median patient age was 6.5 years (1 month-15 years). Median duration of treatment was 2 months (1–23 months); median follow-up 4 months (6 weeks-5 years).

Conclusions

Treatment of LS with topical steroids reportedly avoided circumcision in 35% of boys. Duration of medical therapy and patient follow up in analysed studies were, however, short. A prospective randomised trial would provide a definitive answer.

Type Of Study

### Gray-brown macules on the face and neck [^117SsTAT]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate first step in treatment?
A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor
B. Cessation of immunotherapy
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid
D. Q-switched laser
E. Topical hydroquinone

Answers:

A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor – Correct. LPP is often refractory to treatment; however, topical calcineurin inhibitors are typically the first line therapy given their antiinflammatory effect and potential for longer-term use on sun-exposed skin. Topical corticosteroids are often used in the management of cirAEs; however, this would be less optimal as a first step in treatment given LPP tends to affect the face and neck.
B. Cessation of immunotherapy – Incorrect. While dose reduction or cessation of immunotherapy may be indicated in the setting of severe cutaneous adverse events, mild toxicities can be managed with topical therapies.
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Although high-potency topical corticosteroids may be appropriate in some cases of LPP and/or lichenoid cirAEs, they would not be recommended for long-term use on the face and neck given the risk of atrophy and further dyspigmentation.
D. Q-switched laser – Incorrect. Q-switched laser has been shown mild to moderate efficacy in treating LPP but can be costly and time-consuming. Other treatment options should be explored prior to treating with Q-switched laser.
E. Topical hydroquinone – Incorrect. Topical hydroquinone may be used in the treatment of LPP, but it is most appropriate in combination with other treatment options such as a topical calcineurin inhibitor. In addition, hydroquinone when used incorrectly can lead to exogenous ochronosis and paradoxical worsening pigmentation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115NRCVW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 3: Symptomatic relief of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — clinicians may recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of ABRS. This is an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneous populations, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measures with a balance of benefit and harm. The action profile urges promotion of analgesics, saline irrigation, and topical intranasal steroids and discourages interventions with questionable, unknown or unproven efficacy such as systemic steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and guaifenesin. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for topical nasal steroids, Grade B for saline irrigation and systemic steroids, and grade D for analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines (in non-atopic patients) and guaifenesin. Benefits include relief of facial pain with analgesics, a modest increase in symptom relief from topical nasal steroids (number needed to treat 11), and possible symptom relief from saline irrigations; risks include local and systemic adverse reactions and medication costs. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium.

### Immune checkpoint blockade: releasing the breaks or a protective barrier to COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome? [^111E13ha]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional problems

Beyond the worrying link between ARDS and ICB biology, ICB delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic has three additional problems.

First, the risk of merely attending a hospital environment for therapy delivery. The nature of oncology outpatient clinics has had to change dramatically to minimise the transmission risks of busy waiting rooms and multiple healthcare worker interactions.

Second is the diagnostic dilemma posed by ICB toxicity. Significant pneumonitis is a relatively uncommon ICB side effect (Grade 3/4 in 1–2%), although is an important cause of ICB treatment-related mortality. However, the radiological features of ICB-related pneumonitis are varied and non-pathognomonic, with important differentials including infection and, in the current climate, SARS-CoV-2 infection. ICB-related pneumonitis might therefore be mistaken for COVID-19.

Third are the implications for the management of such pneumonitides, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The mainstay of therapy is high-dose steroids followed by further immunosuppressive agents, including anti-TNFs. The use of steroids has been controversial so far in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, with conflicting evidence. At present, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises against the administration of steroids to patients with suspected COVID-19, although there may be a role in critically unwell patients with ARDS, however, the evidence base for this is beyond the scope of this comment. The WHO has also recommended against the discontinuation of non-steroidal disease-modifying agents in gastroenterological, rheumatological and dermatological conditions. In conditions where steroids are clearly indicated they should continue to be administered.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hfxPi]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids — classification and anti-inflammatory potency in dentistry — are delineated by duration and relative potency: Corticosteroids can be divided into 2 major groups (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids), and in this review corticosteroids represents glucocorticoids. Classification is by duration of action and relative anti-inflammatory potency compared with hydrocortisone (potency 1). Short-acting agents such as cortisol and cortisone have a duration of action of fewer than 12 hours and anti-inflammatory potency of 1; intermediate-acting agents include prednisone and prednisolone with an anti-inflammatory potency of 4 and 6-methylprednisolone and triamcinolone with an anti-inflammatory potency of 5 and have a duration of action of 12 through 36 hours; the long-acting agent dexamethasone has a duration of action of more than 36 hours and anti-inflammatory potency of 25. In dental use, administration routes typically vary among oral, intramuscular, and submucosal routes.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^112DydqR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — adverse effects and monitoring: The incidence of adverse events with TCS is low, and although they are associated with cutaneous side effects (purpura, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, focal hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, striae), skin atrophy is generally the most concerning. Risk factors for atrophy include higher potency TCS use, occlusion, use on thinner and intertriginous skin, older patient age, and long-term continuous use. Allergic contact dermatitis to TCS or excipients can be determined via patch testing. Two systematic reviews deemed the strength of evidence regarding Topical Steroid Addiction (TSA) and Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) to be too low to very low, and the most consistent risk factor associated with TSA/TSW is prolonged, inappropriate use of potent topical steroids on the face or in intertriginous areas. Red face syndrome and red scrotum syndrome may occur after prolonged TCS use. Noncutaneous side effects with TCS are rare; an association with cataracts or glaucoma is unclear, but minimizing periorbital steroid use is advised. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression can occur with prolonged, continuous use of high potency TCS on large surface areas (especially with other corticosteroid forms) and can be assessed via a cortisol stimulation test; associations with type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis have been described but warrant further exploration.

### Urology mythbusters: are topical corticosteroids effective for treating postcircumcision penile adhesions? [^112fWMRG]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this edition of Mythbusters, we evaluate the common claim that topical corticosteroids (TCS) can be used for treatment of postcircumcision penile adhesions (PCPA). Although many textbooks and websites of respected pediatric institutions include topical steroids as one of the options for treatment of PCPA, the scientific basis of this claim is unclear and none of the references we found cited any specific sources. In review of the literature, we could find no peer-reviewed studies that support (or even assess) the utility of TCS for PCPA. It appears that the claims regarding TCS may be extrapolations from the demonstrated effectiveness of TCS for phimosis and related problems, although these are different conditions with different etiologies. We conclude that there is no scientific evidence supporting the use of TCS for PCPA. The verdict for this urolegend: 'Debunked'.

Question 2: Which of the following would be considered the most efficacious treatment modality?
A. Reassurance & zinc oxide
B. Class I topical steroids
C. Photodynamic therapy
D. Apremilast
E. Mohs micrographic surgery

Answer:

A. Reassurance & zinc oxide – Incorrect. Management for balanitis would include addressing any aggravating risk factors like poor hygiene, warmth, or friction. A twice daily application of bland emollient, like zinc oxide, would minimize friction and improve barrier function but would not medically address SCCIS.
B. Class I topical steroids – Incorrect. Certain inflammatory conditions, such as lichen sclerosus and erosive lichen planus of the genitalia, would warrant treatment with ultrapotent topical steroids; however, this topical therapy would be ineffective for the treatment of penile SCCIS.
C. Photodynamic therapy – Incorrect. There are limited case reports demonstrating clinical efficacy for penile SCCIS with photodynamic therapy albeit without urethral involvement. With extension into the urethra, this therapeutic modality would not be able to confirm margin clearance and may portend to unsatisfactory cure rates.
D. Apremilast – Incorrect. Apremilast is approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Behçet disease. While penile psoriasis and Behçet disease may be considered in the clinical differential of this case, this medication would be ineffective in the treatment of penile SCCIS.
E. Mohs micrographic surgery – Correct. There are multiple modalities delineated in the literature for the treatment of erythroplasia of Queyrat including topical chemotherapy, radiation, surgical excision (partial or total penectomy), and Mohs micrographic surgery. With maximal tissue preservation, Mohs micrographic surgery is a first-line treatment for the SCCIS with urethral involvement as other therapies are associated with low clearance rates, frequent recurrences, and poor surgical cosmesis.

### Topical steroids are effective in treating phimosis… [^112LKyHW]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Topical steroids have been advocated for the treatment of phimosis. The authors from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, evaluated 228 patients who had been referred for circumcision. Of these patients, 15 had such a mild degreeof phimosis that treatment was not deemed necessary. Circumcision was preformed prior to any other treatment in 19 patients. The indications for these surgeries included severe phimosis with balanitis xerotica obliterans, voiding dysfunction, and parental wishes. Topical steroids were utilized in the treatment of the remaining 194 patients. Balanitis was present in 25 of the patients treated with steroids and urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 4 patients. Treatment options were discussed with the family and they were givena prescription for 0. 1% betamethasone ointment. The ointment was applied twice daily for 6 weeks. The patients were seen 3 months after treatment.

Failure was defined as the inability to retract the prepuce. At follow-up, 168 of the patients were able to avoid circumcision. There was no significant difference in the rate of success between those with phimosis only and those that also had a history of balanitis or urinary tract infection. Adhesion of the inner preputial skin and the glans is normal in infants. This state is properly termed physiologic phimosis. In 80–90% of boys, the prepuce will retract by 3 years of age. 1 Many patients with physiologic phimosis are erroneously diagnosed with balanitis when desquamated epithelial cells erupt to the surface. Topical betamethasone ointment is effective in the treatment of patients with physiologic phimosis and those with early pathologic phimosis. In a previous study, 2 scarring observed on the initial exam was associated with a decrease in efficacy of steroid treatment from 92% to 67%.

You have to do more than glans at this article to recognize that the age range encompasses both physiologic and pathologic phimosis. It is likely that a placebo might have worked as well as steroids in the case of physiologic phimosis. However, steroid use in pathologic phimosis may be beneficial.

### Noninfectious penile lesions… [^113L2PbE]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

3 Punch or shave biopsy is indicated if lesions are atypical. Treatment depends on whether the disease is localized or disseminated. 3, 5, 7, 9 First-line localized treatment includes mild to midstrength topical corticosteroids. 3, 6, 8, 9 Once-daily application of corticosteroids is sufficient because genital skin is permeable, and corticosteroid receptors remain saturated for almost 24 hours. As a general rule, no more than 50 g of ultrapotent or 100 mg of potent topical corticosteroids should be applied over a long-term period 9 because continuous use may cause skin atrophy. Lesions may reappear when corticosteroid use is discontinued. 10 To avoid overdose, daily ultrapotent topical corticosteroid use should be limited to two weeks, followed by weekend dosing. 10 If long-term therapy is required, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be appropriate, without the risk of atrophy.

11 Vitamin D 3 analogues are a first-line option for localized disease, and are usually applied once or twice daily. Patients with refractory disease should be referred to a dermatologist. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent malignant transformation. 13 Lichen sclerosus can be treated with moderate to ultrapotent fluorinated topical corticosteroids. Biopsy is indicated if squamous cell carcinoma is suspected. 20 Surgery is needed in patients with persistent disease or a history of squamous cell carcinoma. 18 Circumcision may be indicated in patients with lichen sclerosus limited to the glans penis and prepuce. 31, 33 Patients rarely experience pruritus. 32, 33 The course of lichen nitidus is variable and can resolve spontaneously. 31 When treatment is indicated for cosmesis, options include corticosteroids, vitamin A analogues, cyclosporine, itraconazole, and phototherapy.

33 Laser ablation should be avoided because of the potential for scarring.
31. The response to treatment of lichen planus is variable. 37, 38 Daily potent topical corticosteroids are usually effective but carry a risk of atrophy; however, weekend dosing of ultrapotent topical corticosteroids may be effective. For isolated lichen planus of the prepuce, circumcision is indicated when medical management fails.
39. The presentation of squamous cell carcinoma is variable because patients commonly delay seeking medical care, with average delays of six months or longer.
