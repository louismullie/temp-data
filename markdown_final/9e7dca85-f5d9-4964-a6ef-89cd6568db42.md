## Question

Right buttocks pain after fall

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage right buttock pain after a fall. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and stabilization. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the physical exam maneuvers that distinguish hip, sacroiliac, lumbar, and soft-tissue etiologies. After that, I need to check the imaging algorithm, especially when radiographs are normal but suspicion remains high. Then, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline initial management by category. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, escalation triggers, and special considerations such as anticoagulation, osteoporosis, and neurologic deficits, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-level evidence and case-based data.

> Let me first confirm red flags and immediate stabilization priorities, because missing a fracture, infection, or vascular catastrophe would be unacceptable. I need to ensure there is no inability to bear weight, gross deformity, rapidly expanding hematoma, fever or systemic toxicity, or focal neurologic deficit suggesting sciatic compromise or compartment syndrome, as these mandate urgent action and often advanced imaging or surgical consultation [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently refine the differential. Mechanism matters: a direct blow to the buttock raises concern for ischial fracture, contusion, or Morel-Lavallée lesion, whereas a fall onto the hip or back may implicate sacral, pelvic ring, or lumbar injuries; inability to bear weight or groin pain suggests occult hip fracture even with normal initial films; radiation to the posterior thigh or foot hints at sciatic involvement; and new neurologic symptoms push me toward nerve compression or injury, including piriformis-related deep gluteal syndrome or sciatic neuropathy [^1142nT7G] [^1123hkUK] [^114Pp8ZA].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical exam sequence that separates hip, sacroiliac, lumbar, and soft-tissue sources. I will inspect for ecchymosis, deformity, and limb position; palpate the ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, sacroiliac joints, and lumbar paraspinals; and perform FABER, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen for sacroiliac pain, FADIR and active piriformis tests for piriformis-related symptoms, straight leg raise for radiculopathy, and neurovascular checks including distal pulses and strength/sensation of the sciatic distribution; focal ischial tenderness supports ischial injury or ischiogluteal bursitis, whereas pain with FABER or thigh thrust supports sacroiliac pathology [^1156wkVD] [^111xZWFd] [^117DzC8a].

> I need to check the imaging algorithm carefully, because early radiographs can miss fractures. Plain AP pelvis and dedicated hip films are first-line after a fall in older adults, but if radiographs are normal and suspicion persists for fracture or stress injury, MRI is indicated; ACR recommends MRI for suspected stress fracture when radiographs are negative or indeterminate, and AAFP similarly advises MRI or bone scan when occult hip fracture remains likely despite normal films, especially in patients over 65 or with high-risk features [^111YfF3U] [^112bGxwe] [^1123hkUK].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis in tiers, and I should double-check that I am not prematurely anchoring. Tier 1 includes traumatic fractures of the sacrum, ischium, or pelvic ring; acute sacroiliac joint injury; and sciatic nerve injury or compression including piriformis syndrome and deep gluteal syndrome; Tier 2 includes soft-tissue injuries such as ischiogluteal bursitis, Morel-Lavallée lesion, and gluteal muscle contusion; Tier 3 includes referred pain from lumbar facet or disc disease and vascular or infectious mimics; importantly, buttock pain can reflect occult hip fracture even when the patient localizes pain posteriorly, so I must keep hip pathology high on the list in older adults [^1123hkUK] [^1142nT7G] [^114Pp8ZA].

> For sacral or pelvic ring fractures, I should confirm that MRI is the modality of choice when radiographs are non-diagnostic, and I must remember that sacral insufficiency fractures are not rare in older adults even without major trauma; management is typically nonoperative with protected weight bearing and pain control, with orthopedics follow-up to monitor healing and reassess stability [^112bGxwe].

> For ischial body fractures, let me verify that CT best delineates displacement and pelvic ring integrity; non-displaced injuries are managed conservatively, whereas displaced fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation to restore hamstring origin integrity and mitigate persistent pain or nonunion, as illustrated by contemporary case series and reports [^1142nT7G].

> For sacroiliac joint injury after a buttock fall, I should confirm that provocative maneuvers such as FABER, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen support the diagnosis, and that fluoroscopically guided diagnostic intra-articular injection can both confirm and provide therapeutic relief; best-practice guidance emphasizes a structured evaluation and the role of image-guided blocks in sacroiliac disorders [^1156wkVD] [^113earq1].

> For sciatic nerve injury or compression, I need to ensure I distinguish deep gluteal syndrome from radiculopathy; MRI of the pelvis and hip can identify piriformis hypertrophy, anomalous sciatic nerve course, or space-occupying lesions, and electrodiagnostics can help when the picture is unclear; initial management is conservative with NSAIDs, activity modification, and physical therapy focused on hip abductor/external rotator strengthening and movement retraining, reserving image-guided injections or surgery for refractory cases [^114Pp8ZA] [^111xZWFd].

> For ischiogluteal bursitis, let me verify that maximal tenderness over the ischial tuberosity and pain with sitting are classic, and that image-guided corticosteroid injection can be both diagnostic and therapeutic when the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms persist despite conservative care [^117DzC8a].

> For Morel-Lavallée lesion, I should confirm that MRI demonstrates a complex fluid collection along fascial planes and that early recognition prevents chronic drainage; treatment ranges from compression and observation to aspiration or surgical debridement depending on size, chronicity, and symptoms [^111nEFfB].

> For lumbar facet–mediated referred buttock pain, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; facet pain can mimic sciatica but typically lacks a clear radicular pattern and may be provoked by extension-rotation; diagnostic medial branch blocks can clarify, and management may include radiofrequency ablation when conservative therapy fails, recognizing that clinical diagnosis alone is limited [^112T9vTd] [^116hsNDS].

> I should double-check that initial management across categories prioritizes analgesia, protected weight bearing as indicated, and early mobilization once fracture is excluded, with orthopedics or sports medicine follow-up for persistent pain; in older adults, I need to assess fall risk, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation status because these influence imaging choices, procedural risk, and rehabilitation planning [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and escalation triggers. If pain remains severe beyond 7–10 days, new neurologic deficits appear, or weight bearing does not improve as expected, I need to repeat imaging, typically with MRI, and reconsider the working diagnosis; if infection or malignancy is suspected based on systemic features or atypical imaging, I must escalate to targeted labs and biopsy as indicated [^115UUvFS] [^112bGxwe].

> But wait, what if the patient is on anticoagulation or has a high suspicion for vascular injury; in that scenario, I should confirm that CT angiography or dedicated vascular imaging is obtained promptly when a pulsatile mass, expanding hematoma, or distal ischemia is present, because gluteal artery pseudoaneurysm and other vascular lesions, though rare, require urgent intervention [^117Jv7q2].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aligned pathway: screen for red flags, elicit mechanism-specific history, perform a targeted exam to localize hip, sacroiliac, lumbar, and soft-tissue sources, start with plain radiographs but escalate to MRI when suspicion remains high, and manage along a tiered differential that includes fracture, sacroiliac, sciatic compression, bursitis, Morel-Lavallée, and referred lumbar pain, with early mobilization and timely follow-up to prevent missed injuries and chronic pain syndromes [^111YfF3U] [^112bGxwe] [^115UUvFS].

Right buttock pain after a fall is most often due to **contusion or hematoma** of the gluteal muscles, but clinicians must also consider **sacral or pelvic fractures**, **sciatic nerve injury**, and **soft-tissue injuries** such as bursitis or muscle strain [^1123hkUK] [^1142nT7G] [^113wBi4P] [^117DzC8a]. Initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical exam, and **plain radiographs** of the pelvis/hip; if radiographs are normal but suspicion for fracture remains, obtain an **MRI** [^111YfF3U] [^112bGxwe]. Management is typically conservative (rest, ice, analgesia, physical therapy), but **surgical referral** is indicated for displaced fractures, persistent neurologic deficits, or infection [^1142nT7G] [^113wBi4P] [^1172DDKK].

---

## Common causes of right buttock pain after a fall

### Soft-tissue injuries

- **Contusion or hematoma**: Bruising or bleeding within the gluteal muscles is common after a direct blow; presents with localized pain, swelling, and ecchymosis.

- **Muscle strain**: Gluteal or hamstring strains cause pain with movement and palpable tenderness.

- **Morel-Lavallée lesion**: A closed degloving injury with hematoma and lymphatic disruption; presents as a fluctuant mass with induration [^notfound].

---

### Skeletal injuries

- **Sacral fracture**: Often insufficiency fractures in older adults; presents with buttock pain, tenderness, and pain with sitting or movement [^notfound].

- **Pelvic ring fractures**: Ischial or pubic rami fractures cause buttock pain and difficulty weight-bearing [^notfound].

- **Femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture**: May present with buttock or groin pain and inability to bear weight [^1123hkUK].

---

### Neurological injuries

Neurological injuries include **sciatic nerve injury** — either direct contusion or compression (e.g. piriformis syndrome) — presenting with buttock pain radiating down the leg, sensory changes, and weakness [^1165htFE], and **nerve entrapment** (superior cluneal or pudendal), causing localized buttock pain with possible radiation [^112ncuck].

---

### Other potential causes

Other potential causes include **sacroiliac joint injury**, in which trauma or shear forces cause buttock pain with SIJ provocation tests [^1111JAbu], and **infection or abscess**, which is rare but may present with buttock pain, fever, and systemic symptoms [^112Pw1fd].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the **pain** — onset, location, radiation, severity, and aggravating/relieving factors — and document the **mechanism of injury** (direct blow, fall height, body position). Screen for **red flags** — inability to bear weight, severe night pain, fever, neurologic deficits, or rapidly expanding mass [^111YfF3U].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Ecchymosis, swelling, deformity, skin changes.

- **Palpation**: Tenderness over ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, sacrum, or SIJ.

- **Range of motion**: Limited hip motion, pain with FABER, Gaenslen, or thigh thrust.

- **Neurologic exam**: Motor strength, sensory deficits, reflexes, straight leg raise.

---

## Diagnostic imaging

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Plain radiographs | Initial imaging after fall; suspected fracture | - Fracture lines <br/> - Displacement <br/> - Osteoporosis |
| MRI | Suspected occult fracture, soft-tissue injury, or neurologic involvement | - Bone marrow edema <br/> - Fracture lines <br/> - Hematoma <br/> - Nerve compression |
| CT scan | Complex fractures, surgical planning | Detailed bony anatomy, displacement |
| Ultrasound | Soft-tissue hematoma, abscess, or Morel-Lavallée lesion | - Fluid collections <br/> - Hematoma <br/> - Abscess |

---

MRI is the **gold standard** for occult fractures and soft-tissue injuries when radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion remains high [^115JTzsG].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid weight-bearing until pain improves.

- **Ice and elevation**: Reduce swelling and inflammation.

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen; opioids for severe pain short-term.

- **Physical therapy**: Gradual rehabilitation focusing on hip mobility, strength, and gait training.

- **Injection therapy**: Corticosteroid injections for bursitis or persistent pain [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management is indicated for **displaced fractures** (pelvic ring, femoral neck, or intertrochanteric), which often require open reduction and internal fixation [^notfound], and for **persistent neurologic deficits** due to nerve compression or injury, which may necessitate decompression or neurolysis [^111xZWFd]. Evacuation or debridement is indicated for **large hematomas, abscesses, or Morel-Lavallée lesions** [^111nEFfB].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **chronic pain** from untreated fractures or nerve injuries, **neurologic deficits** due to permanent nerve damage, and **infection** from hematoma or soft-tissue injury. Delayed healing may occur with inadequate immobilization or rehabilitation.

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Recovery depends on injury severity and patient factors. Soft-tissue injuries typically heal within **2–6 weeks** with conservative care, whereas fractures generally require **6–12 weeks** for healing, with longer durations for complex or displaced injuries. Neurologic injuries may recover over **weeks to months**, though some deficits may persist.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include **fall risk assessment** with balance and strength training, home modifications to remove hazards, and osteoporosis management with calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates as indicated. Patient education on safe movement and protective strategies further reduces recurrence risk.

---

Right buttock pain after a fall has a broad differential; a **structured evaluation** with targeted imaging and appropriate conservative or surgical care yields the best outcomes.

### An 80-year-old man with left groin pain [^115HNa91]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of an 80-year-old man with progressively worsening left groin pain following a fall 1 week prior to presentation. Using questions, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Hip fractures in adults [^1123hkUK]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with hip fracture typically present to the emergency department or their physician's office after a fall. They are often unable to walk, and they may exhibit shortening and external rotation of the affected limb. Frequently, they have hip pain. In some instances, however, patients with hip fracture may complain only of vague pain in their buttocks, knees, thighs, groin, or back. Their ability to walk may be unaffected, and initial radiographic findings may be indeterminate. In these patients, additional studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging or bone scanning, may be necessary to confirm the presence of hip fracture. A high index of suspicion often is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment of an occult hip fracture. Even when a patient is able to walk and has no documented trauma, localized hip pain, or typical shortening and malrotation deformity, the family physician should be alert to the possibility of hip fracture, particularly in a patient who is older than 65 years, presents with nonspecific leg discomfort, and complains of difficulty bearing weight on the affected limb. A heightened suspicion for hip fracture should lead to further diagnostic evaluation, especially if the patient has additional risk factors, such as use of a complicated drug regimen, impaired vision, physical or neurologic impairment, or comorbid condition (e.g., osteoporosis, malignancy). When hip fracture is detected early, appropriate treatment can minimize morbidity and mortality and prevent the rapid decline in quality of life that often is associated with this injury.

### Buttock pain: a missed diagnosis [^1137kBf1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old school boy presented with right-sided buttock pain, features of sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus positive blood cultures. On examination, he was febrile and in severe pain, with limited hip rotation and positive sacroiliac stress tests. Initial imaging with pelvic x-ray, hip ultrasound and MRI were normal. Despite this, a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the hip was presumed, and the patient underwent a washout of the right hip. When the imaging was reviewed in more detail, it was noted that a section of the sacroiliac joint was abnormal. Subsequent pelvic MRI confirmed that this was, in fact, septic sacroiliitis. The patient made a good recovery following washout of the right sacroiliac joint and 6 weeks of antibiotics.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115tgnSQ]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

Relevant History

The patient is a 90-year-old female with past medical history including a left sacral insufficiency fracture, thoracic vertebral compression fracture, and degenerative left medial meniscus tear, who presented with stabbing left lateral hip pain. The pain was chronic but had been progressing in severity over the past month. There was no inciting event or fall. The pain was exacerbated by lying on her left side and was affecting her sleep. At baseline, she ambulated with a rollator walker, but the pain was starting to limit her ability to walk. She had a history of low back and posterior left buttock pain, but she denied current pain in these regions. She also denied weakness or pain radiation into her lower extremities.

Relevant Physical Examination

On examination, she had no pain with lumbar or hip range of motion. She had full, symmetric, and pain-free lower extremity strength, and deep tendon reflexes and sensation to light touch were intact and symmetric in her lower extremities. She had a positive Trendelenburg sign with single-leg stance bilaterally, and she was tender to palpation over the left greater trochanter but not the right. Ober's, seated slump, and straight leg raise tests were negative. (See Figures 2 and 4 for descriptions of Ober's and the seated slump test.)

Figure 2
Ober's test: 1) The patient is positioned side-lying, and the leg to be tested is on top; the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand; 2) The knee of the affected leg is passively flexed to 90°, and then the hip is passively stretched through abduction and extension (to position the iliotibial band behind the greater trochanter) by the examiner; (A) shows the view from above and (B) shows the anterior perspective; 3) The knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop by gravity until reaching its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0° when compared to the plane of the table (i.e. the hip is still abducted), Ober's test is positive; (C) highlights a negative Ober's test.

Imaging

Focused ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal physiatrist with ultrasound training revealed evidence of bursitis of the left greater trochanter, which correlated with the patient's point of maximal tenderness.

### Sacroiliac joint syndrome [^1159DkvJ]. Pain Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint has long been considered to be a potential source of low back and/or buttock pain with or without lower extremity symptoms. Until recently, supportive evidence for this disorder has been empirical as it was solely derived from information garnered from patients who obtained successful treatment for a constellation of signs, symptoms and examination findings believed to be indicative of sacroiliac joint syndrome. Due to this fallacious reasoning, successful treatment denotes a correct diagnosis; many of the concepts espoused during the past few decades have been predicated upon spurious data. With the advent of and systematic utilization of fluoroscopically guided diagnostic sacroiliac joint blockade specific epidemiologic, symptomatic, examination, diagnostic, and outcome data have been derived. This review describes current concepts and provides information that expounds and, in some instances, supplants prior held notions about this disorder.

### Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm presenting as buttock pain [^114Ni1sV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

This is the first case report of a ruptured aortic aneurysm presenting with acute right buttock pain. The patient was an 80 year old man. A literature search revealed one report of ruptured internal iliac artery aneurysm presenting with acute hip pain and another of an unruptured aortic aneurysm presenting with chronic hip pain. Thus the present case is another unusual presentation of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and highlights the importance of careful history taking and clinical examination. A high index of clinical suspicion of aneurysm rupture should be maintained in elderly patients presenting with a history of collapse.

### Superior cluneal nerve entrapment syndrome: thought to be spondylolysis [^114b5cTu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient Information

A 14-year-old Caucasian adolescent girl presented to our institution's pediatric spine clinic for evaluation of chronic right lower back pain. According to her, the pain began a year ago but was exacerbated after a recent fall onto her right side. Three days before her arrival at the clinic, she presented to the emergency department with extreme pain in her right lower back. She described the pain as constant, aching, stabbing, and sharp. The flare-up in symptoms was present for over 2 weeks, and the severity was rated 6 of 10. She also stated that the pain radiated into her right buttock and right hip. It was aggravated with increased physical activity, standing for long periods, hyperextending her back, lying flat, and bending over. Conversely, it somewhat relieved with decreased physical activity. Previously, she unsuccessfully tried to manage the pain with chiropractic care, NSAIDs, lidocaine patches, rest, heat, and ice. Her mother reported that after her fall, she took her daughter to the emergency department, where a lumbar CT scan revealed a left-sided L5 spondylolysis (Figures 3 and 4).

### The 'nightstick' ischial fracture: a unique oddity of the pelvic injury family [^1142nT7G]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present an unusual ischial fracture unreported in the literature. We discuss the mechanism and describe the appropriate investigations and surgical management of this fracture. A 36-year-old man sustained a direct blow to his right buttock following a fall from a dirt bike. Examination revealed a firm haematoma, with severe pain on any stretch involving the posterior compartment of the thigh. Radiographs revealed a displaced fracture of the ischial body. CT confirmed integrity of the pelvic ring. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with a partially threaded cannulated screw via a 'modified longitudinal' posterior approach to the ischium. The patient was managed partially weight-bearing for 6 weeks; 6-month follow-up confirmed satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinicians should be aware of this novel pelvic fracture and its unusual presentation, currently not included in any pelvic fracture classification system. We report a novel operative technique for appropriate surgical management of such injuries.

### Traumatic venous varix causing sciatic neuropathy: case report [^113wBi4P]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Sciatic neuropathy rarely presents in nonpenetrating trauma because of protection of the nerve by the pelvis, the gluteal muscles, and the tissues in the posterior thigh. We present the case of a patient who fell and subsequently developed a traumatic venous varix of the inferior gluteal vein that caused compression sciatic neuropathy.

Clinical Presentation

Seven days after a fall onto her right buttock, the patient developed a painful burning paresthesia in her leg and numbness on the dorsum of her foot. Numerous studies ruled out lumbar spine pathological abnormalities as the cause of the pain. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion adjacent to the sciatic nerve. Gradient echo and two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging sequences confirmed this to be a vascular lesion originating from the inferior gluteal vein and compressing the sciatic nerve.

Intervention

Operative resection obliterated the venous varix, thereby relieving the patient's pain and neurological deficit.

Conclusion

No case of a traumatic venous varix of the inferior gluteal vein compressing the sciatic nerve has been reported to date. Surgical resection was successful in obliterating the lesion and relieving the symptoms.

### Piriformis syndrome: a real pain in the buttock? [^113FeAc4]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein, we provide an unbiased review of piriformis syndrome (PS), a highly controversial syndrome for which no consensus exists regarding diagnostic criteria or pathophysiology.

Methods

A review of the literature in the English language.

Results

A nonpartisan review of the medical literature pertaining to PS revealed that the existence of this entity remains controversial. There is no definitive proof of its existence despite reported series with large numbers of patients.

Conclusion

PS remains a controversial diagnosis for sciatic pain. The debate regarding the clinical significance of PS remains active. Nonetheless, there may be a subset of patients in whom the piriformis muscle is a source of pain. The syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unilateral lower extremity pain.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies may be a challenge because overlapping symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and, possibly, knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination should be performed in these patients to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies and diagnostic injections can be used to further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that, although one pathology is managed, the management of the other pathology may be necessary because of persistent pain. The recognition of both entities may help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the management of both entities in the appropriate sequence may help reduce the likelihood of persistent symptoms.

### Inciting events initiating injection-proven sacroiliac joint syndrome [^1111JAbu]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the inciting events leading to the development of sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS).

Methods

This was a retrospective descriptive cohort series from an academic interdisciplinary spine center. Consecutive patients presenting with low back or buttock pain with or without leg symptoms who met specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of SIJS were included in the study. Inciting events leading to the development of SIJS in these patients were categorized into traumatic, cumulative, and idiopathic events.

Results

Of 194 patients who were included in the study, 54 patients had symptom resolution with one or more therapeutic intraarticular sacroiliac joint injections, following a positive diagnostic injection. Those patients were given the diagnosis of SIJS. Of these, 24 (44%) had had a traumatic event (13 motor vehicle accidents, six falls onto the buttock, three immediately postpartum, one severe football tackle, and one pelvis fracture). Eleven (21%) patients were considered to have a cumulative injury (four lifting, two running, three altered gait due to lower extremity disorder, one crew training injury, and one forceful hip extension injury). Nineteen (35%) patients had spontaneous or idiopathic onset of sacroiliac joint pain.

Conclusion

SIJS can occur following a traumatic event or cumulative shear events, or can occur spontaneously.

### An elderly patient presenting with hip pain following a fall: an unusual presentation of necrotising fasciitis [^1172DDKK]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection involving necrosis of subcutaneous tissues. Early surgical intervention reduces mortality, but initial clinical findings are often non-specific and can delay the diagnosis. An 80-year-old patient, presented to our emergency department with pain in her left hip and mild bruising following a fall. An x-ray, requested to investigate a possible hip fracture, in fact demonstrated air in the subcutaneous tissues. She rapidly deteriorated and soon developed blood-filled blisters, crepitus and fixed staining of the skin. She underwent urgent debridement of involved tissues in theatre confirming the diagnosis of NF. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema on plain radiograph as in this case, is extremely specific to the diagnosis of NF. Although other imaging modalities can aid diagnosis these remain as an adjunct rather than a definitive diagnostic tool and should not delay surgical intervention based on clinical findings.

### Atypical subtrochanteric femoral fracture [^116o4Mov]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The patient was a 72-year-old woman who presented to an emergency department with a chief complaint of severe right thigh pain following a fall. Prior to the fall, the patient reported an 8-month history of worsening right thigh pain. The patient had a 4-year history of alendronate and calcium use to manage her osteoporosis. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) hip images taken 1 month prior to the patient's fracture demonstrated lateral cortical thickening in the subtrochanteric region of the femur. In retrospect, this finding was concerning for impending complete fracture. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2012;42(1):44. doi:10.2519/jospt.2012.0402.

### A pulsatile mass in the right buttock [^117Jv7q2]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Gluteal artery pseudoaneurysms are a rare cause of buttock pain, with few cases reported in the recent literature. Although small pseudoaneurysms are usually asymptomatic, larger can be painful and require treatment. Most of these cases are pseudoaneurysms resulting from local trauma. We report in this case a patient with a gluteal artery pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully thrombosed using ultrasound-guided thrombin injection. This article reviews the literature, discusses the imaging diagnostics and the treatment of gluteal artery aneurysms.

### Buttock pain and sciatica caused by a femoral osteochondroma [^111Btm5Q]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old woman was referred to physical therapy with lower back pain extending into the right buttock. Palpation of the right buttock revealed a firm, immobile mass of considerable size, which the patient identified as her locus of symptoms. Due to the noted palpable mass, her pain, her inability to sit normally, and the longevity of symptoms, the physical therapist ordered radiographs, which identified multiple osteochondromas. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(6):442. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.6877.

### Postpartum sacral stress fracture: an unusual case of low-back and buttock pain [^117SSb2F]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Low-back and buttock pain is a common complaint during pregnancy and the postpartum period and is usually attributable to mechanical lesions of the pelvis. Sacral stress fractures are unusual but important causes that should be considered in differential diagnosis. To date, only eight postpartum sacral stress fractures have been reported in the literature. A 32-yr-old woman presented with low-back and right buttock pain that started 15 days after uneventful cesarean section delivery. Imaging studies revealed a right sacral stress fracture. Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density were normal and, except for pregnancy and lactation, no risk factors for osteoporosis were identified. There was no history of trauma, excessive weight gain, strenuous physical activity, or contribution of mechanical factors. The question remains whether this is an insufficiency fracture or a fatigue fracture. Clinicians should consider sacral fracture during pregnancy and the postpartum period as a diagnostic possibility in patients with low-back and/or buttock pain.

### Low back pain [^114xrAM5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity pain — the ICD diagnosis of flatback syndrome or lumbago due to displacement of intervertebral disc and the associated ICF diagnosis are made with a reasonable level of certainty when the patient presents with low back pain commonly associated with referred buttock, thigh, or leg pain that worsens with flexion activities and sitting; low back and lower extremity pain that can be centralized and diminished with positioning, manual procedures, and/or repeated movements; and frequently lateral trunk shift, reduced lumbar lordosis, and limited lumbar extension mobility with clinical findings commonly present that align with the subacute or chronic low back pain with movement coordination impairments category.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^113earq1]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The treatment of SID is a complex and important matter in the management of patients with back, buttock and leg pain. The best practice of treating this disorder involves 1) An understanding of anatomy; 2) Proper history taking of factors suggesting this pathology; 3) An understanding of comorbid pathologies that can cause similar complaints; 4) An understanding of imaging and ruling out other significant disease processes; 5) An understanding of physical examination for SID; 6) An understanding of diagnostic injections and evaluation of response; 7) An understanding of the proper use and methods of neuroablative procedures; and 8) An understanding of the risk to benefit assessment of various methods of minimally invasive and surgical methods of SID treatment.

When each of these goals are met using best practices, the patient has the most likely chance of an optimal outcome with improvements in both safety and efficacy.

### Leg pain-an unexpected twist [^116BY8Us]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obturator hernia is a rare condition, often presenting with non-specific symptoms, such as thigh pain, groin pain, nausea, or vomiting. Obturator hernias are most common in thin, elderly women. Oftentimes, they are diagnosed late in the disease course resulting in complications and high morbidity and mortality.

Case Report

We present the case of a 75-year-old female who presented with right thigh pain with no other symptoms. After computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis, the patient was found to have an incarcerated obturator hernia complicated by a small bowel obstruction, ultimately requiring urgent surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Given the very general symptoms associated with the condition, the diagnosis of obturator hernia can easily be missed, leading to a delayed diagnosis, more complications, and a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Due to the risk associated with a delayed diagnosis, it is important for emergency physicians to maintain a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis.

### Spontaneous proximal migration of kuntscher nail: an uncommon complication [^114ucPzG]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The Kuntscher nail (K-nail) was initially designed with an axial section in the letter 'V' shape. Still, it was later reintroduced in a cloverleaf shape to achieve additional strength and easier use. Migration of the K-nail proximally or distally in the femur is a well-documented complication, with distal migration reported as one of the complications in the 1940s. However, spontaneous extrusion of the K-nail proximally is a rare complication. The common causes of the extrusion include disuse/senile osteoporosis, infection, inappropriate K-nail size, delayed union with shortening and premature weight bearing. A woman in her early 80s presented with a history of a fall 3months ago. She had pain in the left hip and was unable to bear weight. She was diagnosed with a left neck of femur fracture. On the right side, she had a femur shaft fracture for which K-nailing was done 11 years ago. She started feeling the implant in her right buttock for 3 years but did not seek medical advice and was able to do her routine activities. She underwent implant removal on the right side with left hip hemiarthroplasty. Spontaneous migration of the K-nail proximally is an uncommon presentation. It is suggested that K-nails be routinely removed as soon as union and consolidation of the fracture are achieved radiologically.

A 42-year-old woman, who had received a radiologic diagnosis of synovial osteochondromatosis many years before, was examined for a painful right hip and a large immobile mass in the right buttock. Findings of radiologic and scintigraphic imaging were consistent with synovial osteochondromatosis. The patient underwent arthrotomy and excision of the large mass and several smaller masses to control pain and to identify possible malignant change.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain [^115JTzsG]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Patients often express that their hip pain is localized to one of three anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip. Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology, such as osteoarthritis and hip labral tears. Posterior hip pain is associated with piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy, and less commonly ischiofemoral impingement and vascular claudication. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Clinical examination tests, although helpful, are not highly sensitive or specific for most diagnoses; however, a rational approach to the hip examination can be used. Radiography should be performed if acute fracture, dislocations, or stress fractures are suspected. Initial plain radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if the history and plain radiograph results are not diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for the detection of occult traumatic fractures, stress fractures, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Magnetic resonance arthrography is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.

### Sciatica-like symptoms and the sacroiliac joint: clinical features and differential diagnosis [^114Xftp5]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the clinical features of patients with sacroiliac joint (SIJ)-related sciatica-like symptoms to those with sciatica from nerve root compression and to investigate the necessity to perform radiological imaging in patients with sciatica-like symptoms derived from the SIJ.

Methods

Patients with pain radiating below the buttocks with a duration of 4 weeks to 1 year were included. After physical and radiological examinations, a diagnosis of SI joint-related pain, pain due to disk herniation, or a combination of these two causes was made.

Results

Patients with SIJ-related leg pain (n = 77/186) were significantly more often female, had shorter statue, a shorter duration of symptoms, and had more often pain radiating to the groin and a history of a fall on the buttocks. Muscle weakness, corkscrew phenomenon, finger-floor distance ≥ 25 cm, lumbar scoliosis, positive Bragard or Kemp sign, and positive leg raising test were more often present when radiologic nerve root compression was present. Although these investigations may help, MRI of the spine is necessary to discriminate between the groups.

Conclusions

Sciatica-like symptoms derived from the SIJ can clinically mimic a radiculopathy. We suggest to perform a thorough physical examination of the spine, SI joints, and hips with additional radiological tests to exclude other causes.

### Morel-lavallee lesion in children [^111nEFfB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Based on a review of the literature, MLL occurs predominantly in patients in their 30s-40s. To our knowledge, only rare cases of MLL occur in children (Table 1). Letts reviewed 16 pediatric cases of degloving injuries and analyzed the causes and sites of injury. This author classified degloving injuries into those involving anatomical degloving (gloving injuries with skin surface disruption) and those involving physiological degloving (degloving injuries with disruption of the underlying skin vasculature without skin surface disruption). Six of the studied patients suffered from physiologic degloving injuries due to train or motor vehicle accidents involving the leg, buttock and back; the mean age of these six patients was 11 years (range, 6–14 years). All six patients, most of whom received defatted skin grafts, had a concurrent anatomical degloving injury. Harma et al. reported five pediatric cases of MLL, of which two were due to automobile crashes. These authors treated a 6-year-old patient with conservative management and a 14-year-old patient with debridement and local flap coverage. In addition, Mukherjee et al. reported a case of MLL in a 14-year-old boy who presented with a soft tissue mass on the right greater trochanter. For this patient, no data were available regarding a possible past history of trauma or the duration of symptoms. Therefore, these authors made a diagnosis of MLL based solely on ultrasonography and MRI scans. They treated the patient with conservative management with elastic compression bandages. Carlson et al. treated 22 patients with MLL, two of whom were pediatric cases, with debridement and dead space closure. Both of the pediatric cases were caused by motor vehicle accident and were treated immediately after the onset of injury. Choudhary et al. reported a case of a 12-year-old boy who presented with thigh swelling and blistering two weeks after sustaining an injury while riding an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Based on ultrasonography, the patient was diagnosed with MLL and treated with sotradechol foam injection and doxycycline. This patient had no traumatic lesions in the early stage of injury, but gradually presented with symptoms. An imaging study played a key role in making a diagnosis of MLL in this patient. Anakwez et al. reported a case of MLL that occurred following a knee injury caused by falling on asphalt during a football game. The patient presented with pain and bruising of the knee and thigh but had no notable orthopedic symptoms on physical and radiological examination. Two weeks later, however, the patient exhibited localized bruises and blisters and, based on the results of MRI scans, was subsequently diagnosed with MLL. Aspiration was attempted, but drainage was unsuccessful. The patient was managed conservatively with compression dressings and physical therapy. Most recently, Efrimescu et al. reported a case of MLL in a 14-year-old boy. The patient presented with pain and swelling after the onset of blunt trauma to the lower back and was diagnosed with MLL after simple radiography and MRI. This patient was managed with open drainage.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease — alternative diagnoses for leg pain or claudication with normal physiological testing (Not PAD-Related) are enumerated with characteristic patterns. Symptomatic Baker's cyst is "Behind knee, down calf", has "Swelling, tenderness", occurs "With exercise", is "Also present at rest", and is "Not intermittent". Venous claudication involves the "Entire leg, worse in calf", with "Tight, bursting pain" "After walking" that "Subsides slowly", relief "speeded by elevation", and a "History of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis; edema; signs of venous stasis". Chronic compartment syndrome affects the "Calf muscles" with "Tight, bursting pain" "After much exercise (jogging)", that "Subsides very slowly", with "Relief with rest", and occurs in "Typically heavy muscled athletes". Spinal stenosis presents in "Often bilateral buttocks, posterior leg" with "Pain and weakness", may "mimic claudication", has "Variable relief but can take a long time to recover", improves with "Relief by lumbar spine flexion", and is "Worse with standing and extending spine". Nerve root compression pain "Radiates down leg", is "Sharp lancinating pain", is "Induced by sitting, standing, or walking", is "Often present at rest", "Improved by change in position", with a "History of back problems; worse with sitting; relief when supine or sitting". Hip arthritis produces "Aching discomfort" in the "Lateral hip, thigh" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and is "Improved when not weight bearing", with "history of degenerative arthritis". Foot/ankle arthritis causes "Aching pain" in the "Ankle, foot, arch" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and "May be relieved by not weight bearing", with symptoms that "may be related to activity level or present at rest".

### Granulocytic sarcoma: a rare cause of sciatica [^112V3W2N]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A man aged 56 years presented to the emergency department with a 4-month history of right buttock pain radiating down the right leg treated as sciatica in the community. Two weeks prior to admission, the pain had worsened to the extent that he needed a walking stick to mobilise. He had also developed nocturnal pain and allodynia throughout the outer aspect of the right leg and noticed a tender lump in his right buttock. This had not been present on previous visits to his general practitioner, but on discovery, he was promptly referred to the emergency department for further assessment.

He developed myelodysplastic syndrome (RAEB-2) aged 49 and underwent chemotherapy (daunorubicin+cytarabine) and allogeneic bone marrow transplant. This subsequently failed and he required more chemotherapy (FLAG-Ida+cytarabine) and a second allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He had been in remission until the time of presentation.

On examination, a hard, smooth tender mass was palpable in the upper half of the right buttock. The posterolateral aspect of his right buttock and thigh were very painful to touch. He had weak right knee flexion with total loss of movement in the ankle and on knee extension. The right ankle reflex was absent. The left lower limb was neurologically normal. The SLR test was negative bilaterally. Admission blood test results are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Blood results on admission

An MRI of the lumbar spine performed 6 weeks prior to admission had shown mild lumbar disc protrusions at L3/4 and L5/S1 with a disc prolapse at L4/5. There was no evidence of significant neurological compromise or bone marrow abnormality. On admission, after detecting the buttock mass on clinical examination, an informal ultrasound scan was performed in the emergency department and showed a 4×10 cm heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the right buttock (figure 1). Subsequent MRI of the right buttock revealed a heterogenous enhancing soft tissue mass lesion along the right lateral wall of the pelvis extending through the sciatic and obturator foramina into the thigh and engulfing the lumbosacral plexus measuring 18×12×10 cm (figure 2 A, B). A second mass lesion involving the gluteal muscles was also identified and seen to communicate with the pelvic mass. Unfortunately, the first MRI examination of the lumbar spine did not extend caudally enough to capture the mass, leading to a delay in diagnosis.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117DzC8a]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.6.2 Ischiofemoral impingement

In this condition, patients experience pain arising from compression of the quadratus femoris muscle between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter of femur. Clinically, patients present with gradual onset of posterior and/or posteromedial buttock pain with or without radiation to the posterior thigh that is worse with hip extension, adduction, and external rotation. A positive long stride walking test is supportive of the diagnosis.MRI to evaluate for signs of focal edema in the quadratus femoris muscle can aid in diagnosis.

4.6.3 Ischiogluteal bursitis

Often termed a "pain in the arse" for its clinical symptoms and difficulty to diagnose, ischiogluteal bursitis presents with central buttock pain that radiates down the posterior thigh. The precise epidemiology is unknown. Experts have long opined that ischiogluteal bursitis, also referred to as weavers' bottom, is rare but likely underdiagnosed, in part because it is easily confused for a variety of other conditions, including soft tissue tumors and radiculopathy. Ischiogluteal bursitis refers to inflammation of the ischial bursa, which lies between the ischial tuberosity and gluteus maximus muscle in standing, and between the ischial tuberosity and the skin in sitting.

On history, patients may report pain that is excruciating when sitting and patients may report being unable to sit. Ischiogluteal bursitis develops at the ischial tuberosity, where the hamstring tendons originate, and so patients may also report pain with actions that involve hamstring contraction, such as running, jumping, or kicking. On physical examination, the vast majority of patients will present with pain reproducible by palpating the ischial tuberosity (Figure 2). Diagnosis may be difficult to make clinically, and experts advocate for image‐guided diagnostic/therapeutic injection, US, or MRI to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### A case of enteroviral meningoencephalitis presenting as rapidly progressive dementia [^114ZXDFY]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

A 70-year-old immunocompetent male presented to a memory disorders clinic with a 7-month illness that had begun with somatic complaints including transient right temporal head pain, left buttock pain, and right conjunctival injection. About 3 months after the first signs of illness, the patient had begun to develop insidious cognitive and behavioral decline, which progressed most rapidly in the 2 months before presentation. An assessment completed during hospitalization for intermittent fevers and confusion had not revealed an infectious etiology, although mild pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid had been noted. Upon presentation to the memory disorders clinic, the patient was disoriented, distractible, laughed at inappropriate moments, and followed only one-step commands. He had hypophonic speech and had mildly increased axial tone. He scored 5 out of 30 on the Mini Mental State Examination and was admitted for expedited evaluation.

Investigations

Physical examination, brain MRI, electroencephalogram, lumbar puncture, autoimmune and paraneoplastic testing, cerebral angiogram, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, enterovirus group-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, and RNA sequencing in brain biopsy samples.

Diagnosis

Enteroviral meningoencephalitis.

Management

Intravenous steroids with oral taper and intravenous immunoglobulin.

### Activity of daily living impairment mediates the relationship between pain and falls in Chinese older adults: a cohort study [^113nxwns]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We conducted a prospective cohort study using the 2018 survey as baseline and the 2020 survey as follow-up. Participants were included if they completed the 2018 survey. We excluded individuals who (1) lacked 2020 follow-up data; (2) were younger than 60 years at baseline; (3) resided in institutions (e.g. nursing homes or hospitals) at baseline; (4) had missing ADL data; (5) had missing fall data at baseline or follow-up; and (6) lacked information on physician-diagnosed conditions. After applying these criteria, 6,280 participants remained for analysis. The participant flow chart is presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of sample selection and the exclusion criteria

Falls

As the outcome variable, falls were ascertained from the 2020 follow-up survey. Participants were asked: "Since the last interview, have you experienced a fall?" Responses were recorded as either "yes" or "no". For this study, participants were classified as having experienced a fall if they answered "yes" to the question.

Pain

Pain data was derived from the 2018 survey. Participants were initially asked: "How often do you suffer from physical pain?" with response options of "none", "a little", "somewhat", "quite a bit", or "very". If participants reported experiencing pain (i.e. responded with "a little", "somewhat", "quite a bit", or "very"), they were further asked to identify the specific body parts where they experienced pain. The options included: head, shoulders, arms, wrists, fingers, chest, stomach, upper back, lower back, buttocks, legs, knees, ankles, toes, neck, and other. Two pain variables were included in the analysis: pain frequency (PF), the number of pain sites (NPS). PF was defined based on participants' initial responses regarding the frequency of pain. NPS was determined by the number of specific pain sites identified by participants.

### Sacral plexus disorder caused by a wooden toothpick in the rectum [^1159JpoL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of pain in his right buttock and lower limb. MRI depicted right L5/S1 lateral recess stenosis requiring surgical treatment; however, preoperative CT showed an approximately 7 cm long, thin, rod-shaped structure in the rectum, which was ultimately determined to be an accidentally ingested toothpick. It was removed surgically 6days after diagnosis, because right leg pain worsened rapidly. The pain disappeared thereafter, and the symptoms have not recurred since. The pain might have been localised to the right buttock and posterior thigh in the early stages because the fine tip of the toothpick was positioned to the right of the anterior ramus of the S2 spinal nerve. Although sacral plexus disorder caused by a rectal foreign body is extremely rare, physicians should be mindful to avoid misdiagnosis.

### A case of penile calciphylaxis development shortly after initiation of dialysis for graft dysfunction following living donor kidney transplantation: a case report [^117QVfA1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Calciphylaxis was first described in 1962 by Selye et al. as a condition predominantly observed in patients undergoing dialysis. The pathophysiology of calciphylaxis involves medial calcification, thrombosis, and occlusion of the small arterioles, resulting in impaired blood flow to the subcutaneous adipose tissue and dermis. This leads to tissue hypoxia, skin necrosis, and painful ulceration. In this case, the patient experienced intractable pain that was unresponsive to acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and fentanyl patches, and required the use of tramadol, mirogabalin, and ketamine. Despite these measures, agitation and frequent falls due to severe pain led to a right femoral trochanteric fracture. The pain was alleviated after penectomy.

Calciphylaxis commonly affects the abdomen, buttocks, and lower extremities. Penile involvement is extremely rare. A 2023 review identified approximately 121 cases of penile calciphylaxis reported in the literature. Ischemic necrosis of the penis is rare because of its rich blood supply from the dorsal, deep, and urethral arteries. Penile calciphylaxis has a median onset of 48 months (IQR, 24–96 months) after dialysis initiation and a high mortality rate of 47.8%, with a mean time to death of 3 months. In the present case, a retrospective review of serial CT images demonstrated progressive calcification of the bilateral dorsal and deep penile arteries (Fig. 3). The patient also had systemic vascular calcifications, including chronic limb-threatening ischemia and coronary artery disease, suggesting more widespread calcification contributing to the development of penile calciphylaxis.

### Piriformis syndrome and low back pain: a new classification and review of the literature [^115uf7VV]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is a common cause of low back pain. It is often not included in the differential diagnosis of back, buttock, and leg pain. Additionally it has received minimal recognition because it is often seen as a diagnosis of exclusion. Familiarity with the common elements of the syndrome should increase its recognition and facilitate the appropriate treatment. These include buttock pain and tenderness with or without electrodiagnostic or neurologic signs. Pain is exacerbated in prolonged sitting. Specific physical findings are tenderness in the sciatic notch and buttock pain in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) of the hip. Imaging modalities are rarely helpful, but electrophysiologic studies should confirm the diagnosis, if not immediately, then certainly in a patient re-evaluation and as such should be sought persistently. Physical therapy aims at stretching the muscle and reducing the vicious cycle of pain and spasm. It is a mainstay of conservative treatment, usually enhanced by local injections. Surgery should be reserved as a last resort in case of failure of all conservative modalities. Piriformis syndrome may constitute up to 5% of cases of low back, buttock, and leg pain. Recognition and widespread appreciation of the clinical presentation improves its early detection and accurate treatment.

### Psoas abscess and severe fasciitis due to a caecal carcinoma [^112Pw1fd]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A man in his mid-50s presented with a painful and swollen right thigh and buttock. This was accompanied by a month long history of flank pain, back pain, vague abdominal pain, limp, fever and weight loss. On examination, there was extensive erythaema, heat, tenderness, oedema and crepitus over his right buttock and thigh. The patient was referred to plastic surgery to exclude necrotising fasciitis of the gluteal and thigh region. After CT imaging, a psoas abscess (PA) and caecal mass were identified. Subsequent right hemicolectomy, PA drainage and debridement of his right thigh were performed. This case reminds clinicians of the many non-specific ways a PA can present and that a high level of suspicion assists in making a timely diagnosis.

### Acute traumatic thoracolumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome: case report [^114ffi1b]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Although compartment syndrome can occur in any compartment in the body, it rarely occurs in the paraspinal musculature and has therefore only been reported in a few case reports. Despite its rare occurrence, acute paraspinal compartment syndrome has been shown to occur secondary to reperfusion injury and traumatic and atraumatic causes. Diagnosis can be based on clinical examination findings, MRI or CT studies, or through direct measurement of intramuscular pressures. Conservative management should only be used in the setting of chronic presentation. Operative decompression via fasciotomy in cases of acute presentation may improve the patient's symptoms and outcomes. When treating acute paraspinal compartment syndrome via surgical decompression, an important aspect is the anatomical consideration. Although grouped under one name, each paraspinal muscle is enclosed within its own fascial compartment, all of which must be addressed to achieve an adequate decompression. The authors present the case of a 43-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with increasing low-back and flank pain after a fall. Associated sensory deficits in a cutaneous distribution combined with imaging and clinical findings contributed to the diagnosis of acute traumatic paraspinal compartment syndrome. The authors discuss this case and describe their surgical technique for managing acute paraspinal compartment syndrome.

Case Report

Note: The patient described in this report provided written consent prior to the initiation of the writing of the manuscript to have the details of his treatment and accompanying images published.

A 95-year-old male, VV, with a past medical history notable for prostate cancer managed with leuprolide as well as osteoporosis, initially presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Pain Medicine for evaluation of bilateral low back pain, which was worse on the right. His back pain had been present for approximately 1 year and reportedly began consequent to a compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body. The pain worsened in the setting of two additional compression fractures at L1 and L4 in the year prior to the initial pain clinic visit. Associated symptoms included bilateral hip pain, left buttock pain, and left anterolateral thigh numbness. He reported that his pain, which becomes quite severe with any activity, was having a significant impact on his ability to perform even basic activities of daily living. Eighteen months prior to the initial visit, he was able to ambulate independently without a walker and was also driving independently. By the time of the initial evaluation at our clinic, he required a walker to ambulate and was walking a maximum of 100 feet, and this only a few days per week. Additionally, he was leaving the house only for medical appointments, was no longer driving a car, and was sleeping in a hospital bed located in his living room as he could not ascend a flight of stairs to his bedroom. The patient stated that he had essentially no quality of life. His physical examination was notable for paraspinal and gluteal muscle tenderness to palpation, as well as exacerbation of his reported baseline pain with lumbar extension and rotation bilaterally. Neurologic examination of his lower extremities was unremarkable. MRI prior to initial visit, which had been obtained before the L4 compression fracture, was indicative of chronic compression fractures at L1 and L2, as well as multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and a grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4/L5 (Figure 1).

### Right-sided diaphragmatic hernia causing gastric outlet obstruction 1 month after trauma [^112eAtBF]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Diaphragmatic hernias arising from trauma are rare, and scarcely present in a delayed manner. This case report highlights a case of delayed presentation of a right-sided post-traumatic hernia in a woman in her early 70s following a fall. The aim of this report is to shed light on the diagnostic peculiarities and management. The woman presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and coffee-ground vomiting. This followed a fall a month ago. CT confirmed the diagnosis of a gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a right-sided diaphragmatic rupture. At surgery, the herniated abdominal contents were reduced, and the diaphragmatic defect was fixed. The postoperative recovery was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged on day 4. This case highlights that diaphragmatic hernias should be considered as differential diagnoses following recent trauma.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^116hsNDS]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and pain patterns

FJ as a source of LBP was first described by Goldthwaite in 1911, and Ghormhley who used the term "facet syndrome" to describe a symptom originating from the FJ. It was initially described as lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica in 1933. Ten years later, Badgley et al. suggested FJ as the source of up to 80% of back pain. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Most authors tried to classify the distribution of FJ pain provoked by an infiltration or electrical stimulation. The majority of these studies have not found reliable referral patterns of FJ pain. As suggested by Cohen, this may be explained by the fact that stimulation does not reproduce physiological conditions. FJ pain may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica. "Pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates uni- or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2 to L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits (Fig. 5). However, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain, especially in cases of osteophytes or synovial cysts. Claudication is possible. Pain is usually worse in the morning, during periods of inactivity, and following stress exercise, lumbar spine extension or rotary trunk motions, is provoked by standing or sitting positions, and may be elicited on FJ palpation. Pain radiation can be subdivided into primary, secondary and least commonly painful areas as previously described by Barlocher et al. Abdominal and pelvic pain have also been described. Differential diagnoses include true sciatica, hip pathology (hip osteoarthritis or greater trochanteric bursitis) or sacroiliac impairment. However, lumbar FJ syndrome seems not to be a reliable clinical diagnosis, and a specific etiology of back pain can be diagnosed in only about 15% of patients with certainty based on clinical examination alone. The results of studies investigating the FJ as the source of a patient's symptoms suggest that the currently available tests have limited or no diagnostic validity. Moreover, history and physical examination may suggest but not confirm FJ as the source of pain.

### Postpartum sacral stress fracture: a case report [^111SKdfE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old gravida 1, para 1 presented because of bilateral buttocks and low back pain that started 10 days postpartum. The pain was dull in nature, was more severe on the right side, and was progressively increasing in intensity resulting in a limping gait. Pain worsened with walking, bending, and minor activity and was partially relieved with rest. Patient self-prescribed analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which used to relief pain transiently.

The patient is otherwise healthy with no history of metabolic bone disease, menstrual irregularities, previous fractures, eating disorders, or strenuous athletic activity. No family history of osteoporosis was reported. The course of pregnancy was smooth with no remarkable back, hip, or buttocks pain reported. The total weight gained during pregnancy was 14 kg. She was maintained on supplemental iron, calcium (1000 mg daily), and vitamin D (800 international units (IU)) daily as of the second trimester. At term, she presented in labor and received epidural anesthesia. The first stage of labor was 7 h and second stage was 100 min. She had an uneventful, spontaneous, normal vaginal delivery without the need for forceps or vacuum application. The baby was healthy and weighed 3350 g.

Two weeks after onset of her symptoms, the patient sought medical attention because of persisting pain and abnormal gait. On physical exam, the patient was of average body habitus with height 164 cm and weight 60 kg. Mobility of the lumbosacral spine was within normal limits. Tenderness around the upper gluteal region and sacrum was noted bilaterally; more evident on the right side.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed to rule out soft tissue lesions, demonstrated moderate-to-severe bone marrow edema involving the right sacrum along its entire length with a non-displaced fracture line. Mild edema was also seen involving the left sacrum. Results of the MRI are displayed in Fig. 1a and b.

### A 5-year-old with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and leg pain [^113dc3Hs]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with fever, headache, fatigue, neck stiffness, and 2 episodes of nocturnal urinary incontinence, prompting a visit to the emergency department. He had experienced intermittent frontal headaches and leg and buttock pain for several months, which had worsened over the previous 2 weeks. His history was notable for a spinal hemangioma with vascular tract, but he was otherwise healthy. On examination, he was febrile and tachycardic. He held his neck slightly rotated to the right with limited range of motion in all directions due to pain. No focal neurologic deficits were noted, and sensation and deep tendon reflexes were intact bilaterally. He was able to bear weight on both legs. There was no spinal tenderness or limitation in range of motion of his back and hips. There were no cutaneous manifestations, including no sacral dimple. A complete blood count with differential revealed leukocytosis of 31.98 × 103/µL (78.6% neutrophils, 16% bands). C-reactive protein was elevated at 2.4 mg/dL (0–1 mg/dL), and serum electrolytes, liver function tests, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase were within normal limits for age. Blood cultures were obtained before admission. Here we present his case, diagnostic evaluation, ultimate diagnosis, and complications.

### Treatment of an individual with piriformis syndrome focusing on hip muscle strengthening and movement reeducation: a case report [^114J2G9X]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To describe an alternative treatment approach for piriformis syndrome using a hip muscle strengthening program with movement reeducation.

Background

Interventions for piriformis syndrome typically consist of stretching and/or soft tissue massage to the piriformis muscle. The premise underlying this approach is that a shortening or "spasm" of the piriformis is responsible for the compression placed upon the sciatic nerve.

Case Description

The patient was a 30-year-old male with right buttock and posterior thigh pain for 2 years. Clinical findings upon examination included reproduction of symptoms with palpation and stretching of the piriformis. Movement analysis during a single-limb step-down revealed excessive hip adduction and internal rotation, which reproduced his symptoms. Strength assessment revealed weakness of the right hip abductor and external rotator muscles. The patient's treatment was limited to hip-strengthening exercises and movement reeducation to correct the excessive hip adduction and internal rotation during functional tasks.

Outcomes

Following the intervention, the patient reported 0/10 pain with all activities. The initial Lower Extremity Functional Scale questionnaire score of 65/80 improved to 80/80. Lower extremity kinematics for peak hip adduction and internal rotation improved from 15.9 degrees and 12.8 degrees to 5.8 degrees and 5.9 degrees, respectively, during a step-down task.

Discussion

This case highlights an alternative view of the pathomechanics of piriformis syndrome (overstretching as opposed to overshortening) and illustrates the need for functional movement analysis as part of the examination of these patients.

### Scaphoid fracture in a patient after a fall [^1167mhD9]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The patient was a 27-year-old man who was referred to a physical therapist because of persistent right wrist pain after a fall on an outstretched hand in a remote setting 3 months prior. Immediately after the injury, the patient was seen by a physician's assistant in a remote medical clinic, where right wrist radiographs were completed and interpreted as normal. Based on the history and physical exam, a potential scaphoid fracture was suspected. Therefore, the physical therapist ordered radiographs of the right wrist, which revealed a fracture through the waist of the right scaphoid with a band-like lucency.

### Femoral diaphyseal fatigue stress fracture in an older adult male with normal bone mineral density [^116Mc9Zu]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Stress fractures can have varying degrees of associated adverse outcomes depending on the point of progression that diagnosis occurs and the management strategies implemented. Early diagnosis of stress fractures can allow the implementation of load-reduction strategies and addressing of contributing intrinsic and extrinsic factors to prevent progression to overt fracture, which has a significant downstream effect on patient prognosis and recovery. Early intervention can minimise healing timeframes, thereby optimising patient outcomes, such as minimising the patient's pain experience and inability to perform activities of daily living, decreasing the need for hospitalisation or surgical intervention and reducing potential loss of income. The presence of pain is a prevalent risk factor for recurrent falls in the elderly, and the ability to minimise or completely avoid significant levels of pain, particularly in elderly populations, can have a dramatic effect at preventing falls and the potentially devastating outcomes that can occur as a result. The most important aspect of a clinical diagnosis is a thorough clinical history. These points act to highlight the importance of consideration of stress fractures in patients who present with pain during weightbearing and bony tenderness in the absence of trauma. We recommend that suspicion for stress fracture should be considered for all patients presenting with pain on weightbearing or bony point-tenderness, regardless of epidemiology, and clinicians should carefully screen for activities of daily living that may cause repetitive loading of the affected limb.

Learning points

Patients of atypical demographic and lacking significant risk factors or typical clinical history are at a higher risk of missed diagnosis of stress fracture, particularly due to the poor sensitivity of plain radiography.
Patients presenting with pain on activity and point tenderness should have a thorough history taken to identify daily activities that involve repetitive loading that may increase suspicion for stress fracture to avoid missed diagnosis.
Thorough history, examination and investigation process is integral for patients with stress fractures as the diagnosis of the underlying category guides the appropriate treatment pathway.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in piriformis syndrome: a case report [^113ZNk7c]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an unusual cause of sciatica that, because of the lack of strict diagnostic criteria, remains a controversial clinical entity. The diagnosis of PS is still primarily clinical because no diagnostic tests have proven to be definitive. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman, affected by a severe scoliosis, who developed a persistent buttock pain resembling that of PS. The clinical suspicion was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis, which showed an enlargement of the left piriformis muscle with an anterior isplacement of the sciatic nerve. The role of MRI in the diagnosis, clinical definition, and therapeutic approach to PS is discussed.

### Superior cluneal nerve entrapment syndrome: thought to be spondylolysis [^112YhKnE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Assessment

Although the patient's imaging showed a left L5 pars defect, her clinical signs did not match the imaging. Her spondylolysis was located on the left, but her pain was on the right. In addition, the patient's pain was much more lateral on her back that would be expected with a spondylolysis. Furthermore, the radiating pain to the buttock and hip was suspicious for some form of neuropathy.

To further investigate the cause of her pain, the patient received a local injection of 1% lidocaine and 40 milligram depo-Medrol over the right iliac crest, seven centimeters to the right of midline. Six days after the steroid injection, her mother called reporting that the patient was still having notable pain in her right lower back. Therefore, the decision was made to explore the possibility that the pain was from the pars defect, and an order for steroid injection by interventional radiology over the left L5 pars defect was placed. She underwent this 3 weeks after the initial clinic visit (Figure 5). Three days after the L5 pars defect injection, her mother called stating that the patient's pain was worse. Finally, when the patient and her mother returned to the clinic, the timeline of her pain response was clarified for each steroid injection. Her mother reported that for the initial injection, the day after she called, her daughter's pain symptoms actually started to improve. Nevertheless, the mother wanted her daughter to undergo the second injection to see if it would also help, but it did not help at all. At the time of her follow-up clinic appointment, the benefits of the initial injection had worn off. Based on her response to the initial injection, the diagnosis of a right SCN entrapment syndrome was confirmed.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^114Pp8ZA]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Sciatic nerve

The sciatic nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the L4 to S3 nerve roots and leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen at the inferior border of the piriformis muscle. It provides motor supply to the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus and the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus. The sciatic nerve divides into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve which provide motor and sensory supply to the anterior, lateral and posterior lower leg as well as to the sole of the foot. The proximal sciatic nerve may be compromised by trauma, tumours, haematomas and compression in the subgluteal space is termed deep gluteal syndrome. Causes of this include piriformis syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement and fibrovascular bands. The distal branches can be damaged by fractures, bandages or tumours such as ganglion cysts.

Piriformis syndrome (illustrated in Fig. 1) is a controversial diagnosis, with no consensus about diagnostic criteria. Hence, the diagnosis is typically one of exclusion. In particular, it is important to exclude lumbar spinal pathology before making the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome. The aetiology of this syndrome is nerve compression or irritation in the greater sciatic foramen by disorders related to the piriformis muscle. This can be primary, as a result of intrinsic piriformis muscle pathology such as hypertrophy. More commonly, it is secondary to other pathology at the level of the greater sciatic foramen, for example space-occupying lesions or oedema from sacroiliitis. In a minority of patients, the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle. Patients suffering from this condition present with neuropathic pain in the sciatic nerve distribution, i.e. the leg and buttock. MRI can demonstrate anatomical variation of the sciatic nerve and hypertrophy of the piriformis muscle. It can also reveal secondary causes such as mass lesions. Electromyography can aid in diagnosis. Treatment for piriformis syndrome includes physical therapy, and a combination of local anaesthetic and corticosteroid injections, which may also have a diagnostic role.

### The clinical features of the piriformis syndrome: a systematic review [^112gfukW]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome, sciatica caused by compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, has been described for over 70 years; yet, it remains controversial. The literature consists mainly of case series and narrative reviews. The objectives of the study were: first, to make the best use of existing evidence to estimate the frequencies of clinical features in patients reported to have PS; second, to identify future research questions. A systematic review was conducted of any study type that reported extractable data relevant to diagnosis. The search included all studies up to 1 March 2008 in four databases: AMED, CINAHL, Embase and Medline. Screening, data extraction and analysis were all performed independently by two reviewers. A total of 55 studies were included: 51 individual and 3 aggregated data studies, and 1 combined study. The most common features found were: buttock pain, external tenderness over the greater sciatic notch, aggravation of the pain through sitting and augmentation of the pain with manoeuvres that increase piriformis muscle tension. Future research could start with comparing the frequencies of these features in sciatica patients with and without disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

Report of a case

An African-American man in his mid-30s presented with the complaint of a "sore" on his right buttock. This slowly enlarging, nonpruritic lesion had been present for more than 1 year and had been painful upon sitting. He admitted to frequently picking at the area. He denied previous history of similar lesions and prior skin changes in the area. The patient denied significant sun exposure and any family history of dermatologic malignancy. Medical history was significant for poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and heavy tobacco smoking.

Physical examination of the right buttock found a hyperpigmented relatively well-demarcated 2-cm plaque with multiple 3- to 4-mm-thick yellow-brown hornlike projections (Fig 1). No other significant lesions were noted in the area. At this time, a specific clinical diagnosis was unclear, and the leading differential diagnoses included a large verruca and, less likely, a morphologically unusual squamous cell carcinoma. Because of the diagnostic uncertainty and the symptomatic nature of the lesion, the patient was offered biopsy.

### Facet joint syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112T9vTd]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

The clinical diagnosis of facetogenic LBP is still debated. Facetogenic LBP is also known as non-specific LBP, the clinical presentation of which is lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posteriorly to the LFJ but also anteriorly in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. So, in space-occupying spinal lesions, such as osteophytes or synovial cysts, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain. In 1911, Goldthwaite first described that LFJ is a source of LBP. In 1927, Putti proposed that the degeneration and inflammation of the LFJ may cause sciatica through nerve irritation. In 1933, Ghormhley named a symptom originating from the LFJ "facet syndrome", which was lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Facetogenic LBP may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica, and "pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates unilateral or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2-L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits. Campos et althought that patients with facetogenic LBP may have symptoms such as lumbar paraspinal palpation with increased pain; and increased pain during one or more of the following: 1) extension (more than flexion)/rotation, 2) extension/side flexion, and 3) extension/rotation. Gómez et alemphasized its characteristics as follows, 1) improvement with rest, absence of root pattern, may have pseudoradicular pattern, however, the pain is more lumbar than pain in the leg and 3 clinical signs. But this kind of pain does not resemble sciatica as it spreads through dorsal side of the leg and reaches the feet and toes. Laslett et alfound that a cluster of clinical signs ("Revel's criteria"), consisting of 7 clinical signs, may be valuable in predicting the results of an initial screening ZJ block, with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80%. Although, nowadays pain produced by the LFJ has a few diagnostic scales and even though many scientists have tried to summarize the clinical features of facetogenic LBP, they cannot make a diagnosis based on it. Due to clinical heterogeneity, Maas et aldisapproved the diagnostic accuracy of patient history and/or physical examination to identify facetogenic LBP, which depended on a diagnostic block.

### Superior cluneal nerve entrapment [^112ncuck]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pain due to superior cluneal nerve entrapment is an infrequent cause of unilateral low back pain. Here we present a case of acute unilateral low back pain treated by superior cluneal nerve (SCN) block.

Case Report

A 55-year-old woman presented to the outpatient clinic suffering from unilateral low back pain localized to right iliac crest and radiating to the right buttock. Her history was taken, physical examination was performed, and a thorough radiologic evaluation was performed to minimize radiculopathy and facet syndromes as causative. After transient pain relief with a diagnostic trigger point injection, entrapment of SCN was diagnosed and therapeutic nerve block with local anesthetic and steroid combination was performed.

Conclusion

SCN is prone to entrapment where it passes through the fascia near the posterior iliac crest. Unilateral low back pain and deep tenderness radiating to the ipsilateral buttock are the clinical findings accompanying SCN entrapment. The case presented emphasizes the relief of possible SCN after limiting other etiologic causes of low back pain.

### Treatment strategies for ischiofemoral impingement: a systematic review [^115G2D74]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

There is relatively little information available on the best management strategy for patients with IFI. This is mainly because of the uncertainty of diagnosis and the fact that conservative treatment such as physiotherapy or activity modification is undertaken as a first step in the management of most cases with IFI. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients in whom conservative treatment fails. Until recently, excision of the LT with an open approach had been recommended as a normal operative technique for IFI with a narrowed ischiofemoral distance, however, with the improvement in arthroscopic techniques and devices, some authors report on the entire LT being accessed and resected endoscopically.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence in the literature that provides hip surgeons with evidence-based recommendations on the management of IFI, and no systematic review has been published in this arena thus far. The aim of this study, therefore, was to provide the reader with the available treatment strategies and their related outcomes for IFI based on the best available evidence, whilst highlighting classically accepted ways of treatment as well as relatively new surgical and non-surgical techniques. The objective of this systematic review would be to look at patients from both genders with no demographic restriction, who had any treatment for IFI to treat and alleviate buttock and posterior hip pain with or without distal neuropathic pain radiation and by including the studies reporting on IFI treatment and this would provide the current treatment strategies in practice.

### Rupture of the corpus cavernosum in a pediatric patient [^1173zwp3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pediatric penile pain is an uncommon complaint and is associated with a wide differential diagnosis including infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, and idiopathic conditions. Penile fractures, anatomically known as rupture of the corpus cavernosum, are almost exclusively reported in sexually mature patients and usually involve forceful manipulation during sexual activity. Rupture of the corpus cavernosum is a true urologic emergency. Failure to recognize and treat rupture of the corpus cavernosum has been associated with residual penile angulation, persistent hematoma, abscess, erectile dysfunction, and fibrosis. We present the case of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy who presented to our emergency department with complaints of penile pain with movement after falling and colliding with staircase railing. Examination showed ecchymosis and swelling of the penile shaft; both testicles were palpable and nontender, with no perineal or scrotal bruising. Ultrasound noted discontinuity along the right corpus cavernosum consistent with a rupture of the right corpus cavernosum. Testicles were noted to be in the scrotum with normal Doppler flow. Flexible cystoscopy revealed an uninjured urethra and bladder. Our patient was urgently taken to the operating room for repair of his injury. Thanks to the timely surgical correction, there were no postsurgical complications, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 1. This case demonstrates that although most reports of corpus cavernosum injuries are associated with sexual intercourse, other modes are possible and should be considered for acute-onset penile pain in pediatric patients.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: a comprehensive review [^111xZWFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Piriformis Syndrome

PS occurs when the piriformis muscle compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve, causing symptoms such as buttock and leg pain, altered sensations along the nerve's path, and discomfort while sitting. This condition is more commonly discussed in hip preservation literature, with a few reports in patients post-THA.

Clinical Presentation

Patients often present with vague symptoms that considerably overlap with those of other hip, pelvic, and lumbar spine pathologies, making precise clinical assessment challenging. Multiple clinical tests have been described: the straight leg raise test has a sensitivity of 15% and a specificity of 95%, the active piriformis test shows a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 80%, and the seated piriformis stretch test has a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 90%. Furthermore, combining the active piriformis test with the seated piriformis stretch test yields a reported sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 80%.

Diagnosis Studies

A lumbar MRI examination should be considered to rule out underlying back pathology. Improved MRI resolution, the use of ultrasound-guided injections, and increased awareness may enhance the accuracy of diagnosing PS. However, in our experience, no single diagnostic tool is reliably accurate when used in isolation. The diagnosis is most accurately confirmed when guided injections are used in cases with a high degree of clinical suspicion.

Treatment

Initial management of PS involves rest, activities modifications, NSAIDs, and guided steroids injections, which typically yield positive responses in most cases.

For recalcitrant cases, surgical interventions, such as sciatic neurolysis and piriformis tenotomy, have been the mainstays of treatment, with both open and endoscopic techniques showing favorable outcomes. For instance, Uchio et al presented a case report of a patient with bilateral PS, 4 and 6 years after a cementless THA. After failing conservative treatment, the patient underwent open tenotomy and sciatic neurolysis, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms. The modern endoscopic release of the piriformis tendon and exploration of the sciatic nerve is currently the standard of treatment for these unresponsive cases(Figure 5).

### Piriformis syndrome, diagnosis and treatment [^1152xMTz]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an uncommon cause of sciatica that involves buttock pain referred to the leg. Diagnosis is often difficult, and it is one of exclusion due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests. Treatment for PS has historically focused on stretching and physical therapy modalities, with refractory patients also receiving anesthetic and corticosteroid injections into the piriformis muscle origin, belly, muscle sheath, or sciatic nerve sheath. Recently, the use of botulinum toxin (BTX) to treat PS has gained popularity. Its use is aimed at relieving sciatic nerve compression and inherent muscle pain from a tight piriformis. BTX is being used increasingly for myofascial pain syndromes, and some studies have demonstrated superior efficacy to corticosteroid injection. The success of BTX in treating PS supports the prevailing pathoanatomic etiology of the condition and suggests a promising future for BTX in the treatment of other myofascial pain syndromes.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Radiofrequency sensory ablation as a treatment for symptomatic unilateral lumbosacral junction pseudarticulation (bertolotti's syndrome): a case report [^112TEZhc]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and successful treatment of a case of symptomatic unilateral lumbosacral junction pseudarticulation using a novel radiofrequency nerve ablation technique.

Case

A 56-year-old female patient who had suffered with low back and right upper buttock pain for 16 years experienced incomplete relief with L4/5 facet joint radiofrequency ablation. She was found to have an elongated right L5 transverse process that articulated with the sacral ala (Bertolotti's syndrome). Fluoroscopically guided local anesthetic/corticosteroid injection into the pseudarthrosis eliminated her residual right buttock pain for the duration of the local anesthetic only. Complete pain relief was achieved by injecting local anesthetic circumferentially around the posterior pseudarthrosis articular margin. Accordingly, bipolar radiofrequency strip thermal lesions were created at the same locations. Complete pain relief and full restoration of function was achieved for 16 months postprocedure.

Conclusion

This case report describes a novel radiofrequency technique for treating symptomatic lumbosacral junction pseudarticulation that warrants further evaluation.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^1136hszH]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common human health problems and accounts for a significant amount of disability worldwide. It is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat given its unclear pathology, multifactorial causes, biopsychosocial aspects, and poorly defined treatment algorithms. Interestingly, the SIJ has been estimated to contribute to pain in as much as 38% of cases of LBP. Given these findings, it is felt that SIJ pain is highly underdiagnosed and also undertreated. In addition, there is no clear diagnostic or treatment pathway once identified. In this article, we reviewed the diagnostic criteria and treatment options to begin to establish a clearer pathway and algorithm for patients.

Patients generally present with pain below the belt line or isolated over the SIJ. Radiation can be most commonly into the posterior leg, groin, or buttock. There is usually an absence of thigh pain, especially in older patients. In addition to SI joint dysfunction, clinicians should be aware of broader differential diagnosis in regards to other possible sources of posterior hip and lower back pain. In addition to other common spinal pathologies such as the lower facet joints and lumbar discs, other pathologies such as tarlov cysts, pudendal nerve entrapments, hamstring tendinopathies, and piriformis syndrome should also be considered. Additionally in female patients, intrapelvic sources such as endometriosis and pelvic varicosities should be considered. The sacroiliac joint is also affected by the lack of movement in the hip joint. Hip abnormalities limiting flexion can cause increased strain on sacroiliac joint, while limitation in hip extension is also reported by some authors in association with low back pain.

SIJ Provocative Tests

FABER Test (Patrick's Test)

When performing the FABER test (Figure 1), the patient lies supine on the examination table. The examiner brings the hip joint on the ipsilateral side of SIJ pain into the FABER position. The ipsilateral knee is flexed at 90° and the hip is externally rotated with the ipsilateral foot resting on the contralateral knee. Subsequently, the examiner presses the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) against the table and pushes the flexed knee down toward the table. The test is considered positive if the patient feels pain in the SIJ on the side where the knee was flexed. Although, some textbooks suggest the FABER test can also stress the contralateral SIJ. At this point, pain in the buttocks is suggestive of SIJ pain, whereas pain in the groin region could indicate hip pathology. When performed correctly, the FABER test can have one of the highest sensitivities of the five provocative maneuvers. This test is also useful in this current age of telemedicine as patients can perform their own FABER examination by sitting on a chair, and crossing the ankle of the affected side over the contralateral knee and pushing down on their ipsilateral knee while leaning back in their chair.

Figure 1
FABER Test (Patrick's Test) – With the patient in a supine position, the lower extremity ipsilateral to the patient's painful SIJ is correctly positioned by lying their lateral ankle on the contralateral anterior thigh. Then with the clinician standing on the side of the painful SIJ, one hand must stabilize the contralateral ASIS with firm pressure, while simultaneously applying a downward force through the ipsilateral flexed, externally rotated and abducted lower extremity, as depicted by the arrow.

Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test)

When performing the Thigh Thrust Test (Figure 2), the patient lies in a supine position while the tested-side hip joint and knee are flexed to approximately 90° by the examiner. An anterior to posterior shear force is applied to the SIJ through the axis of the femur. Resulting pain at the ipsilateral SIJ indicates a positive test.

Figure 2
Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test) – With the patient lying in a supine position the hip and knee ipsilateral to the painful SIJ are flexed, and the femur is positioned perpendicular to the table. A linear downward force through the femur towards the table is applied as depicted by the arrow.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain. Level of evidence II.

2.5. Questions about pain characteristics

For each of the marked first-tier regions, the respondent was asked to rate pain onset, episode frequency, episode duration (including constant pain without pause), pain intensity, bothering, and depth of pain (superficial, deep, or both). If the respondent had experienced more than one type of pain within a first-tier region, he or she was asked to rate the pain that had bothered him or her the most.

Onset of pain was assessed with the response options less than 4 weeks, 1 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 11 months, 1 to 2, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years. Participants reporting more than 5 years in pain were asked to report about their age at pain onset. Episode frequency was reported on a 29-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0–28 days) (Question: During the last 4 weeks: How many days have you had the pain?). Episode duration within the last 4 weeks (Question: About how much of the day have you usually had the pain? [Only count the time when you are awake]) was assessed with the response options less than 1, 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 10 hours, more than 10 hours, or all the time, without pause. Pain intensity the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No pain" (0) and "The strongest imaginable pain" (10) by answering the question "How strong has the pain usually been?" Similarly, bothering the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No bother" (0) and "The greatest imaginable bother" (10), in response to the question "How much has the pain usually bothered you?" Depth of pain was assessed by the question "Where is the pain located?" using the response options "Superficially", "Deeply", "Both of the above", or "I don't know". Participants who reported pain in the lower back were also asked about radiating leg pain (yes/no), the distance of the radiation (hip/buttocks; thigh/knee; lower leg/ankle; heel/sole of the foot; instep/toes), and those with pain radiating to the heel, foot sole, or toes where asked about altered sensation in the painful foot (eg, numbness and tingling) (yes/no).

Movement evoked pain

Prior to performing each movement task, the participant was asked to rate their hip joint pain using a numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain imaginable). The patient then performed 20 repetitions of a step-down tap while keeping the limb of their study hip on the step and tapping the floor with the contralateral limb. The step height used was based on each patient's height: 15.2 cm for heights < 163 cm, 20.3 cm for heights 163–180 cm, and 25.4 cm for heights > 180 cm. After completion of 20 repetitions, the patient rated their hip joint pain again. This procedure was then repeated using a bilateral, deep squat. For this task, the patients stood just in front of the step used for the step-down tap task. They were instructed to squat and tap their buttocks on the step. If they were unable to reach the step, they were encouraged to squat 'as low as you can go'.For both tasks, each patient was allowed to self-select the position of their feet.

### Piriformis syndrome versus radiculopathy following lumbar artificial disc replacement [^1165htFE]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Objective

To describe the presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment of five patients with piriformis syndrome after lumbar artificial disc replacement.

Summary Of Background Data

Until recently, spinal fusion was considered the standard for surgical treatment of severe lumbar degenerative disc disease. However, artificial disc replacement now offers an alternative solution. Piriformis syndrome results from entrapment of the sciatic nerve at the greater sciatic notch, with symptoms of pain and numbness radiating from the buttock to the foot, mimicking radiculopathy.

Methods

In this case series, we report five patients who developed piriformis at our institution after artificial disc replacement.

Results

Five patients, aged 35 to 46 years, developed some or all of the following symptoms in the affected leg after artificial disc replacement: posterior leg and buttock pain, calf weakness, and toe and ball of foot numbness and tingling. The onset of symptoms ranged from 6 days to 8 months postoperative, and became debilitating over time. Each patient was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome through physical examination. Three of the patients received a piriformis injection and reported 50% to 100% pain relief lasting 1 to 3 weeks. The patients subsequently underwent physical therapy that provided relief of their piriformis syndrome-related pain and enabled them to resume their normal activities.

Conclusion

Piriformis syndrome has not previously been described in the literature as a sequela of lumbar artificial disc replacement. Our case series indicates that this complication may be underdiagnosed. Careful consideration after artificial disc replacement is required if the patient presents with buttock, leg or foot pain, and/or numbness. It is important for physicians to recognize the symptoms of piriformis syndrome and to differentiate piriformis syndrome from nerve root compression and irritation or referred pain from spinal structures. Although controversial, the proper diagnosis of piriformis syndrome may have prevented some of these patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical procedures.

### Delayed herniation of intra-abdominal contents after blunt right-sided diaphragm rupture [^111kKCmV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Right diaphragmatic hernia is a rare injury (0.25%-1%) after blunt abdominal trauma. The diagnosis may be delayed and achieved years after the trauma. We currently report a case of a 48-year-old man who presented to the emergency department at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan, demonstrating signs of herniation of the right diaphragm. The herniation was confirmed using a chest radiograph. The patient reported falling 3 years before the current evaluation and was symptom-free before arrival in the emergency department. The diagnosis was further confirmed through thoracoabdominal computed tomography. The diaphragmatic hernia was subsequently repaired via abdominal approach. For patients with a history of prior thoracoabdominal trauma with complaints of new abdominal pain, a delayed diaphragmatic hernia should be considered.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy was admitted because of the sudden appearance and increase in size in few days of a large swelling of the right buttock without functional limitations of the hip. The child was in good health and denied any recent trauma. Physical examination showed a right buttock lesion with a tight, but not painful, flexible consistency; superficial venous prominence or discoloration of the skin was absent. The range of motion of the hip was complete for both active and passive movements and free from pain. The patient had no lameness nor any painful symptoms in performing daily activities. Biochemical investigations including complete blood count, liver and kidney function, inflammatory markers, and electrolytes were normal. No bone involvement at right hip radiograph. Ultrasonography showed, in comparison with another done before admittance, a complex mass with solid and cystic components increased in size of about 5 cm in 3 days. At lower-limb contrast MRI, evidence of an oval lesion, measuring 10 × 15 × 8 cm, located between the gluteus medius and the gluteus maximus. The lesion was well-capsulated, with branches and septa inside, weak endostructural diffusion, and wall irregularities with no infiltrative phenomena into surrounding tissues (Figure 1). Total-body scintigraphy showed no metabolic activity at the level of the lesion.

### "Toilet seat" sciatic neuropathy… [^113LyedR]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

A 41-YEAR-OLD alcoholic man fell asleep sitting on a toilet seat after drinking heavily and taking oral benzodiazepines. When he awoke a few hours later, he felt his buttocks stuck inside the opening of the seat. He was able to pull himself out, but as he tried to stand up, his left leg gave way, he fell onto the bathroom floor, and he was unable to get up for the remainder of the night. His roommate found him in the morning and called for an ambulance. He complained of low back pain, left buttock pain, and left leg numbness and weakness. The left hamstring, anterior tibial, and gastrocnemius muscles were markedly weak. The left glutei, iliopsoas, hip adductors, and quadriceps muscles were normal. He was numb to pinprick over the entire left foot and lateral calf. Sensation was normal over the left thigh and saddle area. The left ankle reflex was absent, but the knee jerk and plantar responses were normal. There were no petechiae or ecchymoses over the buttocks.

His serum creatine kinase level was elevated at 42, 000 U/L, and he had myoglobinuria. Computed tomographic imaging of his pelvis was suggestive of gluteal compartment syndrome. He refused electrodiagnostic studies. He was managed conservatively, subsequently failed to follow up after discharge, but was finally readmitted 4 months later because of head trauma sustained as a result of alcohol intoxication. There had been little recovery of neurologic function to the left leg at that time. Sciatic neuropathy is a recognized complication of gluteal compartment syndrome, 1 and similar cases have been reported as "Saturday night palsy" from toilet seat entrapment.
