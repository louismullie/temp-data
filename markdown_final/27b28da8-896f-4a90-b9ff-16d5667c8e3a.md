## Question

Can Vimpat be used in patients with a history of cardiac disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Vimpat (lacosamide) can be used in patients with a history of cardiac disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific cardiac conditions that increase risk with lacosamide. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism that drives those risks. Next, I will review the FDA labeling and quantify the magnitude of risk signals from trials and postmarketing. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions that amplify risk. Then, I will outline a practical, stepwise approach to screening, monitoring, and dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and highlight special populations and alternatives, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the cardiac risk profile. The FDA labeling repeatedly warns about proarrhythmic risk in patients with conduction disease (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus without a pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (myocardial ischemia, heart failure, structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome, and it also flags atrial fibrillation/flutter and syncope, especially in those with cardiovascular disease or diabetic neuropathy [^112FL1yP] [^112nvk34] [^111XrFHX] [^113zcitR].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Lacosamide enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which can slow atrioventricular nodal conduction and produce dose-related PR prolongation; in healthy volunteers, mean PR increased by about 7–12 ms at 400–800 mg/day, and in trials, asymptomatic first-degree AV block occurred in roughly 0.4% of patients, with postmarketing reports of bradycardia, AV block, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and rare asystole or cardiac arrest, typically in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions or interacting drugs [^1115key4] [^1178A9bF] [^1165WSPm] [^115oMYxT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should quantify the risk signals. In short-term controlled epilepsy trials without significant systemic illness, syncope was not increased versus placebo, but in diabetic neuropathy trials (not an epilepsy indication), syncope occurred in about 1.2% on lacosamide versus 0% on placebo, and atrial fibrillation/flutter was seen in about 0.5% on lacosamide versus 0% on placebo; importantly, most syncope cases clustered at doses above 400 mg/day and were linked to orthostatic changes, atrial arrhythmias, or bradycardia, and postmarketing has documented rare but serious events including cardiac arrest, often with concomitant conduction-slowing drugs or structural heart disease [^111XrFHX] [^112FL1yP] [^1165WSPm].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions that heighten risk. Concomitant agents that slow AV nodal conduction or prolong the PR interval — such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and other sodium channel blockers including certain AEDs — can potentiate lacosamide's PR prolongation and precipitate AV block or ventricular tachyarrhythmias; the label recommends obtaining a baseline ECG and repeating after titration to steady state in such patients, with heightened vigilance if IV lacosamide is used [^1159JUeK] [^113ork7r] [^112FL1yP].

> Let me think about a practical, risk-mitigation approach. I should confirm baseline cardiac history, symptoms (palpitations, syncope, presyncope), and medications, then obtain a 12-lead ECG before initiation in anyone with cardiac disease or on interacting drugs; if I find significant conduction disease or high-risk features, I should consider cardiology input before starting. I will titrate slowly, avoid exceeding 400 mg/day because doses above that do not improve efficacy and increase adverse effects, and repeat an ECG after reaching steady state; if a loading dose is needed, I should administer it with medical supervision given the possibility of cardiovascular adverse reactions, and I will monitor vitals and rhythm during IV infusions, especially if pushed rapidly [^112FL1yP] [^112nvk34] [^112XGV2j] [^1114mi2V].

> But wait, what if the patient already has a pacemaker or only mild, stable disease? I should double-check that the presence of a pacemaker mitigates bradyarrhythmic risk, though tachyarrhythmias and proarrhythmic substrate remain relevant; in carefully selected patients with mild conduction disease or compensated structural heart disease, lacosamide may still be reasonable with close monitoring, whereas in high-grade AV block without pacing, recent myocardial ischemia, decompensated heart failure, or Brugada syndrome, I should generally avoid lacosamide or proceed only with cardiology co-management and contingency plans for rhythm management [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations. In neonates and young infants, case reports and series describe bradycardia, AV block, and even cardiac arrest temporally associated with lacosamide, so if used off-label, continuous cardiac monitoring and serial ECGs are prudent. In older adults, the background prevalence of conduction abnormalities is higher, so a lower threshold for baseline and follow-up ECGs is sensible. In status epilepticus, IV lacosamide is increasingly used, but I should remember the risk of hypotension and conduction effects and weigh it against alternatives like levetiracetam that lack sodium channel blockade, especially in patients with unstable cardiac disease [^116acGTE] [^115UGnFu] [^111V613w] [^116vJSYk] [^115pLUi7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought lacosamide meaningfully widens QRS and could mimic Class IA toxicity. Let me verify that. Thorough QT/QRS studies in healthy subjects show no clinically important QRS widening at therapeutic doses and no QTc prolongation, with the consistent signal being PR prolongation; case reports of QRS widening typically reflect overdose or polypharmacy with other sodium channel blockers, so at therapeutic doses the main conduction concern is PR prolongation and AV nodal effects rather than ventricular depolarization delay per se [^1115key4] [^1178A9bF] [^1168m9b4] [^1169R3Mv].

> Next, I should review alternatives and comparative safety. Levetiracetam lacks sodium channel blockade and is often preferred in patients with significant cardiac disease or conduction abnormalities; brivaracetam shares favorable interaction and tolerability profiles; phenytoin and carbamazepine, while effective, also have sodium channel effects and can worsen conduction or lower blood pressure in the ICU setting, so in patients with unstable cardiac disease, avoiding additional sodium channel blockade may be prudent when effective non–sodium channel options exist [^115pLUi7] [^115BqeKh] [^111TCsT4].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. Vimpat (lacosamide) is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with cardiac disease, but it requires caution proportional to risk: use is generally acceptable with baseline ECG screening, slow titration, avoidance of supratherapeutic doses, rhythm monitoring during IV administration, and repeat ECG after titration, with cardiology input for high-risk substrates; avoid or choose alternatives in patients with high-grade AV block without pacing, recent myocardial ischemia, decompensated heart failure, Brugada syndrome, or when multiple conduction-slowing drugs are necessary, and counsel patients to report palpitations, syncope, or dizziness promptly [^112FL1yP] [^112nvk34] [^111XrFHX] [^1159JUeK].

---

Vimpat (lacosamide) can be used in patients with cardiac disease, but **caution is required** due to risks of PR prolongation, AV block, and ventricular arrhythmias [^1178A9bF]. Baseline and post-titration ECGs are **recommended** [^112nvk34], and patients with severe cardiac disease, conduction disorders, or on conduction-slowing drugs should be closely monitored [^112FL1yP]. Avoid use in **severe cardiac disease** or **significant conduction abnormalities** unless benefits outweigh risks and a cardiologist is consulted.

## Cardiac effects of lacosamide

Lacosamide causes **dose-dependent PR prolongation** and can precipitate AV block, bradycardia, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias; rare cases of asystole, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or conduction abnormalities [^1178A9bF] [^1165WSPm].

---

## Clinical evidence of cardiac adverse effects

- **PR prolongation**: Dose-dependent PR prolongation has been observed in clinical studies [^1115key4].
- **AV block**: Asymptomatic first-degree AV block occurred in 0.4% of patients in adjunctive clinical trials [^1178A9bF].
- **Bradycardia**: Profound bradycardia has been reported, particularly with intravenous administration [^1178A9bF].
- **Ventricular arrhythmias**: Postmarketing reports include ventricular tachyarrhythmias, asystole, and cardiac arrest, often in patients with underlying cardiac disease or concomitant medications affecting cardiac conduction [^1178A9bF] [^1165WSPm].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations are at **increased risk** of cardiac adverse effects with lacosamide:

| **Patient population** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Severe cardiac disease | - Myocardial ischemia <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Structural heart disease [^112FL1yP] |
| Conduction disorders | - Marked first-degree AV block <br/> - Second-degree or higher AV block <br/> - Sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker <br/> - Cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada syndrome) [^112FL1yP] |
| Concomitant medications | - Sodium channel blockers <br/> - Beta-blockers <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Potassium channel blockers <br/> - Medications prolonging PR interval [^1159JUeK] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ECG monitoring**: Obtain an ECG before starting lacosamide and after titration to steady-state maintenance dose in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions or on concomitant medications affecting cardiac conduction [^112FL1yP] [^112nvk34].
- **Intravenous administration**: Administer loading doses with medical supervision due to the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including cardiovascular adverse reactions [^1178A9bF] [^1165WSPm].
- **Patient counseling**: Inform patients about cardiac signs and symptoms (e.g. palpitations, dizziness, syncope) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^114ehuih].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or avoidance

- **Severe cardiac disease**: Use caution or avoid in patients with severe cardiac disease, such as myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or structural heart disease [^112FL1yP].
- **Significant conduction abnormalities**: Use caution or avoid in patients with significant conduction abnormalities, including marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block, sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker, or cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada syndrome) [^112FL1yP].
- **Concomitant medications**: Use caution in patients taking medications that affect cardiac conduction, such as sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, or medications that prolong the PR interval [^1159JUeK].

---

## Alternative antiepileptic medications

Alternative antiepileptic medications may be considered for patients with significant cardiac disease or conduction abnormalities, including **levetiracetam**, which has minimal cardiac effects and does not significantly affect cardiac conduction, and **gabapentin**, which also has minimal cardiac effects and is generally considered safe in patients with cardiac disease.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Lacosamide (Vimpat) can be used in patients with cardiac disease, but **caution is required** due to the risk of PR prolongation, AV block, and ventricular arrhythmias. Baseline and post-titration ECGs are recommended, and patients with severe cardiac disease, conduction disorders, or on conduction-slowing drugs should be closely monitored. Use alternative antiepileptic medications in patients with significant cardiac disease or conduction abnormalities.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive lacosamide in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116aDPbu]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of lacosamide (up to 12mg/kg/day or 400mg/day) as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in patients (≥ 4 years) with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE).

Methods

Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (SP0982; NCT02408523) in patients with IGE and PGTCS taking 1–3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Primary outcome was time to second PGTCS during 24-week treatment.

Results

242 patients were randomised and received ≥ 1dose of trial medication (lacosamide/placebo: n = 121/n = 121). Patients (mean age: 27.7 years; 58.7% female) had a history of generalised-onset seizures (tonic-clonic 99.6%; myoclonic 38.8%; absence 37.2%). Median treatment duration with lacosamide/placebo was 143/65 days. Risk of developing a second PGTCS during 24-week treatment was significantly lower with lacosamide than placebo (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates 55.27%/33.37%; HR 0.540, 95% CI 0.377 to 0.774; p < 0.001; n = 118/n = 121). Median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated for lacosamide (> 50% of patients did not experience a second PGTCS) and was 77.0 days for placebo. Kaplan-Meier estimated freedom from PGTCS at end of the 24-week treatment period (day 166) for lacosamide/placebo was 31.3%/17.2% (difference 14.1%; p = 0.011). More patients on lacosamide than placebo had ≥ 50% (68.1%/46.3%) or ≥ 75% (57.1%/36.4%) reduction from baseline in PGTCS frequency/28 days, or observed freedom from PGTCS during treatment (27.5%/13.2%) (n = 119/n = 121). 96/121 (79.3%) patients on lacosamide had treatment-emergent adverse events (placebo 79/121 (65.3%)), most commonly dizziness (23.1%), somnolence (16.5%), headache (14.0%). No patients died during the trial.

Conclusions

Lacosamide was efficacious and generally safe as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled PGTCS in patients with IGE.

What Was Added to the United States Label?

The following 2 paragraphs were added:

Warnings and precautions (5.4) Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities: In vitro testing showed that Lamictal exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Based on this activity, Lamictal (lamotrigine) could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, including sudden death, in people with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, avoid the use of Lamictal in people who have cardiac conduction disorders (eg, second- or third-degree heart block), ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac disease or abnormality (eg, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome, or other sodium channelopathies). Concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may increase the risk of proarrhythmia.

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2). Effect of Lamictal: In vitro studies show that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It inhibits human cardiac sodium channels with rapid onset and offset kinetics and strong voltage dependence, consistent with other Class IB antiarrhythmic agents. Lamictal did not slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) in healthy individuals in a thorough QT study; however, it could slow ventricular conduction and increase the risk of arrhythmia in people with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Elevated heart rates could also increase the risk of ventricular conduction slowing with Lamictal.

2.2 Alternate Initial Dosage Information to Achieve the Maintenance Dosage in a Shorter Timeframe

For monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 17 years of age and older and for adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 17 years of age and older, an alternate initial dosing regimen for week 1 (e.g., including a loading dose and/or a higher initial dosage) may be administered in patients for whom achieving the recommended maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe is clinically indicated (see Table 2). The alternate initial dosage regimen should be continued for one week. Lacosamide tablets may then be titrated based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week, if needed. The loading dose should be administered with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 2.

2.3 Converting From a Single Antiepileptic (AED) to Lacosamide Monotherapy for the Treatment of Partial-Onset Seizures

For patients who are already on a single AED and will convert to lacosamide monotherapy, withdrawal of the concomitant AED should not occur until the therapeutic dosage of lacosamide is achieved and has been administered for at least 3 days. A gradual withdrawal of the concomitant AED over at least 6 weeks is recommended.

### Lacosamide overdose: a case of QRS prolongation and seizure [^1169R3Mv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lacosamide is a third-generation antiepileptic drug. Its likely mechanism of action is via neuronal sodium channel blockade, via a unique manner compared with other antiepileptic drugs that block sodium channels. A paucity of information exists regarding lacosamide overdosage. Lacosamide overdosage is thought to cause QRS prolongation and seizures, due to its effect of sodium channel blockade. The potential efficacy of sodium bicarbonate to reverse the effects of lacosamide has not been well studied. Furthermore, prior reports of lacosamide toxicity have occurred in the setting of concomitant polypharmacy. Thus, the isolated toxic effects of the drug have not been well elucidated.

Case Report

We report a case of a suspected, single-ingestion overdose on lacosamide. The patient developed signs of cardiotoxicity and seizure. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? After lacosamide overdosage, the emergency physician must be capable of acute management of subsequent lacosamide toxicity. Understanding the mechanisms of action causing toxicity due to this drug can help the clinician to anticipate the interventions that may be needed or useful to treat this potentially toxic ingestion.

Abnormal ST‐T Changes After Seizure Episodes

We also observed ST‐segment elevation and abnormal T waves in 5 patients after seizure episodes. Since these patients showed an incomplete RBBB pattern, these patients were not included in the evaluation of QT intervals. Figure 3A shows ST‐segment elevation in leads V 1–2 in a 53‐year‐old man without structural brain abnormality. Preexcitation cannot be ruled out. Figure 3B shows coved‐type (V 1) and saddleback‐type (V 2) ST‐segment elevation with incomplete RBBB in a 53‐year‐old man without apparent structural abnormality. Figure 3C shows nonspecific ST‐segment elevation in leads V 2–4 and first‐degree atrioventricular block in an 87‐year‐old man with prior ischemic stroke. Figure 3D shows saddleback‐type ST‐segment elevation with incomplete RBBB in leads V 2–3 in a 78‐year‐old man with prior ischemic stroke. Figure 3E shows nonspecific ST‐segment elevation in lead V 2 observed in a 61‐year‐old man with epilepsy who was treated with levetiracetam and lacosamide. He was recommended admission for observation, but he refused. He was found dead 2 days later at his house. None of these patients showed arrhythmia in the ambulance or emergency department.

### Lacosamide boluses decreased seizure burden and were well tolerated in neonates with acute seizures: a single-center retrospective case series [^113bjPT4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Neonatal seizures are associated with worsened neurodevelopmental outcomes. Phenobarbital, the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for neonatal seizures, can cause neuronal apoptosis and may worsen neurodevelopmental outcomes. Lacosamide may be an efficacious treatment for neonatal seizures. Methods: We assessed the impact of lacosamide boluses on seizure burden in a retrospective cohort of 15 neonates monitored with video electroencephalography (EEG). Medication bolus times and seizure start/end times on EEG tracings determined change in seizure burden. Results: Seven patients received lacosamide as first- or second-line treatment and 8 as third-line or later. Average 4-hour seizure burden decreased from 13% to 3% following lacosamide boluses (P = 0.002). Reduction in seizure burden greater than 30% followed 79% of boluses. Lacosamide was well tolerated; one patient experienced mild asymptomatic episodic bradycardia that medication taper resolved. Conclusions: Lacosamide significantly decreased seizure burden in this cohort. Prospective studies of lacosamide treatment for neonatal seizures are warranted.

### Fabry disease practice resource: focused revision [^111yF1cU]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). High credibility.

Natural history and outcomes — spectrum, risk stratification cues, and therapeutic lessons in Fabry disease (FD) include that disease severity ranges from severe classic childhood-onset to more variable nonclassical FD, and family history, individual phenotype, alpha-galactosidase levels in males, lyso-GL3/lyso-Gb3, and genotype data can help position a patient on this spectrum. Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is altering the natural history, and two key lessons are that initiation of ERT in childhood significantly improves disease impact and that sudden onset malignant arrhythmias and rapid cardiac disease progression is now the primary cause of death in adults with FD. Better outcomes occur when patients should have personalized care, receive a comprehensive evaluation prior to starting ERT, start ERT earlier in life, continue thorough routine monitoring for untreated and treated organ involvement, use of adjuvant therapies is recommended to reduce disease conditions, and utilize a multidisciplinary care team.

### Lacosamide oral solution [^1138sPAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thinking and Behavior

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including lacosamide oral solution, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Dizziness and Ataxia

Patients should be counseled that lacosamide oral solution use may cause dizziness, double vision, abnormal coordination and balance, and somnolence. Patients taking lacosamide oral solution should be advised not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with lacosamide oral solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities

Patients should be counseled that lacosamide oral solution is associated with electrocardiographic changes that may predispose to irregular heart beat and syncope. Cardiac arrest has been reported. This risk is increased in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, with heart conduction problems, or who are taking other medications that affect the heart. Patients should be made aware of and report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider right away. Patients who develop syncope should lay down with raised legs and contact their health care provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Pick your poison but Pick It wisely: choosing a second-line medication for the management of status epilepticus [^117U5nmu]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

While ESETT provides high-level evidence regarding the choice of ASM in the management of SE in all age groups, other considerations may come into place when making this decision. If all 3 alternatives are equally safe and effective, we need to rather think about the long-term effects of committing a patient to these therapies. Keeping in mind that ASM are often easy to start and difficult to discontinue, considerations such as sex, medical comorbidities, pharmacologic interactions with other chronic therapies, and neuropsychiatric profile may sway the decision one way or another. Practical examples include avoiding valproic acid when treating a woman of childbearing age or fosphenytoin in patients with cardiovascular disease on chronic anticoagulation, among others.

The cause of SE may be another variable to consider. In patients with chronic epilepsy who present with medication noncompliance as the precipitating factor for SE, using the same medication the patient missed at a loading dose may result in a more sustainable therapy than adding a new medication to a patient who already had compliance issues. Checking ASM levels is useful to understand the cause of SE, even if these results will not be readily available for the acute treating team. Although SE is an emergency and clinical decisions are made within a narrow window of time, the decisions we make may become difficult to undo in the longer term. The good news is: all 3 of these medications seem to be equally effective. We have then the responsibility of choosing wisely for each patient. The information needed, such as demographics, prior history of epilepsy, home ASM doses, and potential noncompliance as well as medical and psychiatric comorbidities, is often readily available.

Since ESETT enrollment and publication, other medications have become available that are suitable for ER use in this critical situation, including lacosamide and brivaracetam as well as others coming into the market. Having a strong level of evidence of efficacy and safety for the therapies that we use is an advantage. Other medications will have to measure themselves to this standard.

One last thought is for the 40% or so of patients with established convulsive SE who do not respond to the second-line ASM. One option is to add a different second-line (now third) agent. Alternatively, considering the potential long-term damage and high mortality associated with refractory SE, moving faster to general anesthesiaunder continuous EEG monitoring may be the clear next step. Further studies are needed to evaluate this intervention.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive lacosamide in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^114jaSm5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient disposition and demographics

Between April 2015 and May 2019, 350 patients were screened at 115 sites. Overall, 242 patients were randomised; 85.1% (103/121) of patients in the lacosamide group and 90.9% (110/121) in the placebo group met a protocol-defined endpoint (figure 2). A total of 14.9% (18/121) and 9.1% (11/121) of patients discontinued the trial, respectively. The majority of discontinuations occurred during the titration period. Adverse events were the most common reason for trial discontinuation (lacosamide: 8.3%; placebo: 3.3%).

Figure 2
Patient disposition. *Two of these patients were successfully rescreened and randomised into the trial; †37 patients were baseline failures because of their PGTCS frequency during the combined baseline; ‡41/44 patients on placebo and 22/25 patients on lacosamide did not continue into maintenance because they had a second PGTCS during titration, one patient on lacosamide was labelled as a completer due to a site error, and the five remaining patients did not continue into maintenance because the 125th event had occurred in the trial; §Patients who met a protocol-defined endpoint (completion of ≥ 6 weeks of the treatment period and occurrence of two or more PGTCS, completion of 24 weeks of the treatment period without occurrence of two PGTCS, or the 125th event occurred in the trial). FAS, full analysis set; PGTCS, primary generalised tonic-clonic seizure; SS, safety set.

All 242 randomised patients received at least one dose of lacosamide or placebo and were included in the SS. Of these, 240 patients (lacosamide: 119; placebo: 121) had at least one seizure diary assessment during the treatment period and were included in the FAS.

Baseline demographics and epilepsy characteristics were similar between the lacosamide and placebo group (table 1). Most patients had a history of tonic-clonic seizures; one patient in the lacosamide group was rediagnosed with focal seizures during the trial.

Overall, 28.1% of patients in the lacosamide group and 34.7% in the placebo group were reported to have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and 10.7% and 12.4% were reported to have juvenile absence epilepsy, respectively (online supplementary table S1).

PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia

Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies of lacosamide, the active moiety in MOTPOLY XR, in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg lacosamide. When MOTPOLY XR is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.

In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with lacosamide, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [see Overdosage (10)].

MOTPOLY XR should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). MOTPOLY XR should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [s ee Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning MOTPOLY XR, and after MOTPOLY XR is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Dizziness and Ataxia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Lacosamide Tablet in Adults

In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1327 adult patients received lacosamide tablets in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months. The monotherapy development program for partial-onset seizures included 425 adult patients, 310 of whom were treated for longer than 6 months, and 254 for longer than 12 months.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Monotherapy Historical-Control Trial (Study 1)

In the monotherapy trial for partial-onset seizures, 16% of patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 300 and 400 mg/day discontinued from the trial as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reaction most commonly (≥ 1% on lacosamide) leading to discontinuation was dizziness.

Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of ≥ 2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Because this study did not include a placebo control group, causality could not be established.

5.4 Syncope

In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo- treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.

5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)

As with all AEDs, Lacosamide oral solution should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including Lacosamide oral solution. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lacosamide oral solution should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive lacosamide in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111q5U4W]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic generalised epilepsies (IGEs) account for 20%–55% of all epilepsies, and are characterised by different generalised seizure types (absence, myoclonic and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS)).PGTCS are associated with an increased risk of injuryand sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Treatment of PGTCS in patients with IGE is complex because associated seizure types, such as absence or myoclonic seizures, may be aggravated by certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Lacosamide is approved as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for patients (≥ 4 years of age) with focal (partial-onset) seizures in the European Union, USA and other countries.

A phase 2, open-label pilot study (SP0961; NCT01118949) and extension study (SP0962; NCT01118962) demonstrated the safety of lacosamide as adjunctive treatment of uncontrolled PGTCS in patients (16–65 years of age) with IGE. The purpose of this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (SP0982; NCT02408523) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive lacosamide as treatment for PGTCS in patients (≥ 4 years of age) with IGE.

Seizure types associated with IGE can be infrequent and difficult to quantify, leading to long trials with slow enrolment, thereby making it difficult to study the efficacy of AEDs by assessing reductions in seizure frequency from baseline. A post hoc analysis of a double-blind trial in patients with PGTCS showed superiority of lamotrigine over placebo when analysing time to third seizure. The authors concluded that time to 'nth' seizure could be a viable design for trials of low-frequency events. Clinical experience with adjunctive lacosamide indicated that an effective dose would be achieved more rapidly than with lamotrigine. Therefore, time to second PGTCS was chosen as the primary efficacy outcome in this trial. Using this outcome, the frequency of baseline seizures and duration of the prospective baseline can be reduced allowing for enrolment of patients more representative of the broader PGTCS population. Analysing time to second seizure further reduces the trial duration by reducing the treatment period for non-responders, ultimately reducing exposure to ineffective treatment. To our knowledge, this was the first trial assessing efficacy of an AED using this outcome.

Introduction

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)/American Epilepsy Society (AES) Task Force on the cardiac effects of lamotrigine was convened in response to a recent addition to the lamotrigine label by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lamotrigine is the nonproprietary name for a medicine that is sold under its generic name and several brand names including Lamictal™. The present advisory is based on an assessment of currently available evidence. It is not intended to replace regulatory requirements nor is it intended to be an exhaustive review. Its purpose is to advise health care professionals worldwide on how to minimize cardiac safety risks associated with lamotrigine use.

Antiseizure medications — LEV dosing considerations and comparative tolerability: Lower doses (e.g., 500 mg once or twice daily) are typically reserved for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min, and when possible, many panel members trend LEV levels and adjust LEV dosing to maintain target serum levels. An indirect comparison analysis of 24 RCTs including 8,540 patients found no differences in efficacy when comparing eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, perampanel, or brivaracetam to LEV; however, lacosamide and perampanel appeared to have higher rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and higher withdrawal rates due to adverse events, whereas brivaracetam had similar tolerability compared to LEV, and there are some data to support fewer psychiatric side effects with both lacosamide and brivaracetam compared to LEV and older generation ASMs.

Suicidal Thinking and Behavior

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including lacosamide, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Dizziness and Ataxia

Patients should be counseled that lacosamide use may cause dizziness, double vision, abnormal coordination and balance, and somnolence. Patients taking lacosamide should be advised not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with lacosamide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities

Patients should be counseled that lacosamide is associated with electrocardiographic changes that may predispose to irregular heart beat and syncope. Cardiac arrest has been reported. This risk is increased in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, with heart conduction problems, or who are taking other medications that affect the heart. Patients should be made aware of and report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider right away. Patients who develop syncope should lay down with raised legs and contact their health care provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Tolerability and safety of lacosamide in neonatal population [^115UGnFu]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lacosamide is a newer antiepileptic medication used in refractory neonatal seizures with limited safety and efficacy data. This case series spans 4 years and includes 38 neonates cared for in the neonatal, pediatric, and cardiovascular intensive care units, who received lacosamide for refractory seizures. Because lacosamide affects atrioventricular node function in adults, among other metrics, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were monitored closely in these neonates. Within this cohort, 2 neonates were found to have atrial bigeminy on ECG and telemetry. Otherwise, lacosamide was generally well tolerated with sleepiness being the most common symptom noted. This case series reports data on the tolerability of lacosamide and emphasizes the importance of monitoring key cardiac intervals with ECG before and after the use of lacosamide in this population.

### Almotriptan malate (Axert) [^113Zb6X8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with Risk Factors for CAD

It is strongly recommended that AXERT®not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history, electrocardiographic or other investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, AXERT®should not be administered [see Contraindications (4.1)].

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of AXERT®take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received AXERT®. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an ECG during the interval immediately following AXERT®, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of AXERT®and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use AXERT®.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to AXERT®. The ability of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect all cardiovascular diseases or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest at best. Cardiovascular events associated with triptan treatment have occurred in patients with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease.

Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Cardiac sodium channel blockade after an intentional ingestion of lacosamide, cyclobenzaprine, and levetiracetam: case report [^1168m9b4]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lacosamide treats partial seizures by enhancing slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. The described cardiac toxicity of lacosamide in the literature to date includes atrioventricular blockade (PR prolongation), atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, sinus pauses, ventricular tachycardia and a single cardiac arrest. We report a second case of cardiac arrest following an intentional lacosamide overdose.

Case Details

A 16 year-old female with a seizure disorder was found unresponsive in pulseless ventricular tachycardia after intentionally ingesting 4.5 g (76 mg/kg) lacosamide, 120 mg (2 mg/kg) cyclobenzaprine and an unknown amount of levetiracetam. Exact time of ingestion was unknown. Her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 139 beats per minute, QRS duration 112 ms, and terminal R-wave in lead aVR > 3 mm. Despite treatment with 150 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, she had persistent EKG findings eight hours after presentation. Her serum lacosamide concentration nine hours after presentation was elevated at 22.8 μg/mL, while serum cyclobenzaprine concentration was 16 ng/mL (therapeutic: 10–30 ng/mL), and serum levetiracetam concentration was 22.7 μg/mL (therapeutic: 12–46 μg/mL). On hospital day three, ECG demonstrated resolution of the terminal R-wave with QRS of 78 ms. The patient recovered without physical or neurologic sequelae.

Discussion

The patient's lacosamide, cyclobenzaprine and levetiracetam overdose was associated with QRS prolongation and terminal right axis deviation — suggesting sodium channel blockade as a likely etiology for her cardiac arrest. Cyclobenzaprine has potential for sodium channel blockade and ventricular dysrhythmias although cardiac toxicity due to cyclobenzaprine alone is rare. The combination of cyclobenzaprine with lacosamide may have resulted in cardiovascular collapse. In conclusion, overdose of lacosamide combined with therapeutic concentrations of sodium channel blocking xenobiotics may cause cardiac conduction delays and cardiac arrest.

5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities

PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide oral solution have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide oral solution and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg lacosamide oral solution. When lacosamide oral solution is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.

All generalised seizures

More patients on lacosamide than placebo achieved observed seizure freedom from all generalised seizures during the titration period (39/116 (33.6%) vs 32/118 (27.1%)), first 12 weeks of the treatment period (31/111 (27.9%) vs 20/116 (17.2%)) and 24-week treatment period (23/109 (21.1%) vs 15/114 (13.2%)) (SS).

Exposure

Overall, patients were exposed to lacosamide and placebo for a total of 37.2 and 31.1 patient-years, respectively (SS). The median trial medication duration was 143.0 days (range: 1.0 to 176.0) with lacosamide and 65.0 days (7.0 to 176.0) with placebo. The majority of patients on tablets (weighing ≥ 50 kg) in both the lacosamide (54/75 (72.0%)) and placebo (51/64 (79.7%)) groups took a modal maintenance dose of 400 mg/day.

### FDA safety warning on the cardiac effects of lamotrigine: an advisory from the Ad hoc ILAE / AES task force [^115sbc84]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

If I Perform an EKG and It Is Abnormal, Does That Mean I Should Not Initiate Lamotrigine?

Nonspecific EKG abnormalities (eg, nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities) are not concerning, and should not preclude these individuals from being prescribed lamotrigine.

The highest risk cases are those with second-, third-degree heart block, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, and right bundle branch block with left anterior or posterior fascicular block. These patients require thorough cardiological investigation to determine whether lamotrigine can be administered safely. If there are concerns, consultation with a cardiologist before initiating lamotrigine may be warranted.

### Subcutaneous lacosamide for continuous focal seizures [^111fqNwn]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Management of continuous focal seizure activity provides a unique challenge in palliative medicine. In cases where the patient is conscious and would prefer to remain so, we need to balance seizure-control with the sedating side effects of anti-seizure medications. Here we present a case in which subcutaneous lacosamide was given as part of a multi-modal treatment regime for a patient with continuous focal seizure activity. Lacosamide is a relatively new anti-seizure medication, that, unlike some anticonvulsants, has few drug interactions, is relatively non-sedating, and has physicochemical properties compatible with administration by the subcutaneous route. This case report adds to the very limited existing literature on the administration of lacosamide by the subcutaneous route. We conclude that lacosamide potentially provides an attractive option to contribute to the individualised care of this group of patients, and it may also have a role in the management of neuropathic pain where the enteral route is not available.

### The use of lacosamide in refractory status epilepticus [^115Tw3rA]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Case reports suggest lacosamide may have a role in status epilepticus (SE). The purpose of this case series is to describe the use of lacosamide in refractory SE (RSE) at our institution.

Methods

Observational study of all patients admitted to the neurosciences intensive care unit with RSE who received at least one dose of lacosamide from October 2009 to September 2010.

Results

Nine patients received lacosamide after failure of at least two other agents. Lacosamide was started a median of 2 days (range: 0–14 days) after the onset of SE. The most frequently used dosing regimen was an initial intravenous dose of 200 mg followed by 200 mg every 12 h. Most patients had received 3 (range: 2–5) AEDs prior to lacosamide. Levetiracetam was used prior to lacosamide in all cases. No patients evaluated responded to lacosamide according to our predefined criteria. One patient developed angioedema after receiving two doses; another patient developed angioedema where timing in relation to the lacosamide was unclear. Care was withdrawn in three of the nine patients for reasons unrelated to lacosamide. Lacosamide was continued at discharge on all surviving patients except in one case of angioedema.

Conclusions

This is the largest case series to date describing the use of lacosamide in patients with RSE. Despite the novel mechanism of action, we observed no evidence that lacosamide is effective in RSE; however, our sample size was small. Further study is needed to determine the role of lacosamide in SE, especially early in the treatment course.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: severe case of ictal asystole in temporal lobe epilepsy [^112f7N9W]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ictal asystole is a rare condition associated primarily with temporal lobe epilepsy that can cause syncope, falls, and head trauma. It is also associated with increased rates of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman with a history of childhood epilepsy who presented with 3 years of recurrent syncope. Video-EEG revealed temporal lobe seizures with ictal asystole. EKG showed stepwise progression of bradycardia, asystole, and tachycardia. MRI showed focal cortical thickening at the right insular cortex with blurring of the gray-white matter interface, consistent with insular focal cortical dysplasia. The patient was transitioned from lacosamide to clobazam because of concern for PR interval prolongation and was referred to cardiology for pacemaker placement. Ictal asystole should be considered as a rare but serious cause of unexplained recurrent syncope, particularly in patients with a history of seizures. Management includes antiepileptic drug regimen optimization, consideration of epilepsy surgery, and referral for cardiac pacing when asystole lasts longer than 6 seconds.

### Cardiac conduction delay for sodium channel antagonist antiseizure medications: an analysis of the Canadian longitudinal study on aging [^114p9kKj]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths. The CLSA population-based nature allows results to be generalizable. We identified CCDs by type of NAB. The CLSA database includes standardized ECG for all participants in the Comprehensive cohort, increasing their quality. Constructing multiple regression models allowed us to disentangle the independent associations of active epilepsy, NAB, cardiovascular risk, and heart rate–lowering medication on CCDs. Multiple imputation provided a rigorous method to handle missing data.

Our study has limitations. First, we used a modified version of an epilepsy diagnostic algorithm at baseline. The original algorithm had excellent diagnostic accuracy, but this does not apply to the modified algorithm. Misclassification from the algorithm would likely have biased results toward the null, underestimating the strength of the association between NAB and CCD. Second, we could not determine the full range of cardiovascular comorbidities, with a history of stroke, TIA, and myocardial infarction only available from self-reported data. We included use of heart rate–lowering medications and the Framingham cardiovascular risk score in our regression models to account for baseline cardiovascular risk. Third, multiple imputations are based on the assumption of missing at random. If data were not randomly missing, the results would be biased. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that the imputed data did not differ appreciably from complete case data. Fourth, ECG parameters in the CLSA were automatically estimated by recorders. Automatically estimated ECG parameters differ across manufacturers and provide variable results relative to human rater assessment. The ECGs performed the data collection sites followed a written protocol using the same machine type and brand. Fifth, there is often debate regarding what constitutes an abnormal interval on ECG, particularly given these intervals vary by age and sex. We used commonly accepted thresholds for adults and accounted for sex differences in QTc intervals. We used our borderline cutoffs for prolonged QRS and QTc abnormalities to ensure that CCDs associated with cardiac dysfunction and mortality were accounted for. The sample sizes of people with active epilepsy who used certain NABs were small (e.g. lacosamide), leading to some imprecision in certain results. Additional repolarization properties, such as QT dispersion, have been linked to sudden arrhythmic death in the general population. We could not confirm the increased prevalence of QT dispersion in at least one-third of people with chronic epilepsybecause the CLSA only reports conduction intervals.

PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia

Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg lacosamide. When lacosamide is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.

In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with Lacosamide, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. In all patients for whom a loading dose is clinically indicated, administer the loading dose with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including cardiovascular adverse reactions.

Regarding the use of lacosamide IV (also known as Vimpat, Vimpat) in patients with eGFR 10–30 mL/min/1.73 m²:
- Maximal dose of 250 mg. Do not exceed frequency of q24h.
- Titrate slowly.

### Lacosamide (lacosamide oral solution) [^112YRz2S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lacosamide oral solution should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). Lacosamide oral solution should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning Lacosamide oral solution, and after Lacosamide oral solution is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide oral solution administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

### Lacosamide [^1115key4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses.

Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with tmax. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at tmax) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the patients, according to treatment group.

Figure 1
One hundred and fifty-six patients were identified for study inclusion. Of these patients, 86 were excluded. Patients were excluded if medications of interest were home medications (n = 56), ordered but never given (n = 22) or used for another indication (n = 3). Patients who presented in status epilepticus were also excluded (n = 5). This left 52 patients in the phenytoin group and 18 patients in the lacosamide group for analysis.

Thirteen patients (25%) failed therapy with phenytoin while four patients (22%) failed therapy with lacosamide (p = 1) (table 2). Treatment failure was determined by recurrent seizures captured by continuous EEG monitoring in 12 patients (92%) in the phenytoin group and 3 patients (75%) in the lacosamide group. Lacosamide was added as the third AED in 84.6% of patients who failed phenytoin. For those patients who failed treatment with lacosamide, phenytoin was added as the third AED 50% of the time and valproic acid was used the other 50% of the time. Benzodiazepines were ultimately used for seizure control in 21% of patients in the phenytoin group and 11% in the lacosamide group. Of the benzodiazepines, lorazepam was used most often (69%). Hypotension occurred in 55% of patients in the phenytoin group and 36% of patients in the lacosamide group (p = 0.198) (table 3). The mean drop in SBP was 20.9 mm Hg in the phenytoin group and 9.8 mm Hg in the lacosamide group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.019). Six patients in the phenytoin group had clinically significant hypotension (SBP < 80 mm Hg) with four of these patients requiring vasopressor therapy immediately after the administration of phenytoin. In the phenytoin group, bradycardia and LFT elevation occurred in 9.8% and 29% of patients, respectively. There were no incidences of bradycardia or LFT elevation in the lacosamide group. Out of the 46 patients with ECG completed in the phenytoin group, there were no incidences of PR interval prolongation. However, 1 patient out of the 15 patients (6.7%) with ECG completed in the lacosamide group experienced PR prolongation.

### Clinical perspectives on lacosamide [^116oYbDS]. Epilepsy Currents (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the advent of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) over the past 15 years, the treatment of uncontrolled partial-onset seizures remains a dilemma for clinicians. The most recent AEDs offer new mechanisms of action and more favorable safety profiles than the first generation of AEDs. Lacosamide (LCM) is the latest AED awaiting approval by the FDA for adjunctive use in partial-onset seizures. It differs from all other approved AEDs in that it has two novel mechanisms of action and favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The purposes of this article are to present the significant parameters for its use in clinical practice, by summarizing the preliminary results of phase II and III clinical trials, and to compare its efficacy data with other second-generation AEDs.

The Warning States That Lamotrigine Could Pose a Risk to People With Underlying Cardiac Disease and Not Healthy Individuals. Should I be Performing EKGs in My Healthy Patients to Look for Underlying Cardiac Disease?

The risk of undiagnosed asymptomatic cardiac disease under the age of 60 years is minimal in the absence of major cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, familial hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. In people over the age of 60 years, the likelihood of undiagnosed cardiac conduction abnormalities increases, and an EKG may be considered prior to initiating lamotrigine. An EKG should also be considered in people younger than 60 with known cardiac disease or significant risk factors as above.

### Cardiac conduction delay for sodium channel antagonist antiseizure medications: an analysis of the Canadian longitudinal study on aging [^1132bErE]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

People with epilepsy are at risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Whether this association results from epilepsy, antiseizure medications (ASMs) such as sodium channel blockers (NABs), or other factors has not been systematically assessed. The aims of this study were to quantify the odds of cardiac conduction delays (CCDs) on electrocardiogram in older people with active epilepsy using vs not using NABs, to determine the prevalence of CCDs by NABs, and to examine the association of demographic and clinical factors with CCDs.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. We defined active epilepsy as self-reported epilepsy and taking ASM. Sodium channel blockers (NABs) were phenytoin, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or lacosamide. We compared CCDs between people with epilepsy using NABs and those not using NABs; determined the prevalence of CCDs by NAB type; and fitted a logistic regression model for each abnormal ECG outcome as a function of active epilepsy and NAB use while adjusting for demographics and clinical factors. Multiple imputations handled missing data (200 iterations).

Results

In total, 30,077 people, with mean age 63.0 (10.25) years and 50.9% female, were studied, including 141 people with active epilepsy who used NABs, 68 who did not use NABs, and 29,868 who did not have active epilepsy. Demographics between groups and relative to people without epilepsy were similar. People with active epilepsy taking NABs were more likely to have prolonged QRS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85 [95% CI 1.09–7.43]) and any CCD (1.94 [1.03–3.63]) compared with those with active epilepsy without NAB. After adjusting for Framingham score and heart rate–lowering medications, NAB use was associated with prolonged QTc (OR = 1.52 [95% CI 1.06–2.18]) and any CCD (1.78 [1.16, 2.74]). The prevalence of any CCD was 36.1% [95% CI 24.2%–49.4%] for carbamazepine, 45.5% [31.7%–58.5%] for phenytoin, and 54.7% [28.9%–75.6%] lamotrigine. Epilepsy was not associated with any CCD.

Discussion

People with active epilepsy using NABs more commonly have CCDs. NAB use is associated with CCD, whereas active epilepsy is not.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Events reported after an intake of more than 800 mg (twice the maximum recommended daily dosage) of lacosamide include dizziness, nausea, and seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have occurred following lacosamide overdoses of several grams.

There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Standard decontamination procedures should be followed. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of patient. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with lacosamide.

Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of lacosamide (reduction of systemic exposure by 50% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis may be indicated based on the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.

Are There Any Data That Arrhythmias or Sudden Deaths Due to Cardiac Issues Are More Common in People on Lamotrigine Compared to Other Anti-Seizure Medications?

To our knowledge, an increased risk of arrhythmias or sudden deaths due to cardiac issues or need for pacemaker therapy in people on lamotrigine as compared to other anti-seizure medications (ASMs) has not been demonstrated. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is, however, relatively common in people with epilepsy. In adults with epilepsy, the overall rate of SUDEP is approximately 1:1000/year, but the risk is higher in people with frequent convulsive seizures. Thus, an increase in sudden cardiac death caused by lamotrigine could theoretically be missed if it occurred at a very low frequency in relation to SUDEP risk.

### Antiepileptic drugs in critically ill patients [^114qJBtj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Selection of the most appropriate AED in the ICU setting can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Older AEDs such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbital are often used by clinicians due to their familiarity with these agents, intravenous formulations, and availability of evidence in certain clinical scenarios. Despite this, adverse effects of these agents, drug-drug interactions, and the need for TDM may limit their use. Newer agents such as levetiracetam and lacosamide are gaining popularity due to their relatively safe AED profile, fewer drug-drug interactions, and lack of need for TDM. The efficacy of these agents for seizure prophylaxis and as second-line treatment for SE, however, should be further evaluated in large randomized clinical trials.

### Cardiac conduction delay for sodium channel antagonist antiseizure medications: an analysis of the Canadian longitudinal study on aging [^115paSJQ]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our exposure of interest was active epilepsy. A previously developed diagnostic algorithm using the CLSA to identify individuals with active epilepsy was considered. This algorithm uses self-reported information on epilepsy diagnosis, ASM use, and epilepsy-related symptoms to identify people with active epilepsy (sensitivity > 99%, specificity > 98%). Applying this algorithm directly to baseline data was not feasible given its introduction with the first 3-year follow-up (conducted between 2015 and 2018). We defined individuals with active epilepsy as either (1) those with a positive algorithm screen at the first follow-up and who took an ASM at baseline or (2) those at baseline who reported having a history of epilepsy (a single self-report question, "Has a doctor ever told you that you have epilepsy?") and took an ASM. Some people who reported having epilepsy at the follow-up provided their age at seizure onset. If they reported developing epilepsy within the past 3 years (i.e. between the baseline and first follow-up), their screen was considered negative.

Other variables of interest (all measured at baseline) included age, sex, ethnicity, household income, level of education, Framingham cardiovascular risk score, ASM use, NAB use, and heart rate–lowering medication use. NABs were phenytoin, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and lacosamide. No individuals in the sample used eslicarbazepine, rufinamide, or felbamate. Heart rate–lowering medications were β-blockers and calcium channel blockers.

2.6 Administration Instructions for VIMPAT Tablets and Oral Solution

VIMPAT tablets and oral solution may be taken with or without food.

VIMPAT Tablets

VIMPAT tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid. Do not divide VIMPAT tablets.

VIMPAT Oral Solution

A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.

VIMPAT oral solution may also be administered using a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube.

Discard any unused VIMPAT oral solution remaining after 6 months of first opening the bottle.

2.7 Preparation and Administration Information for VIMPAT Injection

Preparation

VIMPAT injection can be administered intravenously without further dilution or may be mixed with diluents listed below. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at room temperature.

Diluents:

Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% (w/v)

Dextrose Injection 5% (w/v)

Lactated Ringer's Injection

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used.

VIMPAT injection is for single-dose only. Any unused portion of VIMPAT injection should be discarded.

Administration

The recommended infusion duration is 30 to 60 minutes; however, infusions as rapid as 15 minutes can be administered in adults if required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Infusion durations less than 30 minutes are generally not recommended in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Intravenous infusion of VIMPAT may cause bradycardia, AV blocks, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose is recommended in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions or on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Storage and Stability

The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at room temperature. Any unused portion of VIMPAT injection should be discarded.

2.8 Discontinuation of VIMPAT

When discontinuing VIMPAT, a gradual withdrawal over at least 1 week is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Retrospective multicenter cohort study on safety and electroencephalographic response to lacosamide for neonatal seizures [^111V613w]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of lacosamide in older children. However, minimal data are available for neonates. We aimed to determine the incidence of adverse events associated with lacosamide use and explore the electroencephalographic seizure response to lacosamide in neonates.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from seven pediatric hospitals from January 2009 to February 2020. For safety outcomes, neonates were followed for ≤ 30 days from index date. Electroencephalographic response of lacosamide was evaluated based on electroencephalographic reports for ≤ 3 days.

Results

Among 47 neonates, 98% received the first lacosamide dose in the intensive care units. During the median follow-up of 12 days, 19% of neonates died, and the crude incidence rate per 1000 patient-days (95% confidence interval) of the adverse events by diagnostic categories ranged from 2.8 (0.3, 10.2) for blood or lymphatic system disorders and nervous system disorders to 10.5 (4.2, 21.6) for cardiac disorders. Electroencephalographic seizures were observed in 31 of 34 patients with available electroencephalographic data on the index date. There was seizure improvement in 29% of neonates on day 1 and also in 29% of neonates on day 2. On day 3, there was no change in 50% of neonates and unknown change in 50% of neonates.

Conclusions

The results are reassuring regarding the safety of lacosamide in neonates. Although some neonates had fewer seizures after lacosamide administration, the lack of a comparator arm and reliance on qualitative statements in electroencephalographic reports limit the preliminary efficacy results.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lamotrigine PO (also known as Lamictal):
- **Blood dyscrasias, aseptic meningitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lamotrigine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: use caution in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease. Recognize that concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may firther increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
- **Decreased serum lamotrigine levels**: use caution in patients taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjust lamotrigine dosage in patients initiating or discontinuing estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
- **DRESS syndrome**: use caution in all patients. Recognize that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever and lymphadenopathy, may be present even though a rash is not evident. Instruct patients to report any rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity.
- **Seizure**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Suicidal ideation**: use caution in all patients. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior.

Once an Individual Is on Lamotrigine, Does the EKG Need to be Repeated?

If used in people at risk, a repeat EKG should be considered at the target dose, mainly when the target dose (or the serum lamotrigine level) is near or above the upper limit of the therapeutic range, and always in the presence of concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers or substances known to impair atrio-ventricular and/or intra-ventricular cardiac conduction. Because concomitant use of such drugs put people at increased risk for impaired cardiac conduction when adding lamotrigine, an initial EKG should also be performed.

7.1 Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to VIMPAT. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.

7.2 Concomitant Medications that Affect Cardiac Conduction

VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

5.4 Syncope

In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.

5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)

As with all AEDs, lacosamide should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including lacosamide. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lacosamide should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

### FDA safety warning on the cardiac effects of lamotrigine: an advisory from the Ad hoc ILAE / AES task force [^112G1QFD]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Have Human Studies Been Performed to Evaluate This?

While in vitro data indicate lamotrigine has Class IB antiarrhythmic sodium channel blocking properties, there is no change in ventricular conduction (QRS duration) in healthy individualsand individuals with epilepsy without heart disease. A modest increase in the atrioventricular conduction interval (PR prolongation) may occur, especially at high doses. Significantly, unlike Class IA anti-arrhythmic drugs, lamotrigine does not prolong repolarization (no change in QT) in healthy people at thorough QT testing. At high doses of lamotrigine, there is a mild QT shortening observed, which is a Class IB property. Thus, based on the absence of QRS or QT changes, and only mild PR prolongation even at high doses, there is not an apparent arrhythmia risk of lamotrigine therapy in healthy people without heart disease. It should also be noted that the Class IB antiarrhythmic drugs lidocaine and mexiletine have a long record of use in people with ischemic heart disease.

### Ranolazine toxicity precipitating seizure in the elderly [^114fRARr]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

An 80+ year old woman with stage III chronic kidney disease presented after having an episode of sudden stiffening, shaking and confusion. This was the third such episode that the patient had in the past 4weeks, and the patient has never had such an episo de previously. Of note, she was prescribed ranolazine for chronic angina 6weeks prior. She initially started taking 500mg two times per day which was subsequently increased to 1000 two times per day. Laboratory work up revealed an elevated creatinine of 2.42 compared with baseline of 1.9. Imaging studies revealed no acute findings suggestive of stroke. Electroencephalogram demonstrated seizure activity, and lacosamide 100mg two times per day was prescribed. During her hospital stay, ranolazine was discontinued and the patient gradually returned to her mental baseline. This case demonstrates ranolazine toxicity that manifests as new-onset epilepsy which is more likely to occur in the elderly and patients with renal dysfunction.

### Safety and efficiency of intravenous push lacosamide administration [^116vJSYk]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Intravenous (IV) lacosamide use for status epilepticus has increased in recent years and is recommended for refractory status epilepticus by current guidelines. Per the lacosamide package labeling, the preferred route of administration is diluted and infused over 30–60 min; however, administration undiluted is also acceptable and recent literature demonstrated safety at a maximum rate of 80 mg per minute (Kellinghaus et al. in Acta Neurol Scand 123:137–141, 2011). Undiluted administration as an IV push has potential to increase efficiency of administration to patients needing urgent seizure control since it may be dispensed from automatic dispensing cabinets in patient care areas. This study aims to compare safety outcomes and efficiency of administration in patients receiving lacosamide IV push compared to IV piggyback.

Methods

We present a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients receiving lacosamide via IV piggyback or IV push from June 2016 to July 2017. Baseline characteristics, data related to potential safety concerns and timing of ordering, verification, and administration were collected. The primary safety outcomes were incidence of infusion site reactions, hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 90 mm Hg), and bradycardia (heart rate [HR] < 50 beats per minute) documented within 2 h of each lacosamide dose. Secondary safety outcomes included the incidence of PR interval prolongation in patients with at least one electrocardiogram measured. The primary efficiency outcome was the time between order verification and administration.

Results

Patients in the IV piggyback (n = 88) and IV push (n = 78) groups had similar baseline characteristics, initial dose, SBP, and HR. Hypotension (8 vs. 10.3%) and bradycardia (2.3 vs. 2.6%) rates were similar among both groups (p > 0.05). Only one patient in each group had documented PR prolongation, and no documented infusion reactions occurred. Median time from order verification to administration was significantly reduced in the IV push group (35 min vs. 1 h 49 min; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Administration of lacosamide via IV push results in similar adverse effect rates to IV piggyback preparations with more efficient time to administration.

### Lacosamide (Vimpat) [^112FL1yP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). VIMPAT should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lacosamide PO (also known as Vimpat, Vimpat):
- **AF, atrial flutter**: use caution in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or CVD.
- **Ataxia, dizziness**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lacosamide is assoiciated with an increased risk of adverse events.
- **Exacerbation of AV block, ventricular arrhythmias**: use caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial ischemia or HF, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome).
- **Exacerbation of drug withdrawal syndrome, seizure**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients with seizure disorders.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lacosamide is associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Syncope**: use caution in patients with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.

### Lacosamide (Vimpat) [^1178A9bF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia

Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. When VIMPAT is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.

In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with VIMPAT, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. In all patients for whom a loading dose is clinically indicated, administer the loading dose with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including cardiovascular adverse reactions.

5.4 Syncope

In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with VIMPAT reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.

5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)

As with all AEDs, VIMPAT should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including VIMPAT. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. VIMPAT should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

### Cardiac conduction delay for sodium channel antagonist antiseizure medications: an analysis of the Canadian longitudinal study on aging [^115wV4Rb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We compared the prevalence of CCD on ECG between people with active epilepsy using NAB or not on a baseline ECG. We also characterized the CCD types across various NABs. Finally, we examined the association and importance of demographic and clinical factors with CCD. Our findings suggest that NAB use, rather than active epilepsy, is associated with CCD.

The overlap between epilepsy and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been characterized for several outcomes, including the increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, ischemic events, and potential genetic risk factors. Characteristics of epilepsy, other comorbidities, and ASMs influence the occurrence of cardiovascular events. ASMs have drawn interest as clinicians may modify ASM regimens. A population-based study in Wales reported that people with epilepsy on ASM treatment have a greater risk of major cardiovascular events than population-based controls. A Finnish prospective case-control study found a higher rate of SCD among ASM users. An English population-based study suggested a dose-dependent increased hazard of incident CVD for people using EIASMs. The Welsh study and a Japanese retrospective cohort study found no such association. A retrospective case-control cohort reported that carbamazepine and valproic acid are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events relative to lamotrigine. ASMs also influence the risk of arrhythmias. Carbamazepine and valproic acid (VPA) are associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, existing evidence has been equivocal. An administrative claims database study using propensity score weighting highlighted that the combined end point of SCD and ventricular arrhythmia was less frequent in adults with newly prescribed levetiracetam than those prescribed oxcarbazepine. A systematic review indicated that lacosamide users had a significantly higher risk of arrhythmias, whereas those using levetiracetam did not. Another found insufficient evidence to support or refute an association between lamotrigine and sudden death or ECG changes. A strong focus on the sodium channel is warranted because of the role of the sodium channel variations and NABs in promoting CCDs and arrhythmias.

### Lacosamide oral solution [^112bkW6Q]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to lacosamide oral solution. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.

7.2 Concomitant Medications that Affect Cardiac Conduction

Lacosamide oral solution should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide oral solution, and after lacosamide oral solution is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Often ASMs Need to be Initiated as Quickly as Possible After a Diagnosis of Epilepsy Is Made. Do I Have to Wait to Start Lamotrigine Until I Obtain the Results of the EKG?

In most cases the initial EKG can be obtained while titrating, mainly when the individual is at the first dose of 25 mg/d because lamotrigine must be titrated slowly, and because cardiac adverse events are dose-related.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^115xJ9ng]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected ventricular arrhythmias — history and physical examination emphasize symptom characterization and specific risk clues: Palpitations, presyncope, and syncope are the 3 most important symptoms requiring further characterization, with palpitations usually of a sudden onset/offset pattern and sometimes associated with presyncope and/or syncope. Sudden episodes of collapse with loss of consciousness without premonition that usually last for a few seconds must raise suspicion of conduction defects or ventricular arrhythmias, and other symptoms of structural heart disease such as chest discomfort, dyspnea, and fatigue may be present. A thorough drug history including dosages used must be obtained, and a positive family history of sudden cardiac death is a strong independent predictor of susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Physical examination is often unrevealing unless the arrhythmia occurs during examination or other findings indicate structural heart disease.

### Lacosamide (Motpoly xr) [^113AXKjv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanism by which MOTPOLY XR exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day(equal to and two times the maximum recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with tmax. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at tmax) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Lacosamide in Adults

In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1327 adult patients received lacosamide tablets in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months. The monotherapy development program for partial-onset seizures included 425 adult patients, 310 of whom were treated for longer than 6 months, and 254 for longer than 12 months.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Monotherapy Historical-Control Trial (Study 1)

In the monotherapy trial for partial-onset seizures, 16% of patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 300 and 400 mg/day discontinued from the trial as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reaction most commonly (≥ 1% on lacosamide) leading to discontinuation was dizziness.

Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of ≥ 2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Because this study did not include a placebo control group, causality could not be established.

### Sudden death and cardiac arrythmia with lamotrigine: a rapid systematic review [^116GFu8o]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

A recent Food and Drug Administration warning concerning an arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine created concern in the neurologic community. This warning was based on in vitro studies, but no clinically relevant risk was considered. This rapid systematic review aims to elucidate the risk of lamotrigine on sudden death or ECG abnormalities.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies and studies of people with or without epilepsy, with the outcome measures sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) or sudden cardiac death as well as the development or worsening of ECG abnormalities. We evaluated the sudden death definitions used in all included studies, as some could have used unclear or overlapping definitions. We used the American Academy of Neurology risk of bias tool to evaluate the class of evidence and the GRADE approach to evaluate our confidence in the evidence.

Results

We included 26 studies with 24,962 participants, of whom 2,326 used lamotrigine. Twelve studies showed no significant risk of SUDEP for lamotrigine users. One study reporting on sudden cardiac death and 3 studies with unclear sudden death definitions did not report an elevated risk of death in lamotrigine users compared to controls. In 10 studies reporting on ECG measures, there was no statistically significant increased risk among lamotrigine users except in 2 studies. These 2 studies reported either "slight increases" in PR interval or an increased PQ interval that the primary study authors believed to be related to structural cardiac differences rather than an effect of lamotrigine. One study was rated Class II; all others were Class III or IV. We had very low confidence in the evidence following the GRADE assessment. None of the studies examined the risk of lamotrigine in people with preexisting cardiac conditions.

Discussion

There is insufficient evidence to support or refute that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death or ECG changes in people with or without epilepsy as compared to antiseizure medication or placebo, due to the high risk of bias in most studies and low precision and inconsistency in the reported results.

### Lacosamide: a study of exposures reported to US poison centers over a 9-year period [^1166qmWE]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lacosamide (Vimpat®) is an anticonvulsant used to treat partial-onset seizures. Little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of patients exposed to lacosamide.

Objective

To characterize lacosamide exposures reported to US poison centers with regard to patient demographics, clinical effects, and outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective observational study queried the National Poison Data System (NPDS) for single substance lacosamide exposures from January 2008 to December 2016. Variables of interest included age, gender, medical outcome, management site, level of healthcare facility, reason for exposure, and clinical effects.

Results

Lacosamide exposures were identified in 1124 patients, ranging from ages 2 months to 99 years. Six hundred and twenty-two patients (55.3%) were female. Nine hundred and seventy-six patients (86.8%) had minimal or no toxic effects. Life-threatening exposures numbered 30 cases (2.7%). There was one death. Five hundred and forty-eight patients (48.8%) did not require healthcare management while 537 (47.7%) were either referred to or already at a hospital. Among those treated at a healthcare facility, 269 (50.1%) did not require admission. Thirty-three patients (6.1%) were admitted to a psychiatric facility, 68 (12.7%) to a non-critical care unit, and 93 (17.3%) to a critical care unit. Six hundred and thirty-two exposures (56.2%) were due to therapeutic error. Suicide attempts numbered 168 (14.9%). Neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms were commonly encountered.

Conclusion

Lacosamide exposures infrequently cause death or disability; however, a considerable proportion of the study population required intensive care. Exposed patients with symptoms require healthcare evaluation.

Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. MOTPOLY XR administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

5.4 Syncope

In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.

5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)

As with all AEDs, MOTPOLY XR should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

### The assessment of cardiac risk in patients taking lamotrigine; a systematic review [^115mVn2A]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about lamotrigine's arrhythmogenicity based on in vitro data. This systematic review investigates lamotrigine's effect on cardiac conduction and risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We searched Web of Science and PubMed from inception through August 2021. We included studies measuring electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, laboratory abnormalities, or SCD among patients taking lamotrigine. Studies examining sudden unexpected death in epilepsy were excluded for scope. Two reviewers assessed articles and extracted data. We used the Effective Public Healthcare Panacea Project tool to evaluate confidence in evidence.

Results

Eight randomized controlled trials, 9 nonrandomized observational studies, and 24 case reports were identified, with > 3054 total participants, > 1606 of whom used lamotrigine. One randomized trial of older patients found an average QRS increase of 3.5 ± 13.1 ms. Fifteen studies reported no changes in ECG parameters. Case reports documented QRS widening (13), Brugada syndrome (6), QTc prolongation (1) and SCD (2), though many ingested toxic quantities of lamotrigine and/or other medications.

Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient to support the breadth of the FDA warning concerning lamotrigine's cardiac risk. Lamotrigine at therapeutic doses may be associated with modest, non-dangerous QRS widening.

Advise the patient or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). The Medication Guide accompanies the product and can also be accessed on www.vimpat.com or by calling 1–844–599–2273.

Suicidal Thinking and Behavior

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including VIMPAT, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Dizziness and Ataxia

Patients should be counseled that VIMPAT use may cause dizziness, double vision, abnormal coordination and balance, and somnolence. Patients taking VIMPAT should be advised not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with VIMPAT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities

Patients should be counseled that VIMPAT is associated with electrocardiographic changes that may predispose to irregular heart beat and syncope. Cardiac arrest has been reported. This risk is increased in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, with heart conduction problems, or who are taking other medications that affect the heart. Patients should be made aware of and report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider right away. Patients who develop syncope should lay down with raised legs and contact their health care provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity

Patients should be aware that VIMPAT may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions affecting multiple organs such as the liver and kidney. VIMPAT should be discontinued if a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Patients should also be instructed to report promptly to their physicians any symptoms of liver toxicity (e.g., fatigue, jaundice, dark urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Neonatal cardiac arrest following lacosamide treatment: a case report [^116acGTE]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug with US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients older than one month. Lacosamide works by selective enhancement of proteins that induce preferential slow promotion of sodium channels to the hyperpolarized inactive state. Lacosamide is generally well-tolerated; however, clinical and nonclinical studies have linked its use with cardiac side effects including PR prolongation and atrioventricular (AV) block.

Results

We present the case of a three-week-old female neonatal patient born at 25 weeks' gestation who developed second-degree AV heart block and cardiac arrest after initiating lacosamide therapy. The patient was being treated for neonatal seizure complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage (grade II) and electrolyte disturbances with phenobarbital, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Before addition of lacosamide therapy, the patient had an unremarkable electrocardiogram and no known cardiac risk factors for lacosamide. After medication discontinuation, the patient experienced no reoccurring episodes or other cardiac events.

Conclusion

Use of lacosamide for neonatal populations is currently under evaluation. This is the first report of adverse cardiac event (AV block) in the setting of neonatal lacosamide use. Risk of future adverse cardiac events should be evaluated when determining the safety and efficacy of lacosamide in the neonatal population.

### Lacosamide oral solution [^1145zqap]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lacosamide oral solution should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). Lacosamide oral solution should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide oral solution, and after lacosamide oral solution is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide oral solution in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide oral solution is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide oral solution experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide oral solution administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

### FDA safety warning on the cardiac effects of lamotrigine: an advisory from the Ad hoc ILAE / AES task force [^116qFEWK]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Are These Warnings and Precautions Only Relevant to Lamotrigine or Are They Also Applicable for Other Sodium Channel Blockers?

The cardiac concerns stem from lamotrigine's sodium channel blocking properties. No differences in the occurrence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities have been reported in 2 small studies that compared lamotrigine with carbamazepine, including specifically elderly individuals with epilepsy. However, we are not aware of any head-to-head comparative thorough clinical study of the effects of lamotrigine and other sodium channel blockers on cardiac electrophysiology. A synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction with other substances with sodium channel blocking properties may be expected, and potentially increase the risk for adverse cardiac effects (see also item #10).

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to Lacosamide oral solution. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.

7.2 Concomitant Medications that Affect Cardiac Conduction

Lacosamide oral solution should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning Lacosamide oral solution, and after Lacosamide oral solution is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Lacosamide (Vimpat) [^115jgRuR]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lacosamide IV (also known as Vimpat, Vimpat):
- **AF, atrial flutter**: use caution in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or CVD.
- **Ataxia, dizziness**: use caution in patients taking higher dosage of lacosamide.
- **AV block, ventricular arrhythmias**: use caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, β-blockers, CCBs, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval.
- **Exacerbation of AV block, ventricular arrhythmias**: use caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial ischemia or HF, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome).
- **Exacerbation of drug withdrawal syndrome, seizures**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients with seizure disorders.
- **Intravenous drug abuse**: use caution in patients with a history of substance abuse.
- **Suicidal ideation**: use caution in all patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs.
- **Syncope**: use caution in patients with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.
