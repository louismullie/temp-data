## Question

Lactic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lactic acid and lactate, specifically wanting to understand their fundamental chemistry and physiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental chemistry and physiology of lactic acid versus lactate. Then, I should verify the modern lactate shuttle concept and its clinical implications. Next, I will classify the etiologies of hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis, followed by a careful review of sepsis-specific pathophysiology. After that, I should examine clinical interpretation, thresholds, and lactate kinetics. Then, I will appraise treatment strategies, including the role of bicarbonate and emerging lactate-based therapies. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical clinical approach with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the basic chemistry and physiology, because mislabeling lactic acid versus lactate leads to persistent misconceptions. Lactic acid is the protonated form (CH3CHOHCOOH), whereas lactate is the deprotonated anion (CH3CHOHCOO−); clinically we measure blood lactate, and lactate is continuously produced even under aerobic conditions as a normal metabolic intermediate, not merely a waste product of anaerobiosis [^1165Zzy8] [^112i4Pxz].

> Wait, let me verify the lactate shuttle concept before I overstate anaerobic paradigms. The cell-to-cell lactate shuttle describes lactate as a mobile energy substrate and signaling molecule, shuttled from producer to consumer tissues where it is oxidized or used for gluconeogenesis; this reframes lactatemia as a marker of metabolic strain rather than solely hypoxia, and it underpins emerging therapeutic interest in exogenous lactate [^112i4Pxz] [^116k9zdn] [^116fE1kY].

> I need to check the classification next, because treatment hinges on etiology. Type A reflects overproduction due to inadequate oxygen delivery or utilization (shock, hypoxemia, severe anemia, CO poisoning), whereas Type B reflects altered metabolism or clearance without tissue hypoxia (sepsis-related dysregulation, liver disease, thiamine deficiency, mitochondrial disorders, malignancy, drugs) [^116kvqZe] [^113kkZht] [^1134BsJv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in sepsis; I should confirm the mixed mechanisms. In sepsis, hyperlactatemia arises from both increased production (catecholamine-driven aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction) and decreased clearance (hepatic hypoperfusion, impaired gluconeogenesis), so lactate is neither purely hypoxic nor purely non-hypoxic in sepsis, which complicates interpretation and mandates serial measurements and clinical correlation [^114RPu15] [^11136oJx] [^112cdM3e].

> Next, I should review clinical thresholds and kinetics, and I need to ensure I cite the right guidance. Commonly used cutoffs include greater than 2.0 mmol/L as abnormal and greater than 4.0 mmol/L as high risk. Lactate alone is insufficient to diagnose sepsis, but elevated levels increase mortality risk and are incorporated into Sepsis-3 shock criteria, with guidelines recommending lactate measurement in suspected sepsis and consideration of lactate-guided resuscitation when elevated [^114jA46a] [^112fEYSZ] [^111BdPwn] [^115asmtM]. I should double-check prognostic indices: dynamic measures such as time-weighted average lactate and absolute change over 24 hours outperform static values, and lactate clearance predicts mortality across heterogeneous critically ill populations, though optimal clearance targets and intervals vary by study [^114wvRJW] [^117HQegd] [^117XLtej].

> Let me consider treatment principles, and I should confirm guideline positions before recommending buffers. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause (restore perfusion, eradicate infection, remove toxins, correct metabolic derangements), while routine sodium bicarbonate is not recommended to improve hemodynamics or reduce vasopressor requirements in hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with pH greater than or equal to 7.15; for pH less than or equal to 7.2 with AKI, a weak recommendation exists, acknowledging low-quality evidence and potential harms from CO2 generation and intracellular acidosis [^112EiGWp] [^114V1MMK] [^113bMrZm]. But wait, what if we actively administer lactate rather than buffer acidosis? Emerging data suggest hypertonic sodium lactate may improve hemodynamics and organ function via metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects, though larger randomized trials are needed before routine adoption [^111LuCR2] [^116ykNbf] [^1173L1Yg].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts, and I should verify nuances. In metformin-associated lactic acidosis, prognosis is often better than other etiologies at similar pH, and timely renal replacement therapy is key; the absolute risk of MALA is low, and many cases reflect coincident hypoxic illness rather than direct metformin toxicity, so I need to avoid prematurely attributing causality [^113AwhYS] [^114JtgXm] [^1152sZf6]. In mitochondrial diseases, lactic acidemia is common and management is largely supportive with attention to precipitating crises; dichloroacetate can lower lactate but may cause neuropathy and is not curative, underscoring the need for cautious, individualized care [^112Lw7DC] [^114i5jzd]. In pediatrics, CSF lactate helps distinguish mitochondrial and infectious encephalopathies, but sample timing and seizure control matter to avoid false positives [^114X51qW] [^116EFuxB]. In trauma, elevated ED lactate correlates with mortality and organ failure, supporting its use as a severity marker even in the absence of overt hypotension [^115BfhLk].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines. Measure lactate early in suspected sepsis or shock, interpret in clinical context, and if elevated, repeat at 2–6 hour intervals to assess kinetics; a falling lactate supports effective resuscitation, whereas persistent elevation warrants re-evaluation of source control, perfusion, and clearance capacity. Avoid reflex bicarbonate unless severe acidemia with AKI is present, and consider lactate-guided resuscitation as an adjunct rather than a standalone target. Always ask "why is the lactate high?" and pursue the etiology rather than chasing the number alone [^114jA46a] [^115asmtM] [^111BdPwn] [^11173gbC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that lactate clearance itself improves outcomes. I should correct that. Lactate clearance is a prognostic marker of response to therapy, not a proven therapeutic target, and efforts to "force" clearance without addressing the cause are misguided; the clinical priority remains timely correction of hypoperfusion, infection, and metabolic derangements while using lactate trends to gauge trajectory and detect occult deterioration [^11136oJx] [^117XLtej] [^114jCT4Q].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The therapeutic use of exogenous lactate is promising but unproven at scale, lactate kinetics thresholds are not universally standardized, and confounders such as liver dysfunction, exogenous lactate, and adrenergic stimulation can obscure interpretation. Ongoing trials and consensus efforts should refine how and when to integrate lactate into goal-directed care without oversimplifying its biology [^111LuCR2] [^116ykNbf] [^112Ld1ix].

Lactic acid is produced from pyruvate by **lactate dehydrogenase** when oxygen supply is limited or mitochondrial function is impaired, generating lactate and H⁺ and contributing to metabolic acidosis [^1114zMju]. Elevated lactate (> 2 mmol/L) is a marker of tissue hypoperfusion or metabolic stress and is associated with higher mortality in sepsis, shock, and trauma; **serial lactate and lactate clearance** guide resuscitation and risk stratification [^112fEYSZ] [^117HQegd] [^115BfhLk]. Management focuses on correcting the underlying cause, restoring perfusion, and avoiding routine bicarbonate; lactate-guided therapy is recommended in sepsis, and emerging evidence suggests lactate may have therapeutic roles beyond being a biomarker [^115asmtM] [^111LuCR2].

---

## Physiological production and metabolism

- **Normal production**: Lactate is continuously produced under aerobic conditions, with ~1500 mmol/day generated and cleared primarily by the liver (~60%) and kidneys (~30%) [^111suThw].

- **Anaerobic glycolysis**: When oxygen delivery is inadequate, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, regenerating NAD⁺ to sustain glycolysis and ATP production [^114i5jzd].

- **Clearance**: Lactate is oxidized or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis; clearance is reduced in liver dysfunction and shock, worsening hyperlactatemia [^11136oJx].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated lactic acid

Elevated lactate (**hyperlactatemia**) reflects increased production, decreased clearance, or both, and is a marker of illness severity and mortality risk [^114jCT4Q].

| **Clinical context** | **Association with elevated lactate** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis and septic shock | Strong association with mortality and organ dysfunction | - Guides resuscitation <br/> - Risk stratification [^114jCT4Q] |
| Trauma | Associated with mortality, ICU admission, and organ failure | Prognostic marker and management guide [^115BfhLk] |
| Cardiogenic shock | Reflects impaired perfusion and metabolic stress | Prognostic marker and management guide [^114NYAFK] |
| Liver disease | Reduced clearance causes persistent hyperlactatemia | Indicates severity and prognosis [^notfound] |
| Mitochondrial disorders | Primary lactic acidosis due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation | Diagnostic marker and management guide [^112Lw7DC] |

---

## Measurement and interpretation

- **Measurement**: Blood lactate is measured by arterial or venous sampling; point-of-care devices enable rapid assessment [^114jA46a].

- **Normal values**: Typically 0.5–2.0 mmol/L; > 2.0 mmol/L is abnormal, and > 4.0 mmol/L with pH < 7.35 defines lactic acidosis [^1134BsJv].

- **Lactate clearance**: The rate of decline in lactate over time is a dynamic marker of response to therapy and is associated with improved outcomes [^117HQegd].

---

## Clinical management of elevated lactic acid

Management centers on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**, restoring perfusion, and supportive care.

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address hypoperfusion, infection, liver dysfunction, or mitochondrial disorders [^1134BsJv].

- **Restore perfusion**: Use fluids, vasopressors, and oxygen to improve oxygen delivery [^113i7p7o].

- **Avoid routine bicarbonate**: Not recommended for hemodynamic improvement in lactic acidosis; use only in select severe cases [^114V1MMK].

- **Lactate-guided therapy**: Serial lactate measurements guide resuscitation and are recommended in sepsis [^115asmtM].

## Emerging therapeutic roles of lactic acid

Recent research explores lactate as a **therapeutic agent** in critical illness, leveraging its metabolic and anti-inflammatory properties [^111LuCR2]. Hypertonic sodium lactate may improve hemodynamics, reduce inflammation, and enhance organ function in sepsis, heart failure, and brain injury, though larger trials are needed [^116ykNbf].

---

Lactic acid is a key metabolic intermediate; **elevated levels signal tissue hypoperfusion or metabolic stress** and correlate with worse outcomes. Management targets the cause and perfusion, with lactate-guided strategies improving care; emerging data suggest potential therapeutic uses for lactate beyond its role as a biomarker.

### Do lactate levels in the emergency department predict outcome in adult trauma patients? A systematic review [^115BfhLk]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Serum lactate may be associated with clinical outcomes in trauma, even in the absence of physiological abnormality. Sensitive markers of injury and outcomes are needed to guide triage and management of trauma patients within the Emergency Department. We completed a systematic review to determine if lactate levels in adult trauma patients presenting to the Emergency Department were associated with clinical outcomes including mortality.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in August 2014, updated in March 2016, using MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. Abstracts and full texts were screened for inclusion by two independent reviewers using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed by each reviewer using a standardized form. A total of 998 studies were screened; 28 studies were included and reviewed.

Results

The 28 studies recruited 44,154 adults in eight countries between 1997 and 2016. Twenty-one studies found a significant association between elevated Emergency Department lactate and risk of mortality. Three studies looked at lactate clearance; two showed poor clearance was an additional determinant of mortality, but the other found no association. Ten studies also found an association between elevated lactate and other clinical outcomes. These included injury severity, Intensive Care Unit admission, length of hospital stay, organ failure, respiratory complications, blood loss, blood product requirement, catecholamine support, or emergency operation. Two studies concluded that lactate levels do not affect management.

Conclusions

This review shows that elevated Emergency Department lactate levels are associated with mortality and may be associated with other clinical outcomes in adult trauma patients. We conclude that lactate is a useful marker of outcome in trauma, in addition to current markers of severity. The potential roles of serial lactate measurement and lactate clearance require further research.

### Lactic acid in alternative polarization and function of macrophages in tumor microenvironment [^112bMZaB]. Human Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

In developing tumor, macrophages are one major immune infiltrate that not only contributes in shaping up of tumor microenvironment (TME) but also have the potential of determining the fate of tumor in terms of its progression. Phenotypic plasticity of macrophages primarily channelizes them to alternative (M2) form of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in the TME. One of the key tumor derived components that plays a crucial role in TAM polarization from M1 to M2 form is lactic acid and has prominent role in progression of malignancy. The role of lactic acid as signalling molecule as well as an immunomodulator has recently been recognized. This review focuses on the mechanism and signalling that are involved in lactic acid induced M2 polarization and possible therapeutic strategies for regulating lactic acidosis in TME.

### Consideration of alternative causes of lactic acidosis: thiamine deficiency in malignancy [^112nzUo8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common metabolic acidosis characterized by increased serum lactate and is usually associated with a decreased blood pH. Lactic acidosis has many different causes but has been differentiated into type A, hypoxic causes, and type B, non-hypoxic causes. Tissue hypoxia, type A, is the most common cause, usually secondary to processes such as sepsis and multi-organ failure. Type A must be differentiated from type B in the correct clinical setting as treatments are vastly different. Type B causes may include drug side-effects, toxins, enzymatic defects, inherited or acquired, any of which may lead to overproduction or underutilization of lactate. However, as most clinicians are more familiar, and likely more initially concerned with hypoxic etiologies, evaluation is directed toward finding the source of hypoperfusion or hypoxia, and thus generally leading to a delay in discovering a type B cause (or mixed type A and type B). Here we describe a case of lactic acidosis in the setting of thiamine deficiency thought to be secondary to advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the clinician to consider other causes of lactic acidosis when evaluating a patient.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1133dUP1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is there any proven benefit of systemic alkalinization in severe metabolic (including lactic) acidosis?

Literature regarding the potential beneficial effect of alkalinization in correcting metabolic acidosis is controversial. As reported above, severe lactic acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15 appears to be experimentally detrimental for organ functions. Consequently, even if not formally demonstrated in clinical trials, it would appear reasonable to quickly correct the pH in order to restore cellular functions. In the absence of conclusive clinical studies, however, most of the following treatment options are consequently based on experimental data.

Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate has been removed from the treatment algorithm in advanced cardiac life support. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign also recommends against the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with severe lactic acidosis with pH > 7.15. Despite these strong guidelines, in the most recent survey on this topic, 67% of intensivists recommend administration of base to patients with metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. The blood pH at which base therapy should be initiated remains nonetheless controversial. Thirty-seven percent of these intensivists continue to begin symptomatic treatment of metabolic acidosis for a pH ≥ 7.1. Such discrepancy between the literature and bedside practice warrants further explanation.

Clinical studies investigating sodium bicarbonate therapy in situations of severe lactic acidosis have always reported an increase in extracellular pH whereas experimental data are more divergent. By contrast, intracellular pH always decreases after sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 1). The main explanation for this so-called paradoxical intracellular acidosis is based on the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with a proton to form water and carbon dioxide:

### Cancer-generated lactic acid: a regulatory, immunosuppressive metabolite? [^1147k4EC]. The Journal of Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

The common preference of cancers for lactic acid-generating metabolic energy pathways has led to proposals that their reprogrammed metabolism confers growth advantages such as decreased susceptibility to hypoxic stress. Recent observations, however, suggest that it generates a novel way for cancer survival. There is increasing evidence that cancers can escape immune destruction by suppressing the anti-cancer immune response through maintaining a relatively low pH in their micro-environment. Tumours achieve this by regulating lactic acid secretion via modification of glucose/glutamine metabolisms. We propose that the maintenance by cancers of a relatively low pH in their micro-environment, via regulation of their lactic acid secretion through selective modification of their energy metabolism, is another major mechanism by which cancers can suppress the anti-cancer immune response. Cancer-generated lactic acid could thus be viewed as a critical, immunosuppressive metabolite in the tumour micro-environment rather than a 'waste product'. This paradigm shift can have major impact on therapeutic strategy development. Copyright © 2013 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^115gPdzD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol.l −1 with a PaCO₂ ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### The role of lactate metabolism in heart failure and cardiogenic shock: clinical insights and therapeutic implications [^114NYAFK]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis, especially when it progresses to cardiogenic shock (CS), where survival rates substantially decline. A key area of interest is the role of blood lactate as a biomarker in these conditions. Lactate is produced under normal physiological conditions but increases with impaired tissue perfusion, a hallmark of HF and CS. Elevated lactate levels result from increased production, reduced clearance or both and are often associated with worse outcomes. Traditionally considered a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now recognized as an important energy substrate, particularly in myocardial tissue during periods of metabolic stress. Recent studies suggest that dynamic lactate monitoring, including lactate clearance (LC), may provide critical insights into patients' prognoses and responses to therapy. Serial measurements of lactate have been shown to predict survival in critically ill patients, including those with HF and CS. In CS, elevated lactate levels correlate with increased mortality risk, and LC is emerging as an important parameter in treatment protocols. Despite growing evidence of lactate's clinical relevance, research is needed to establish standardized thresholds and optimal monitoring timelines. Understanding the complexities of lactate metabolism and its role in HF and CS could lead to improved risk stratification and more personalized treatment approaches.

### Lactate in the critically ill patients: an outcome marker with the times [^114wvRJW]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic acid was first discovered in human blood in 1843. Since then it has been used as a prognosticator of outcome in critical illness. Regardless of its etiology, lactate's presence and trend over time have been shown to be independently associated with mortality. Two dynamic lactate measures, the time-weighted average lactate and the absolute change in lactate over the first 24 hours in the ICU, were recently shown to be better than static lactate measurements in predicting hospital and ICU deaths.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute mesenteric ischemia, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, ESTES 2016 guidelines recommend to do not use serum lactate levels for the diagnosis of AMI, as its normal value does not exclude the diagnosis.

### Treatment of metformin intoxication complicated by lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury: the role of prolonged intermittent hemodialysis [^1142xNVT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin intoxication with lactic acidosis, a potentially lethal condition, may develop in diabetic patients when the drug dose is inappropriate and/or its clearance is reduced. Diagnosis and therapy may be delayed due to nonspecific symptoms at presentation, with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated serum creatinine values being the most prominent laboratory findings. Confirmation requires measurement of serum metformin by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, but this technique is available only at specialized institutions and cannot be relied on as a guide to immediate treatment. Thus, based on strong clinical suspicion, renal replacement therapy must be started promptly to achieve efficient drug clearance and correct the metabolic acidosis. However, because metformin accumulates in the intracellular compartment with prolonged treatment, a rebound in serum concentrations due to redistribution is expected at the end of dialysis. We report a case of metformin intoxication, severe lactic acidosis, and acute kidney injury in a diabetic patient with pre-existing chronic kidney disease stage 3, treated effectively with sustained low-efficiency dialysis. We discuss the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment options and highlight specific pharmacokinetic issues that should be considered in selecting the appropriate modality of renal replacement therapy.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^114ASKk6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There were several interesting but unexpected findings in this study. First, a higher peak level of serum creatinine was associated with favorable survival. Indeed, apparent renal failure may help clinicians generate a high index of suspicion for MALA with appropriate evaluation resulting in earlier diagnosis and expedient delivery of RRT. On the other hand, patients with higher serum creatinine level at the initial presentation may also have a relatively indolent disease course rather than an acute episode of fulminant metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse. However, our data was not sufficient to determine whether the timing of RRT was early or late as it is difficult, if not impossible, to define the onset of MALA. Second, female patients had a better survival than male patients. Although it is likely that the efficiency of RRT may be better among female patients due to smaller body size, the information of body mass index (BMI) was rarely available in the published reports. Future prospective research is warranted to clarify the sex difference or the effect of BMI.

Limitation

Although the comprehensive nature of this systematic review can be interpreted as strength, several limitations deserve particular mention in the current work. Publication bias is a critical concern in this study as severe cases with unexpected favorable outcomes may be more likely reported by clinicians and accepted by medical journals. We compared the mortality rate of selected MALA patients between 1995 and 2010 with those from a pharmacovigilence database covering the same time span and the results were not too different (17.7% vs. 25%). The much lower mortality in our study population compared to the historical series may reflect the efficient support role of the RRT in maintaining the acid-base homeostasis in MALA. On the other hand, misclassification of the diagnosis of MALA can not be completely excluded. However, as all enrolled reports were peer-reviewed, misdiagnosis of MALA may be minimized. Residual confounding, especially unknown or unmeasured confounding, is another serious concern in this study. For example, it is not possible to standardize the onset and severity of MALA among the retrospectively enrolled cases to determine whether the intervention of RRT is early or late. Subsequently, the conclusions drawn from this study regarding the determinants of mortality are very limited to infer causality and generalizability. However, this real-world issue may not be completely avoided by prospective studies. Considering the rarity and severity of MALA, systematically analyzing case reports in the literature may be a realistic approach to describe the practice pattern and trend of RRT use in MALA.

### Recognizing and managing a metabolic crisis [^1158q6QZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

In some relatively common inborn errors of metabolism there can be the accumulation of toxic compounds including ammonia and organic acids such as lactate and ketoacids, as well as energy deficits at the cellular level. The clinical presentation is often referred to as a metabolic emergency or crisis. Fasting and illness can result in encephalopathy within hours, and without appropriate recognition and intervention, the outcome may be permanent disability or death. This review outlines easy and readily available means of recognizing and diagnosing a metabolic emergency as well as general guidelines for management. Disease-specific interventions focus on parenteral nutrition to reverse catabolism, toxin removal strategies, and vitamin/nutrition supplementation.

### Guiding resuscitation in shock: base excess or lactate? [^1127cPxL]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast to lactate, BE was able to provide an instant and inexpensive quantification of a metabolic acidosis, occurring, for example, during circulatory shock. Unsurprisingly, in this context, many researchers considered BE a surrogate indicator of oxygen debt and hypovolemia. BE was ideal in the predominantly healthy traumatology population: a single surrogate marker for hemorrhagic shock severity that could be used as a therapeutic trigger for transfusion management. Investigations demonstrated that BE was more accurate at quantifying the magnitude of blood loss during hemorrhagic shock than clinicians' visual estimates of blood loss, volume replacement counts, blood pressure, or heart rate.

Development of refined electrode-based lactate measurement methods enabled direct and rapid assessment, starting the era of routine lactate measurement in the 1980s. Nonetheless, some authors deemed lactate as clinically less useful than BE because of potential confounding factors: inflammation, sympathetic stimulation, drugs such as metformin, hepatic failure, and exogenous lactate may all lead to a hyperlactatemia in the absence of oxygen debt. Moreover, lactate normalization depends on its clearance and may be delayed despite effective resuscitative measures. Indeed, hyperlactatemia may reflect other pathophysiological mechanisms unrelated to hemorrhagic shock. However, any increase in endogenous lactate, by definition, leads to a decrease in BE. Moreover, BE is a composite marker and may be influenced by more factors than only hyperlactatemia: changes in strong electrolytes, such as sodium and chloride, weak acids, such as albumin or phosphate, and other unmeasured acids, such as ketones and toxins. Notably, resuscitation with a 0.9% saline solution leads to a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis with a decreased BE.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^116fE1kY]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of intensive care medicine, researchers and clinicians are continually exploring novel approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Among the emerging therapeutic strategies, the use of lactate has garnered increasing attention for its multifaceted role in cellular metabolism and its potential to serve as a valuable tool in managing critically ill patients. It has traditionally been viewed as a metabolic waste product associated with anaerobic metabolism, and circulating lactate is often a strong predictor of disease severity. However, the production of lactate is not only confined to anaerobic conditions but it is recognized as an energy intermediate, produced in tissues with high glycolytic activity (during exercise for example), which can then be transported throughout the body to be oxidized in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart and brain. This paradigm shift called "cell-to-cell lactate shuttle", introduced by Brooks in 2007, has led to a deeper understanding of lactate's therapeutic potential, prompting over the last two decades to both fundamental and clinical trials investigations into its targeted use to improve outcomes, particularly in the intensive care setting. As a crucial component of the bodys energy metabolism, lactate serves not only as a substrate for energy production but also as a signaling molecule with diverse physiological effects such as volume-cell control or pathological effects such as its role in carcinogenesis.

In critically ill patients, modification in metabolism, including lactate production and utilization, often occurs in response to a variety of stressors, such as inflammation, sepsis, and shock, among others. Both high plasma levels of lactate and poor lactate clearance are associated with prognosis, making the reduction of blood levels of lactate a potential therapeutic objective in the management of critically ill patients. But beyond this pragmatic approach for monitoring patients, recent studies have highlighted a more nuanced role in the pathophysiology of critical illness.

This review reports the current knowledge about lactate as a potential therapeutic in intensive care, examining the underlying mechanisms, clinical evidence, and emerging strategies that harness lactate modulation to enhance the recovery of critically ill patients.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^111LuCR2]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence calls for a reappraisal of lactates role in critical care — not merely as a biomarker, but as a potential therapeutic agent. Its metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and signaling properties offer promising avenues for organ support in critically ill patients. Importantly, clinical studies using hypertonic sodium lactate have consistently reported good safety profiles, despite transient elevations in pH, plasma osmolality, or serum sodium levels. This supports the tolerability of lactate-based therapies in diverse patient populations. A paradigm shift is therefore warranted: future research should move beyond lactate clearance to explore its targeted administration as an adjunct or alternative treatment strategy. Priority must be given to large-scale randomized trials and mechanistic studies to determine optimal dosing, timing, and patient selection. Harnessing lactate's full therapeutic potential may significantly broaden the current armamentarium in intensive care medicine.

### Stepwise lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: prognostic, influencing factors, and clinical phenotype [^1164Kn3X]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

For patients with hyperlactatemia, how long should we monitor the lactate kinetics? Hernandez et al. confirmed that only 52% of septic shock patients had normal blood lactate levels within 24 h. In a study by Maryna et al. for patients with lactate kinetics less than 19%, the average lactate level for the first 24 h was 5.25 mmol/L, and the average for the second 24 h was 6.43 mmol/L. Even in patients with lactate kinetics greater than 19%, the average lactate level for the first 24 h was 5.10 mmol/L, and the average for the second 24 h was 2.47 mmol/L. Thus, even after 24 h of resuscitation, a large number of patients still have hyperlactatemia and hypoperfusion. Therefore, monitoring 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h lactate kinetics alone is not sufficient to guide the entire process of resuscitation therapy. Based on the above reasons, our retrospective analysis of previous patients determined lactate kinetics cutoff values at five time points, from 6 h to 72 h. In addition, with the passage of time, the lactate kinetics gradually increased, and the ability to predict the survival rate of patients was also more evident.

Bicarbonate therapy — recommendations in adults with septic shock: For hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia, we suggest against using sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to reduce vasopressor requirements (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), and the narrative specifies this applies to pH ≥ 7.15. For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) with acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by AKI Network (AKIN) score 2 or 3, we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^114jCT4Q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcome in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock, i.e. septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock.

From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, a decreased clearance or a combination of the two. As elevated plasma lactate forms part of the definition of shock, the argument to measure it as a diagnostic marker of shock is circular. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate level and mortality independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction in patients not only with severe sepsis, but also those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with a decreased mortality rate. Two studies proposed 'lactate-based management' of ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock, who were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and MAP; additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize ScvO₂ did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. showed, in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, that lactate-guided therapy (with the aim of decreasing lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 h for the initial 8 h) in comparison with no lactate-guided therapy (in which the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels other than the admission level) reduced hospital mortality when predefined risk factors were adjusted (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). These authors demonstrated a reduced rate of organ failure — but no reduced mortality — in the lactate group compared with the control group in the early observation period (between 9 and 72 h). Lactate levels between the control and lactate groups were similar over a 3-day period. In clinical practice, we suggest serial measurements of lactates and/or base deficit to evaluate not only the outcome and prognosis but also to guide therapy; lactate measurements can be performed every 2 h in the first 8 h and every 8–12 h thereafter.

### A peptide-based medical device for the selective removal of inflammatory factors from the blood of people with sepsis [^113i7p7o]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Third International Consensus (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as "organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection", for the first time underlining the crucial role of the innate and adaptive immune responses in the development of the clinical syndrome. The Global Burden of Disease studies for the period 1990–2017 estimated 48.9 million cases in 2017 with 11 million deaths, while emphasizing an overall decrease in incidence (37% decrease) and mortality (52.8% decrease) compared to 1990. However, the situation remains of particular concern.

After the initial episode of sepsis, an increased risk of mortality persists for more than 2 years after hospital admission, and may be associated with secondary infections and vascular changes. In patients with sepsis, an inflammatory response loses its localized nature and becomes systemic with further errors in regulation, and as it progresses, it is characterized by fever, increased respiratory rate and other metabolic, hormonal and coagulative alterations, eventually leading to extremely low blood pressure. These are due to upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways that lead to system-wide release of cytokines, mediators and pathogen-related molecules, resulting in activation of coagulation and complement cascades.

Early diagnosis of sepsis is crucial for a better and faster clinical outcome. Lactic acid, procalcitonin (PCT) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score are useful biomarkers to assess the severity of sepsis, predict septic shock and reach an early diagnosis –. Many studies have reported elderly subjects with elevated SOFA scores and lactic acid concentrations among deceased patients.

Today, standard therapy for sepsis consists mainly of attempting to eliminate the focus and timely administration of empirically targeted antibiotics (causal therapy). Additional intensive care measures are also used for individual organ support, like vasopressor administration, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy (supportive therapy). Although outcomes are improving, there is no approved pharmacological treatment specific to sepsis, although it is widely accepted that early intervention is crucial for success. Live bacteria and bacterial endotoxins are simultaneously in circulation in sepsis patients –. Since bacterial infections are the major triggers of the onset of sepsis, prompt antibiotic therapy is reported to be the only effective therapeutic procedure. However, misuse of antibiotics can cause dead bacteria to release excess bacterial toxins, thus furthering progression. The lack of specific treatments has promoted research mainly focused on attenuating the hyper-inflammatory state and microcirculatory disturbances associated with sepsis.

### Treatment of lactic acidosis: appropriate confusion [^112hz3TN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis (LA) is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. There have been major recent advances in our understanding of lactate generation and physiology. However, treatment of LA is an area of controversy and uncertainty, and the use of agents to raise pH is not clearly beneficial.

Aim and Methods

We reviewed animal and human studies on the pathogenesis, impact, and treatment of LA, published in the English language and available through the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Our aim was to clarify the physiology of the generation of LA, its impact on outcomes, and the different treatment modalities available. We also examined relevant data regarding LA induced by medications commonly prescribed by hospitalists: biguanides, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), linezolid, and lorazepam.

Results/Conclusions

Lactic acid is a marker of tissue ischemia but it also may accumulate without tissue hypoperfusion. In the latter circumstance, lactic acid accumulation may be an adaptive mechanism-a novel possibility quite in contrast to the traditional view of lactic acid as only a marker of tissue ischemia. Studies on the treatment of LA with sodium bicarbonate or other buffers fail to show consistent clinical benefit. Severe acidemia in the setting of LA is a particularly poorly studied area. In the settings of medication-induced LA, optimal treatment, apart from prompt cessation of the offending agent, is still unclear.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### How to interpret lactate [^115fGPHf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The association between hyperlactataemia and poorer outcomes in acutely unwell adults and children is well recognised. Blood lactate testing has become readily available in acute settings and is considered a first-line investigation in international guidelines for the management of sepsis. However, while healthcare professionals do appreciate the value of measuring blood lactate in acute severe illness, its clinical significance and interpretation remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the evidence for the use of lactate as a diagnostic test and prognostic marker in acutely unwell children.

Background

Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis is an unusual presentation. It could be diagnosed in patients who require the large amount of β2-adrenergic agonist in short period as status asthmaticus treatment. Although this salbutamol inhaler is a common drug rescuing airway obstructive problem, there has unexpectedly serious adverse effect — lactic acidosis when it is excessively applied. However, there have no definite diagnostic criteria, exclusion of other potential etiologies is essentially required. The pathophysiology of salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis is an increase of glycolysis pathway resulting in pyruvate and lactate escalation.

### The role of lactate clearance in the resuscitation bundle [^1169W9Y1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The sepsis resuscitation bundle is the result of an effort on behalf of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to translate individual guideline recommendations into standardized, achievable goals for physicians caring for the critically ill patient. Implementation of this bundle is associated with decreased mortality. Many of the bundle items reflect components of therapy shown to improve mortality in the seminal early goal-directed therapy trial for severe sepsis and septic shock, including an initial lactate measurement. Elevations in serum lactate are associated with increased mortality, and may result from either increased lactate production or impaired lactate clearance. Lactate clearance may be an important addition to the monitoring and management bundles of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, However, specific mechanisms of lactate clearance, the relation of lactate clearance to traditional hemodynamic parameters, and the importance of lactate clearance as a therapeutic target or monitoring tool remain unclear.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^1152sZf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^111suThw]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since the early studies by Weil and others, blood lactate concentrations have been used widely as a marker of altered tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. In physiological conditions, about 1500 mmol of lactate is produced daily from various organs, including the muscle, the intestine, the red blood cells, the brain, and the skin. Lactate is metabolized by the liver (about 60%), the kidneys (about 30%), and other organs. The normal blood lactate concentration is around 1 mEq/l. Even minor increases in lactate concentrations to > 1.5 mEq/l are associated with higher mortality rates. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of hyperlactatemia have been much debated, because the condition does not always simply reflect the development of anaerobic metabolism. In sepsis in particular, metabolic alterations can contribute to elevated blood lactate concentrations, including increased glycolysis, catecholamine-stimulated Na–K pump activity, alterations in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and reduced lactate clearance primarily as a result of liver hypoperfusion. Regardless of these mechanisms, hyperlactatemia is a hallmark characteristic of shock states and the degree of increase in lactate concentrations is directly related to the severity of the shock state and to mortality rates.

### Metformin-induced lactic acidosis: no one left behind [^114JtgXm]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Metformin is a safe drug when correctly used in properly selected patients. In real life, however, associated lactic acidosis has been repeatedly, although rarely, reported. The term metformin-induced lactic acidosis refers to cases that cannot be explained by any major risk factor other than drug accumulation, usually due to renal failure. Treatment consists of vital function support and drug removal, mainly achieved by renal replacement therapy. Despite dramatic clinical presentation, the prognosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis is usually surprisingly good.

### Lactate clearance is a useful biomarker for the prediction of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis* [^117HQegd]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Lactate clearance has been widely investigated for its prognostic value in critically ill patients. However, the results are conflicting. The present study aimed to explore the diagnostic accuracy of lactate clearance in predicting mortality in critically or acutely ill patients.

Data Sources

Databases of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge were searched from inception to June 2013.

Study Selection

Studies investigating the prognostic value of lactate clearance were defined as eligible. The searched item consisted of terms related to critically ill patients and terms related to lactate clearance.

Data Extraction

The following data were extracted: the name of the first author, publication year, subjects and setting, mean age of study population, sample size, male percentage, mortality of study cohort, definition of clearance, and the initial lactate level. Relative risk was reported to estimate the predictive value of lactate clearance on mortality rate, with relative risk less than 1 indicating that lactate clearance was a protective factor. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy of lactate clearance in predicting mortality was performed by using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model.

Data Synthesis

A total of 15 original articles were included in the study. Because of the significant heterogeneity across studies (I = 61.4%), random-effects model was used to pool relative risks. The pooled relative risk for mortality was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29–0.50). The overall sensitivity and specificity for lactate clearance to predict mortality were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61–0.80), respectively. The diagnostic performance improved slightly when meta-analysis was restricted to ICU patients, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.67–0.92) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59–0.75), respectively.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that lactate clearance is predictive of lower mortality rate in critically ill patients, and its diagnostic performance is optimal for clinical utility.

### Late-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and the role of serial imaging [^113unMAc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Mitochondria are essential for human metabolic function. Over 350 genetic mutations are associated with mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited in a matrilineal fashion. In mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), defective mitochondrial function and resultant impaired cellular energy production compromise vascular perfusion in affected tissues. Early diagnostic criteria suggested the diagnosis should be considered in those under 40. However, a broader range of phenotypes are now recognised, including those that present for the first time later in life. The primary presenting feature in MELAS is a stroke-like episode invariably resulting in patients undergoing neuroradiological imaging. We present a case of a woman with a first presentation of a stroke-like episode and seizures in her 40s who was eventually diagnosed with MELAS. We detail her clinical presentation, treatment and diagnosis, emphasising the role of serial imaging in her diagnosis.

Conclusion

Based on prospectively collected serum LDH, our study demonstrated an inverse association between LDH and survival following cancer diagnosis, adding to the current evidence on the role of LDH in cancer progression. Future mechanistic studies are therefore necessary to establish whether serum LDH is a proxy of tumour growth and severity, which explains its association to cancer survival, or whether it is also involved in early carcinogenesis.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^11279Dub]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

While a more precise categorization paradigm may provide useful guidance to clinicians when dealing with suspected cases of MALA, the authors suggest that metformin does not play a contributing role in cases in which any other condition could be attributed to the LA event, and conclude that MULA " is probably by far the most common". The authors do not provide new data to justify such a conclusion, and this conclusion does not incorporate the additive and perhaps synergistic effect metformin concentration has on inducing LA when a secondary event occurs. Contrary to the authors' assessment, MALA represents the majority of cases as there is often insufficient information in real‐world clinical settings to definitively exclude metformin as a contributing cause of LA.

The underlying assumption made by Lalau et al. is that a single low measurement of plasma metformin and the presence of any other hypoxic condition is sufficient to rule out metformin relatedness. We do not believe that metformin's involvement in the development of LA can be so easily excluded for two reasons. Firstly, metformin increases the risk of LA. Because of its ability to disrupt lactate metabolism, metformin accumulation can cause LA on its own in extreme cases (eg, renal failure, overdose), and moderate accumulation can increase the likelihood that a secondary hypoxic event would lead to LA even though the severity of such an event may not have been sufficient to lead to LA in the absence of metformin accumulation. Thus, metformin use presents a risk of metformin plasma accumulation, which lowers the threshold for any relevant other intercurrent event to induce LA. As such, a secondary condition/event is often present in cases of MALA, but that is an insufficient reason to exclude metformin accumulation as a contributing factor. The relationship between degree of metformin accumulation and severity of a secondary hypoxic condition as it relates to LA risk is complex, as exemplified in Figure 1.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

Lactic acid production has been regarded as a mechanism by which malignant cells escape immunosurveillance. Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry and the use of cell culture media with a physiological nutrient composition have shed new light on the role of lactic acid and its conjugate lactate in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we review novel work identifying lactate as a physiological carbon source for mammalian tumors and immune cells. We highlight evidence that its use as a substrate is distinct from the immunosuppressive acidification of the extracellular milieu by lactic acid protons. Together, data suggest that neutralizing the effects of intratumoral acidity while maintaining physiological lactate metabolism in cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells should be pursued to boost anti-tumor immunity.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^11136oJx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate levels: production versus clearance

In clinical practice the change in lactate levels over time is thought to primarily reflect a change in production. As increased levels are generally associated with circulatory dysfunction, we often see a decrease in lactate levels as associated with an improvement in circulatory status and hypothesize (but cannot prove) decreased production. However, as true clearance in both stable septic patients and septic shock animals is significantly decreased in shock states, ongoing hyperlactatemia or even a rise in lactate levels may reflect decreased clearance rather than an increase in production of lactate. This is typically seen in the presence of shock with associated ischemic hepatitis. In addition, the complex inter- and intracellular metabolism of lactate makes our understanding of lactate physiology in shock extremely limited (see Sect. " Lactate as a substrate ").

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^112cdM3e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why has the tissue hypoxia paradigm emerged and dominated until now?

The clinical syndrome of lactic acidosis was popularized by Huckabee and Weil over five decades ago. These authors proposed that elevated blood lactate levels during experimental and clinical shock states served as a measure of the degree of oxygen deficit and the severity of injury. It became widely believed that, in critically ill patients, when oxygen delivery failed to meet oxygen demand an oxygen debt with global tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis would ensue. Furthermore, classic teaching describes type A lactic acidosis, which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery with the presence of anaerobic glycolysis, and type B lactic acidosis, which occurs in the absence of anaerobic glycolysis and is secondary to altered clearance, malignancy, or drugs. It is widely assumed that type A lactic acidosis is the cause of an elevated lactate concentration in the critically ill patient with an overt or occult hemodynamic disturbance. An increased blood lactate concentration is therefore regarded as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia. It follows from this reasoning that patients with an elevated blood lactate level should be treated by increasing oxygen delivery.

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^113kkZht]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO₃ increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO₃ is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na₂CO₃ and NaHCO₃ that buffers similarly to NaHCO₃ but without net generation of CO₂. The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### Treatment options for lactic acidosis and metabolic crisis in children with mitochondrial disease [^116Hw93a]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation route is a tightly regulated process, which is essential for aerobic cellular energy production. Disruption of this pathway may lead to severe neurometabolic disorders with onset in early childhood. A frequent finding in these patients is acute and chronic lactic acidemia, which is caused by increased conversion of pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Under stable clinical conditions, this process may remain well compensated and does not require specific therapy. However, especially in situations with altered energy demands, such as febrile infections or longer periods of fasting, children with mitochondrial disorders have a high risk of metabolic decompensation with exacerbation of hyperlactatemia and severe metabolic acidosis. Unfortunately, no controlled studies regarding therapy of this critical condition are available and clinical outcome is often unfavorable. Therefore, the aim of this review was to formulate expert-based suggestions for treatment of these patients, including dietary recommendations, buffering strategies and specific drug therapy. However, it is important to keep in mind that a specific therapy for the underlying metabolic cause in children with mitochondrial diseases is usually not available and symptomatic therapy especially of severe lactic acidosis has its ethical limitations.

### Utility of lactate levels in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic shock [^115pA8pd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Early recognition of septic shock and its treatment are key factors for limiting progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Lactate, a byproduct of metabolic pathways, is usually elevated in tissue hypoperfusion and shock and is associated with poor prognosis in sepsis. As a biomarker, it may help the clinician in risk stratification, and the identification and treatment of sepsis. In this article, we provide an update on lactate's pathophysiology and role in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children with sepsis and septic shock.

### Lactic acid: a corrosive poison… [^111aQ74A]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The common occurrence and physiologic role of lactic acid have tended to establish the general opinion that this substance is not to be considered as poisonous. Lactic acid is not mentioned in any of the standard textbooks on toxicology. We have been able to find only one reference to it as a cause of death in a human being. Leschke1 cites a case described by Fühner2 of a woman aged 27 who died in twelve hours after the administration by duodenal tube of 100 cc. of a 33 per cent aqueous solution of lactic acid in error for magnesium sulfate. This resulted in dyspnea, vomiting of blood and mucus, a rapid feeble pulse, hemoglobinuria and cyanosis. The autopsy revealed a dark red patch of erosion in the duodenum. Both duodenum and jejunum showed hemorrhagic infiltration of all coats and necrosing inflammation. Leschke remarks that "lactic acid has a YOUNG EG, SMITH RP.

### A lactatic perspective on metabolism [^116k9zdn]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

The cell-to-cell lactate shuttle was introduced in 1984 and has been repeatedly supported by studies using a variety of experimental approaches. Because of its large mass and metabolic capacity, skeletal muscle is probably the major component of the lactate shuttle in terms of both production and consumption. Muscles exercising in a steady state are avid consumers of lactate, using most of the lactate as an oxidative fuel. Cardiac muscle is highly oxidative and readily uses lactate as a fuel. Lactate is a major gluconeogenic substrate for the liver; the use of lactate to form glucose increases when blood lactate concentration is elevated. Illustrative of the widespread shuttling of lactate, even the brain takes up lactate when the blood level is increased. Recently, an intracellular lactate shuttle has also been proposed. Although disagreements abound, current evidence suggests that lactate is the primary end-product of glycolysis at cellular sites remote from mitochondria. This lactate could subsequently diffuse to areas adjacent to mitochondria. Evidence is against lactate oxidation within the mitochondrial matrix, but a viable hypothesis is that lactate could be converted to pyruvate by a lactate oxidation complex with lactate dehydrogenase located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In another controversial area, the role of lactic acid in acid-base balance has been hotly debated in recent times. Careful analysis reveals that lactate, not lactic acid, is the substrate/product of metabolic reactions. One view is that lactate formation alleviates acidosis, whereas another is that lactate is a causative factor in acidosis. Surprisingly, there is little direct mechanistic evidence regarding cause and effect in acid-base balance. However, there is insufficient evidence to discard the term "lactic acidosis".

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^113bMrZm]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a very common biological issue for shock patients. Experimental data clearly demonstrate that metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, participates in the reduction of cardiac contractility and in the vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors through various mechanisms. However, the contributions of each mechanism responsible for these deleterious effects have not been fully determined and their respective consequences on organ failure are still poorly defined, particularly in humans. Despite some convincing experimental data, no clinical trial has established the level at which pH becomes deleterious for hemodynamics. Consequently, the essential treatment for lactic acidosis in shock patients is to correct the cause. It is unknown, however, whether symptomatic pH correction is beneficial in shock patients. The latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend against the use of buffer therapy with pH ≥ 7.15 and issue no recommendation for pH levels < 7.15. Furthermore, based on strong experimental and clinical evidence, sodium bicarbonate infusion alone is not recommended for restoring pH. Indeed, bicarbonate induces carbon dioxide generation and hypocalcemia, both cardiovascular depressant factors. This review addresses the principal hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis. Despite the lack of formal evidence, this review also highlights the various adapted supportive therapy options that could be putatively added to causal treatment in attempting to reverse the hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^113mK7Kv]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in different groups of critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, with or without organ failure, trauma, and acute inflammatory response syndrome. It has been also used to guide management of critically ill patients. For example, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and early goal-directed therapy recommend resuscitation of sepsis patients with lactate > 4 m M. In clinical practice, less attention is paid to lactate levels within the reference range (≤ 2 m M), as their clinical significance is not well understood. Studies have suggested that relative hyperlactatemia in patients with septic shock has been associated with mortality, indicating that lactate might remain normal before and during resuscitation, thus questioning what is the best cutoff threshold of lactate that should trigger resuscitation. However, data in this area remain limited. Therefore, we sought to determine the best cutoff threshold for serum lactate that is within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M) that best discriminates between survivors and nonsurvivors of critical illness and to examine the association between relative hyperlactatemia (lactate above the identified threshold) and mortality.

### Diabetes, metformin and lactic acidosis [^116aVHdk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin has long been thought to cause lactic acidosis (LA) but evidence from various sources has led researchers to question a direct causative relationship. We assessed the relationship of metformin prescription and other factors to the incidence of LA.

Methods

All cases of LA at a single hospital were identified from laboratory lactate measurements. We compared patients classified as Cohen and Woods class A and B, patients with and without diabetes, and those taking metformin or not.

Results

LA was more common than in published analyses based on hospital coding of diagnoses. The incidence of LA was greater in diabetes than in the nondiabetic population but with no further increase in patients taking metformin. Lactate levels were no greater in patients on metformin than in patients with type 2 diabetes not on metformin even if patients with acute cardiorespiratory disturbance (Cohen and Woods class A) were excluded. Acidosis was greater in diabetes (hydrogen ion 94.9 ± 4.6 vs 83.2 ± 2.3 10⁻⁹ m, P = 0.027) but factors besides lactate contributed. Acute cardiorespiratory illness, acute renal impairment and sepsis were the most common of the recognized precipitating factors. Age (P = 0.01), acute renal failure (P = 0.015) and sepsis (P = 0.005) were associated with mortality.

Conclusions

Diabetes rather than metformin therapy is the major risk factor for the development of LA. Lactic acidosis occurs in association with acute illness particularly in diabetes. Current guidance for the prevention of lactic acidosis may overemphasize the role of metformin.

### SCAI door to lactate clearance (SCAI DLC) cardiogenic shock initiative: definition, hypothesis, and call to action [^114py82J]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI Door to Lactate Clearance (DLC) in cardiogenic shock — definition and practical use emphasize serial lactate assessment. The DLC is defined as a fall in lactate to < 2 mmol/L within the first 24 hours of diagnosis. Point-of-care lactic acid measurements have long been available via commercial devices with capillary blood samples but are not routinely utilized, and the value of lactic acid depends on the sample site and analyzer; differences between venous, arterial, and capillary sampling are of little clinical significance, and repeated measurements using the same location allow trend assessment. DLC is equally accessible to both regional referral centers (RRCs) as well as tertiary advanced centers (TACs), and the RRC without the capability to escalate care to advanced levels needs to be particularly cognizant of the failure of LC as an indication to rapidly re-evaluate the patient, escalate care or consider transfer to TACs. After initial staging with the SCAI SHOCK classification, we propose that the baseline be measured at initial diagnosis and then subsequently every 2 to 3 hours to evaluate the clinical response to the initial management strategy.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^112Ld1ix]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.

### SCAI door to lactate clearance (SCAI DLC) cardiogenic shock initiative: definition, hypothesis, and call to action [^1114zMju]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of lactate in cardiogenic shock (CS) — production, clearance, and classification: Lactic acid is produced at low levels by multiple tissues and increases with hypoxemia or tissue hypoperfusion; under hypoxia, glycolysis generates pyruvate that is reduced by L‑lactate dehydrogenase to lactate, and adrenergic stress can accelerate glycolysis. Lactate clearance (LC) occurs primarily through the liver — accounting for approximately 70% to 75% — with the remaining 25% to 30% cleared by the kidneys and urinary excretion playing only a minor role in clearance (< 10%). The historic classification of lactic acidosis divides the condition into 2 categories: type A (inadequate tissue perfusion or oxygenation resulting in excess lactate production) and type B (adequate perfusion with increased production, reduced clearance, or both).

In physiological and aerobic conditions, cells continuously generate lactate through the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, by cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (cLDH) (Fig. 2 A). Production of lactate is therefore essential for the continuous oxidation of glucose, because it allows the regeneration of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) from its oxidized form NADH, thereby sustaining glycolytic flux. This argues for the importance of lactate generation in normal cell functioning. At rest, the production of lactate is approximately 0.8 mmol/kg/hr for an adult and increases rapidly during exercise. During exercise, the energy required for cellular function is supplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules through the utilization of glucose or glycogen in glycolysis or glycogenolysis. Consequently, during these glycolytic activities, one glucose molecule produces 2 ATP molecules and 2 pyruvate molecules. The pyruvate, in turn, can be oxidized to generate more ATP molecules in the mitochondria. This highlights the central role of lactate as linking oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in organisms, allowing the optimization of glucose utilization. During sustained exercise, excess pyruvate is generated through glycolysis and is partially reduced by lactate dehydrogenase to form lactate, regenerating NAD⁺ required for continued glycolytic flux (Fig. 2 A). At equilibrium, the lactate/pyruvate ratio is 10 to 1. When energy expenditure reaches the maximal capacities of mitochondria to oxidize glucose, pyruvate accumulates and lactate production rises. This limits is historically names the anaerobic threshold, and varies among individuals.

Schematic showing some of the possible evolutions of blood lactate levels over time: decreasing (1), remaining stable (2), or increasing (3). Dashed lines represent an unfavorable course and suggest the need for treatment to be reviewed, if this has not already been done, because the current management is likely ineffective

We performed a literature search on this subject to address several questions. First, is the observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations a consistent finding in all types of critically ill patient? Second, although some studies have suggested that repeated lactate measurements may be particularly useful in sepsis, can similar observations be made in other acute disease states or even in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients? Third, how fast should lactate concentrations decrease in optimal conditions and is there any particular time interval that could be recommended? Fourth, some studies in emergency medicine considered only patients with lactate values > 4 mEq/l as an at-risk population, but is this approach valid? In other words, is the study of lactate kinetics more useful when lactate concentrations exceed a given value?

### Therapeutic potential of pyruvate therapy for patients with mitochondrial diseases: a systematic review [^114i5jzd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, remarkable progress has been reported with regard to the mechanism and classification of mitochondrial disease, although no authoritative treatment has been recommended worldwide. Most studies have reported symptomatic and supportive treatment, including medication, diet therapy, and exercise therapy. In the field of medication, several drugs have been reported to enhance the function of mitochondria: antioxidants (coenzyme Q10 and vitamin C), respiratory chain auxiliary factors (nicotine, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10), improvement of muscle lactic acid poisoning (dichloroacetate), and supplementation of deficient substances (creatine, levocarnitine). However, the effectiveness of these drugs has not been determined. The Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of the Mitochondrial Medicine Society states that case reports, a limited number of case series, and small open-labeled studies are the main supporting evidence for the treatment of mitochondrial disease. In addition, dichloroacetate was reported to cause toxic neuropathy in MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) in a randomized controlled trial, although it was effective for lactic acidosis. Therefore, medical treatments for mitochondrial disease are in urgent need of new discovery.

As an endogenous substance, pyruvate plays a crucial role in the metabolism of three principal substances, and is located at a metabolic branch point between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation. It is well known that pyruvate is synthesized mainly as the end product of glycolysis in the cytoplasm under normal physiological circumstances. In addition, pyruvate is also generated by amino acids (such as alanine, cysteine, serine, and glycine), malate, and lactate. In the cytoplasm, pyruvate can either be consumed as an amine receptor for alanine transaminase (ALT), metabolized to lactate and NAD+ by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to produce a few ATP for cells under hypoxic conditions, and excreted from the cell via the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT). Pyruvate can also enter into the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and be converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Subsequently, acetyl-CoA can combine with oxaloacetate to form citrate and begin the TCA cycle to yield ATP, NADH, and FADH₂, and the latter two molecules can transfer their energy to the electron transport chain. Alternatively, pyruvate may be transformed into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) in the mitochondria, which is an essential step in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, pyruvate play a central role in cellular homeostasis (Figure 1).

### Dynamic lactate indices as predictors of outcome in critically ill patients [^112avx7N]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, higher LAC TW24 and LAC Δ24 blood lactate concentrations are associated with greater hospital mortality. In the first 24 hours following ICU admission, they have significant independent predictive value, improve the performance of illness severity score-based outcome predictions and are superior to simple static measures of lactate concentration. Future studies should be conducted to determine the clinical utility of the composite measure of lactate derangement (magnitude, duration and rate of correction) to predict mortality and to determine potential the utility of LAC Δ24 as a future therapeutic target/trigger. While these dynamic measures do not have a routine role in daily clinical practice, clinicians should be especially alert to all patients with a persistently deranged or rapidly rising blood lactate concentration.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^11173gbC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a goal of what?

The complexity of lactate as a molecule, substrate, biomarker, energy source, component of some intravenous fluids, and major modulator of cellular bioenergetics during physiological stress is formidable. Such complexity makes it impossible to define what goal it should be a marker or target of. Seeking to lower lactate levels (by whatever means given the multiple events that regulate its blood levels) has no credibility and no logic in terms of hemodynamics, bioenergetics, or tissue protection. In fact, it could make more biological sense to assist the natural process of lactate utilization and generation during sepsis or during other physiological stress situations by administering lactate. Until we are able to define the goals that we wish to achieve by manipulating lactate and have the means of measuring whether we have achieved such goals or not, the idea of seeking to lower lactate by increasing its "clearance" in sepsis is both an illusion and a folly.

### The science and translation of lactate shuttle theory [^112i4Pxz]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. "Lactate shuttle" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a "strain" and not a "stress" biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review.

### Lactic acidemia and mitochondrial disease [^112Lw7DC]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Lactic acidemia is present in the majority of patients with mitochondrial oxidative defects as well as in disorders of gluconeogenesis. An understanding of the dynamics of lactic acid metabolism in the human body and the influences on lactate/pyruvate ratios exerted by changes in cellular redox state allows for the development of diagnostic algorithms based on clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Mitochondrial disorders can be due to defects in nuclear genes directly affecting the respiratory chain assembly or function, mtDNA genes affecting the respiratory chain or nuclear genes influencing mtDNA structure and viability. In this review, we look at the classification of mitochondrial disease from the perspective of not just the genetic and biochemical etiology but also from the perspective of the clinical phenotypic expression.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^116ykNbf]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactate, traditionally viewed as a biomarker of hypoxia and severity in critical illness, has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic agent. Its roles extend beyond energy metabolism to include anti-inflammatory and signaling functions. This review explores the evolving evidence supporting lactates therapeutic application in critical care settings.

Main Body

We synthesize current knowledge on lactate physiology, including its production, transport, and metabolism across organs. Experimental models and clinical studies data suggest that exogenous lactate, particularly in the form of hypertonic sodium lactate (HSL), improves hemodynamics, reduces inflammation, and enhances organ function in sepsis, acute heart failure, and brain injury. Lactate administration shows promise in restoring metabolic homeostasis, improving microcirculation, and supporting cardiac and cerebral recovery. However, clinical studies in critical care remain limited, largely because lactate is predominantly regarded as a marker of poor prognosis rather than as a potential energy substrate with therapeutic value.

Conclusion

Lactate-based therapy represents a paradigm shift in the management of critical illness. While preclinical data are promising, larger, well-designed randomized trials are needed to establish its safety, efficacy, and optimal indications. The therapeutic repositioning of lactate could complement or replace current resuscitation fluids and metabolic modulators in intensive care unit (ICU).

### Cardiovascular effects of hypertonic lactate solutions: acid-base or metabolic cause, or both? [^1173L1Yg]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

It was a pleasure to read the recent publication in Critical Care on the cardiovascular effects of lactate. The authors conducted a randomized comparison between the infusion of hypertonic lactated solution and hypertonic saline solution and their effects on echocardiography measurements. The authors equalized the osmolarity of the solutions to ensure that there were no differences in volume expansion between groups — as evidenced by the preload metrics. The authors assert that the observed hemodynamic differences were primarily attributable to the infusion of hypertonic lactate i.e. lactate anion.

Increasing evidence supports lactate as a valuable metabolic intermediate and signaling molecule, highlighting its potential future therapeutic role. However, before concluding on the positive effects of exogenous hypertonic lactate solutions, we would like to discuss additional acid–base and metabolic considerations that will contribute in moving the discourse and future investigations forward.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^115G8oLL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### Acid-base disorders in liver disease [^113ETRKi]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Alongside the kidneys and lungs, the liver has been recognised as an important regulator of acid-base homeostasis. While respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder in chronic liver disease, various complex metabolic acid-base disorders may occur with liver dysfunction. While the standard variables of acid-base equilibrium, such as pH and overall base excess, often fail to unmask the underlying cause of acid-base disorders, the physical-chemical acid-base model provides a more in-depth pathophysiological assessment for clinical judgement of acid-base disorders, in patients with liver diseases. Patients with stable chronic liver disease have several offsetting acidifying and alkalinising metabolic acid-base disorders. Hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis is counteracted by hyperchloraemic and dilutional acidosis, resulting in a normal overall base excess. When patients with liver cirrhosis become critically ill (e.g., because of sepsis or bleeding), this fragile equilibrium often tilts towards metabolic acidosis, which is attributed to lactic acidosis and acidosis due to a rise in unmeasured anions. Interestingly, even though patients with acute liver failure show significantly elevated lactate levels, often, no overt acid-base disorder can be found because of the offsetting hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis. In conclusion, patients with liver diseases may have multiple co-existing metabolic acid-base abnormalities. Thus, knowledge of the pathophysiological and diagnostic concepts of acid-base disturbances in patients with liver disease is critical for therapeutic decision making.

We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented shortly after the diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer with profound lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Her acid-base disturbance was unresponsive to medical management but resolved after initiation of systemic chemotherapy. In addition to malignancy associated lactic acidosis, this case illustrates several other issues, including factors involved in choosing the initial chemotherapy regimen and sequencing subsequent therapies, and the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in following response to treatment. It is important to report this case of a rare but serious complication of malignancy in order to increase recognition and understanding of this presentation.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^114C26LV]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and outcome of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is one of the most common biological concerns for intensivists. Nevertheless, clinical studies assessing the incidence and outcome of lactic acidosis are sparse and are mostly retrospective or prospective in nature with small sample sizes.

For this review, the most convincing prospective multi-center study, conducted in 2011 by Jung and colleagues, noted severe lactic acidosis in 6% of the studied population (200/2,550 patients); that is, with pH 7.09 ± 0.11 with high lactatemia values. Eighty-three percent of these patients were treated with vasopressors with a mortality rate of 57%. In this study, lactatemia and the swiftness of lactic acidosis correction were linked with survival. Interestingly, only 18% exhibited a slight coexistent respiratory acidosis at admission.

Clearly, a causal relationship between lactic acidosis and mortality has yet to be established. For example, in metformin-associated lactic acidosis, even with pH values most often around 7.0, the observed mortality rate was 25%. However, for the same pH values during shock, regardless of origin, no survival was reported. Consequently, severe lactic acidosis is much more of a precipitator than a direct causal factor of mortality. Lactic acidosis probably contributes to the decompensation of underlying comorbidities and, hence, to the mortality rate.

### Lactic acidosis: current treatments and future directions [^115VXQdL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mortality rates associated with severe lactic acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) due to sepsis or low-flow states are high. Eliminating the triggering conditions remains the most effective therapy. Although recommended by some, administration of sodium bicarbonate does not improve cardiovascular function or reduce mortality. This failure has been attributed to both reduction in serum calcium concentration and generation of excess carbon dioxide with intracellular acidification. In animal studies, hyperventilation and infusion of calcium during sodium bicarbonate administration improves cardiovascular function, suggesting that this approach could allow expression of the positive aspects of sodium bicarbonate. Other buffers, such as THAM or Carbicarb, or dialysis might also provide base with fewer untoward effects. Examination of these therapies in humans is warranted. The cellular injury associated with lactic acidosis is partly due to activation of NHE1, a cell-membrane Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger. In animal studies, selective NHE1 inhibitors improve cardiovascular function, ameliorate lactic acidosis, and reduce mortality, supporting future research into their possible use in humans. Two main mechanisms contribute to lactic acid accumulation in sepsis and low-flow states: tissue hypoxia and epinephrine-induced stimulation of aerobic glycolysis. Targeting these mechanisms could allow for more specific therapy. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case presents a patient with acute lactic acidosis and describes current and future approaches to treatment.

### Cancer-generated lactic acid: a regulatory, immunosuppressive metabolite? [^112W28rw]. The Journal of Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Lactic acid, commonly generated by cancers via reprogrammed energy metabolism (ie aerobic glycolysis, increased glutaminolysis), has a critical role in their growth as an immunosuppressive metabolite as well as a promoter of angiogenesis. Targeting altered, lactic acid-producing metabolisms of cancers may therefore lead to inhibition of their growth not only via energy/nutrition deprivation, but also through reduction of their immunosuppressive activity in the tumour micro-environment. This strategy, which simultaneously targets two fundamental cancer characteristics (ie altered energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction), could be effective for the therapy of a broad range of cancers and could be particularly useful in combination with cancer immunotherapy.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^114jA46a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Potential role of NHE1 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1) in the cellular dysfunction of lactic acidosis: implications for treatment [^113rSEkj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The development of lactic acidosis in seriously ill patients often is accompanied by impairment in organ function and increased morbidity and mortality. Although hypoxia per se is a crucial factor, detrimental effects also have been attributed to the metabolic acidosis that accompanies lactic acidosis. As a result, ancillary treatment of lactic acidosis has included base administration to improve the metabolic acidosis. However, treatment with base does not necessarily result in improved cellular function or clinical outcome. Recent research suggests that lactic acidosis can be associated with activation of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), potentially giving rise to deleterious increases in cellular sodium and calcium ion concentrations, which can cause cardiac stunning and arrhythmias, extend cerebral damage, and worsen kidney function. Also, experimental studies in animals suggest that selective inhibition of this transporter might decrease the severity of cellular injury in the heart, brain, and kidney. These findings suggest that administration of selective inhibitors of NHE1 to patients with severe lactic acidosis might be beneficial. This article reviews experimental evidence of the role of NHE1 in the pathogenesis of cellular dysfunction with lactic acidosis and potential benefits of treatment with selective inhibitors of this transporter.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^111erx6T]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Although rapidly becoming the first-line diagnostic test of choice for suspected mitochondrial disorders, WES results in a high-probability gene assignment in < 1/3 of individuals tested. This is in accord with the general WES-associated molecular diagnostic rate of 20–30% for other unsolved Mendelian disorders. Potential reasons for the modest molecular diagnostic rate are manifold. At present, we are aware of only 6000 human disease genes, and we suspect that there are many more with estimates of 6000–13,000 disease genes yet to be identified. Furthermore, the variation responsible for the transient lactic acidosis may not be detectable by "exon" level methods such as variation in the non-coding region, a chromosomal deletion or duplication, complex chromosomal rearrangement(s) or expansion mutations. Technological advances such as whole-genome sequencing and RNA-Seq may resolve some of these issues and provide answers for the family in the near future.

The transient disorder described in this report should be considered a rare exception to the poor prognosis characteristic of most primary lactic acidoses. In the absence of an accurate clinical and family history, transient primary hyperlactatemia may easily be mistaken for typical etiologies of lactic acidosis such as sepsis, congenital heart disease, and perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Although uncommon, the condition presented here should be considered when counseling parents of neonates with primary lactic acidosis regarding prognosis. This case report emphasizes how the incorporation of parents, and their family history, may be vital to providing the most comprehensive overview of the neonate's status and potential prognosis. Physicians also need to have this transient primary lactic acidosis on their differential diagnosis. While providing general supportive treatment for a primary lactic acidosis (e.g. vitamins that act as cofactors and antioxidants directed towards specific signs and symptoms), physicians can cautiously note to parents that their neonate may have a transient benign form of the clinical condition. Future genetic counselling and prenatal advice could prove useful for families as well. Genetic counselling for inborn errors of metabolism varies by etiology, with this case presenting as an apparently dominant form resulting in a 50% chance of recurrence. Limitations for this case report include the need for future research required to elucidate the causative mutation and pathophysiology.

### The diagnostic role of glycosaminoglycans in pleural effusions: a pilot study [^1167fVGH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions, being a common medical problem, have been classically divided into transudates and exudates. Differentiation is of particular importance because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, if the effusion proves to be an exudate, malignancy is suspected and a more extensive diagnostic procedure is needed. According to Light's criteria which still remain the most accurate ones, pleural fluid is an exudate if any of the following are met: (a) pleural fluid to serum ratio of total protein > 0.5, (b) pleural fluid to serum ratio of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) > 0.6, and (c) pleural fluid LDH > 3/4 the upper limit of normal serum LDH. Additional criteria-such as pleural fluid cholesterol level > 60 mg/dL or > 45 mg/d, and a serum fluid albumin gradient > 1.2 mg/dl – have been also proposed in parallel or in combination with Light to optimize sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Criteria, however, regarding the differentiation between malignant and benign exudates have not been yet established.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, straight chain polysaccharides composed of repeated disaccharide units that are mainly attached to a core protein to form proteoglycans. GAGs are subdivided into the chondroitin sulfates (chondroitin-4-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate), heparan sulfates (heparan sulfate and heparin), dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronic acid and their presence has been studied in several deceases. They are normally produced by the mesothelial cells of pleural cavity and large amounts of them, mainly hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate have already been reported in pleural effusions. Afify et al concluded that hyaluronan and its cell surface receptor CD44v6 can serve as an ancillary test to cytological examination, to distinguish between malignant and benign effusions. Welker et al studied the combined use of cytology and hyaluronic acid analysis in improving the detection of malignant mesothelioma in pleural effusions, reporting impressive results.

In this pilot study we investigated: (a) the usefulness of GAGs in the assessment of pleural effusions, and (b) whether and in what way GAGs correlate with established criteria used to indicate an exudate.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^117X3sZH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic literature review has provided the following answers to our initial questions. First, observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations is consistent throughout the literature. Second, these observations are not specific to septic patients, but apply to all common situations of hyperlactatemia and in heterogeneous patient populations. Third, the changes are relatively slow, and it is difficult to provide recommendations about the speed of decrease in lactate concentrations in the best conditions. Clearly repeating measurements every 12 hrs can generally separate those who will do well from those who are likely to die, but shorter time intervals may be helpful. On the basis of our observations, we would recommend checking blood lactate concentrations as often as every 1–2 hrs in acute conditions. Fourth, the study of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value and not only in patients with severe hyperlactatemia.

### Dysfunctional lactate metabolism in human alveolar type II cells from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung explant tissue [^116k5SBY]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common form of interstitial lung disease, characterized by progressive and extensive formation of fibrous tissue in the pulmonary parenchyma. Very few treatment options and no therapeutic agents are available that have significant impacts on disease course, ultimately leading most patients to need lung transplants. Annual medical costs for IPF in the U.S are estimated to be $2 billion. The average age at IPF diagnosis is 65 years, consistent with studies suggesting that environmental chemical exposure plays a significant role in disease initiation and/or progression; however, viral infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or genetic predisposition could play roles as well.

Fibroblasts have been the focus of IPF progression studies; however, alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC2) are gaining recognition as playing important roles in exacerbating the damage that promotes the disease. In this paradigm, injured and apoptotic AEC2s produce pro-fibrotic signals that stimulate fibroblast activation and conversion to the myofibroblast phenotype. In turn, myofibroblasts produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix molecules, disrupting epithelial-fibroblast cell–cell signaling that further damages the alveolar epithelium and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition wherein the AEC2 also acquire a fibroblast phenotype. However, the initial causes of AEC damage remain poorly understood, and the underlying mechanisms of IPF progression remain insufficiently addressed.

Notably, lactic acid is significantly elevated in IPF vs. healthy lung tissue by approximately threefold, a finding consistent with altered cellular metabolism and/or clearance of lactate. The authors of that work proposed the mechanism that increased lactate production, likely by fibroblasts, may lead to pH-dependent activation and release of TGFβ, further promoting the myofibroblast phenotype in IPF. Numerous gene-related changes found in IPF, including mTOR activation and miR200 family downregulation, are known to increase expression of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A subunit which drives lactic acid production, and LDHA activity has been proposed as a target for IPF therapy. Taken together, these studies led us to directly examine AEC2 from IPF patient lungs to determine if these cells also contribute to the increased production of lactic acid associated with IPF.

### Lactate as a marker of energy failure in critically ill patients: hypothesis [^115R91tp]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state.

### Metformin, sulfonylureas, or other antidiabetes drugs and the risk of lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia: a nested case-control analysis [^1177X1DT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Metformin plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin decreases basal glucose output by suppressing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in liver and increasing glucose disposal in muscle tissue. As the most worrisome complication, lactic acidosis (pH < 7.37 and/or plasma lactate levels > 4 mmol/l) continues to be discussed in the literature even though the absolute risk appears to be low, with incidence rates of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use ranging from 1 to 16.7 cases per 100,000 patient-years. Salpeter et al. identified all trials and cohort studies conducted between 1959 and 2002 and did not find a single case of lactic acidosis in 36,893 person-years of metformin exposure. Lalau and Race analyzed 49 cases of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use; overall mortality was not correlated with plasma lactate concentrations. Interestingly, plasma metformin concentrations were, on average, three times higher in patients who survived. All case subjects with lactic acidosis had, in addition to metformin use, acute or chronic comorbidities predisposing to lactic acidosis. These data suggest that lactic acidosis may be coincidental rather than causally associated with metformin use.

### Autosomal dominant transmission of transient neonatal lactic acidosis: a case report [^112xVA5P]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactic acid is an anaerobic metabolite that tends to accumulate whenever cellular respiration is inadequate to meet cellular energy requirements. Commonly, lactic acidosis reflects acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired tissue oxygenation ('shock'). In neonates, hyperlactatemia is commonly observed in sepsis, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and congenital heart disease. When secondary, blood lactate levels mirror the patient's clinical state, resolving with correction of the underlying disease process. Primary lactic acidosis that is inappropriate to the clinical context suggests an inborn error of cellular energy metabolism. Collectively, these primary lactic acidoses are numerous. They are genetically heterogeneous with disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or pyruvate metabolism accounting for most cases. Because the mitochondrion is complex, comprising the products of > 1000 distinct nuclear genes, genetic diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disorders is rarely found, occurring only in ~ 25–50% of cases. With few exceptions (e.g. holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, which is treatable with biotin, and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is somewhat treatable with the ketogenic diet), specific treatments are lacking, and many patients die in infancy or childhood. Here we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly-inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to transient complex IV deficiency. No previous description of such an autosomal dominant form of benign, transient complex IV appears to exist in the literature; this reiterates the increasing differential diagnosis for lactic acidosis in a neonate.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^115sGjNc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a marker of severity

The evidence that lactate is a marker of illness severity in all situations of physiological stress is overwhelming. In sepsis it is a powerful predictor of mortality. In the recent ARISE trial, data were prospectively collected on lactate levels at randomization. Approximately, one-third of patients were randomized because of isolated hyperlactatemia and compared with patients randomized because of isolated hypotension. Despite similar age and sources of infection, patients with isolated hyperlactatemia had 1.7 times the risk of 90-day mortality and were less likely to be discharged alive form ICU and hospital. This predictive value has been recognized by the SEPSIS-3 consensus definition of shock, which requires the presence of hyperlactatemia.
