## Question

Patient education regarding hydrocodonacetaminophan ten three twenty five

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about patient education for hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the medication identity and dose. Then, I should verify the indication and general prescribing principles. Next, I will review core education domains, including dosing, acetaminophen safety, side effects, addiction risk, interactions, storage/disposal, and naloxone. After that, I should consider special populations and tapering. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned counseling script and highlight evidence-based tools and documentation needs, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against authoritative sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the medication and dose. "Hydrocodonacetaminophan ten three twenty five" most plausibly refers to hydrocodone bitartrate 10 mg with acetaminophen 325 mg per tablet, which is a common combination opioid-acetaminophen product used for moderate to moderately severe pain, and the acetaminophen dose per tablet is capped at 325 mg in current formulations to mitigate hepatotoxicity risk, which I should explicitly state to avoid confusion with older 500 mg or 650 mg products [^111ietXY] [^115bZfD2].

> I need to check the indication and prescribing philosophy. This combination is indicated for short-term management of acute pain when nonopioid therapy is inadequate, and the principle is to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with many acute pain conditions requiring no more than a few days of an opioid; I should confirm that this aligns with FDA labeling and CDC guidance, which it does, and I should also note that equianalgesic comparisons show no consistent superiority of schedule II versus schedule III opioids at equianalgesic doses, reinforcing judicious selection and dose minimization [^113THkDZ] [^112dgYFH] [^113Ymc9y].

> Now, I will examine dosing and administration. Wait, let me verify the maximum daily acetaminophen limit and tablet count. Current FDA labeling advises not exceeding 4,000 mg of acetaminophen per day and provides product-specific tablet limits; for example, some hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5/325 mg products specify no more than eight tablets per day, so for 10/325 mg, the maximum would be proportionally fewer tablets to stay under the acetaminophen ceiling, and I should instruct patients to take 1 tablet every 4–6 hours as needed, not to exceed the labeled maximum, and to avoid doubling up if a dose is missed; I should also remind patients not to discontinue abruptly without a taper plan to avoid withdrawal [^113THkDZ] [^111wfSWs].

> Hold on, I should verify acetaminophen safety and "double-dipping". Patients must be warned not to exceed 4,000 mg of acetaminophen per day from all sources, including OTC cold and pain products, and to call if they exceed the recommended dose; I initially thought the FDA had lowered the maximum to 3,250 mg, but wait, that was an advisory committee proposal and is not the current labeled maximum, so I should correct that and stick to 4,000 mg as the labeled limit while still advising caution and reviewing all acetaminophen-containing products with the patient [^112Vyhag] [^113kHyvB].

> Next, I should review side effects and functional cautions. Common effects include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and lightheadedness; patients should avoid driving or operating machinery until they know how they react, and I should counsel on constipation prevention and when to seek care; I need to ensure I mention serious risks like respiratory depression, especially at initiation or dose increases, and emphasize that patients should seek urgent care for excessive sedation, slow or shallow breathing, or overdose symptoms [^116XGTRB] [^111Ecagd] [^112Vyhag].

> I will now examine addiction, abuse, and misuse. Even when taken as prescribed, hydrocodone carries risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse; I should assess patient risk factors and provide intensive counseling for those at higher risk, reinforce not sharing medication, and document informed consent; I should also discuss the REMS requirement and encourage patients to read the Medication Guide each time it is dispensed, which is a consistent theme across opioid labels and aligns with FDA REMS messaging [^111hepbB] [^115bQKnC].

> Let me consider drug interactions and special cautions. Concomitant use with benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol markedly increases the risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death, so I should advise avoidance unless supervised; CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise hydrocodone levels and increase adverse effects, while CYP3A4 inducers can precipitate withdrawal if stopped, so patients should report new medications; MAOIs are contraindicated with opioids, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^116T3Sjy] [^111b5EcP] [^112Vyhag].

> I should double-check storage and disposal guidance. Unused opioids should be stored securely, out of sight and reach of children and visitors, preferably locked; when no longer needed, dispose promptly via a drug take-back program, and if none is available, flush down the toilet if the product is on the FDA flush list; I need to ensure patients receive this counseling at prescribing and again at dispensing, given persistent gaps in disposal practices and the contribution of leftover opioids to misuse [^111Ecagd] [^113BGLsv] [^115TBBuR].

> Next, I should review naloxone. For patients with overdose risk factors such as concomitant CNS depressants, history of OUD, prior overdose, or household members at risk of accidental ingestion, I should offer naloxone, educate on recognition of overdose, and instruct to call 911 even if naloxone is given; I should confirm that this is consistent with FDA labeling and CDC guidance, which it is, and document the discussion and prescription if provided [^116T3Sjy] [^116XGTRB] [^115Z8F3C].

> Let me think about special populations and tapering. In older adults or those with renal or hepatic impairment, I should start lower and go slower due to narrower therapeutic windows; in pregnancy, prolonged use can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, so I should counsel and coordinate obstetric care; if therapy is no longer beneficial, I should taper gradually to avoid withdrawal and uncontrolled pain, aligning the plan with patient goals and follow-up [^115bZfD2] [^115bQKnC] [^111wfSWs].

> I should confirm that my counseling is evidence-aligned and practical. Literacy-appropriate, dual-modality education improves knowledge and reduces risky behaviors like driving soon after dosing, though effects vary by outcome and delivery; shared decision-making and preoperative education can reduce opioid consumption and refills in some settings, while multimodal analgesia and expectation-setting further reduce opioid needs; I should tailor content to patient preferences and health literacy, and consider tools like the Patient Opioid Education Measure to identify gaps [^116TATPd] [^111RKbaT] [^115CA11j] [^115fWQD8].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise counseling script and documentation checklist. "This is hydrocodone 10 mg with acetaminophen 325 mg for short-term pain relief; take 1 tablet every 4–6 hours as needed, do not exceed [X] tablets per day to stay under 4,000 mg of acetaminophen, avoid alcohol and other sedatives, do not drive until you know how it affects you, watch for constipation and breathing problems, store locked away and dispose of leftovers promptly, and never share; if you have risk factors or people at home who could accidentally take it, I can provide naloxone and training", with written instructions, a Medication Guide, and documentation of risks, benefits, alternatives, goals, and follow-up plans [^113THkDZ] [^112Vyhag] [^111Ecagd] [^1157AHc3].

---

Hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 mg is for **short-term use only** to treat moderate pain when nonopioids are inadequate [^113THkDZ]. Patients should take **1 tablet every 4–6 hours as needed**, not exceeding 6 tablets per day to avoid acetaminophen liver toxicity [^112Vyhag]. Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression; avoid alcohol, other CNS depressants, and driving until you know how it affects you [^116XGTRB] [^111Ecagd]. Store securely and dispose of unused medication promptly to prevent misuse or accidental ingestion [^111Ecagd]. Discuss naloxone if overdose risk is present, and seek immediate care for overdose or severe side effects [^116T3Sjy] [^116XGTRB].

---

## Indication and appropriate use

Hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 mg is indicated for **short-term management of moderate pain** when nonopioid analgesics are inadequate [^113THkDZ]. It is not intended for chronic pain management or for use in opioid-tolerant patients without careful medical supervision [^notfound].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Usual adult dose**: 1 tablet every 4–6 hours as needed for pain.
- **Maximum daily dose**: 6 tablets (total acetaminophen 1,950 mg) to avoid liver toxicity.
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible, typically no more than a few days [^113THkDZ].

---

## Potential side effects and adverse reactions

Common side effects include:

- Drowsiness and dizziness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Constipation
- Lightheadedness
- Respiratory depression (especially at higher doses or when combined with other CNS depressants) [^116XGTRB]

Serious adverse reactions include:

- **Liver toxicity**: Due to acetaminophen component, especially with overdose or chronic use [^113kHyvB].
- **Respiratory depression**: Life-threatening, particularly in overdose or when combined with other CNS depressants [^116XGTRB].
- **Addiction, abuse, and misuse**: Hydrocodone is a Schedule II controlled substance with significant abuse potential [^111hepbB].

---

## Precautions and contraindications

Patients should **avoid alcohol** and other CNS depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, sleep aids) due to the risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [^116T3Sjy]. Use caution in older adults, those with hepatic or renal impairment, and in pregnancy because of increased sensitivity and risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^115bZfD2] [^115bQKnC]. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to hydrocodone or acetaminophen, severe respiratory depression, and concurrent MAOI use [^112Vyhag].

---

## Storage and disposal

Store securely, out of reach of children and others, to prevent accidental ingestion or diversion [^111Ecagd]. Dispose of unused medication promptly via a **drug take-back program** or by flushing if a take-back option is unavailable [^111Ecagd].

---

## Overdose and emergency situations

Recognize **overdose symptoms** — respiratory depression, extreme drowsiness, confusion, pinpoint pupils, and unconsciousness [^notfound]. If overdose is suspected, administer naloxone if available and call 911 immediately; naloxone effects are temporary, so emergency care is essential [^115Z8F3C].

---

## Patient counseling and education

- **Read the Medication Guide**: Provided by the pharmacist each time the medication is dispensed [^111b5EcP].
- **Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants**: Due to risk of respiratory depression and death [^116T3Sjy].
- **Do not drive or operate machinery**: Until you know how the medication affects you [^111Ecagd].
- **Report side effects**: Inform your healthcare provider of any adverse effects or concerns [^113CoB18].
- **Safe storage and disposal**: Keep secure and dispose of unused medication properly [^111Ecagd].

---

## Special considerations

In older adults, use lower initial doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity and risk of falls [^115bZfD2]. In pregnancy, prolonged use can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; use only if clearly indicated and with close monitoring [^115bQKnC]. For patients with hepatic or renal impairment, dose adjustments may be necessary; consult your healthcare provider [^112QxmW7].

---

Hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 mg is effective for short-term moderate pain but carries risks of side effects, misuse, and overdose. Patients should adhere strictly to dosing, avoid risky combinations, and store and dispose of medication safely.

### Improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: a randomized controlled trial [^116TATPd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of opioid analgesics in the United States has significantly increased in recent years. However, there is minimal consensus on what discharge counseling should accompany these high-risk prescriptions and large variations in what is done in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dual-modality (written and spoken) literacy-appropriate educational strategy on patients' knowledge of and safe use of opioid analgesics.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive discharged patients at an urban academic ED (> 88,000 visits) with new prescriptions for hydrocodone-acetaminophen were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care or the educational intervention. The educational intervention was a one-page information sheet about hydrocodone-acetaminophen, which was both given to the patients and read aloud by the research assistant (nonblinded). Follow-up phone calls were conducted 4 to 7 days after the visit to assess patient knowledge about the medication and self-report of activities associated with safety of use (e.g., double-dipping with acetaminophen, storage, use with alcohol or while driving).

Results

A total of 274 patients were enrolled; 210 completed follow-up (110 usual care and 100 intervention). No significant differences in baseline characteristics emerged between the study arms; 42% were male, and 51% were white, with a median age of 43 years. Half of patients had non-back pain orthopedic injuries (49.5%). On follow-up, overall knowledge was poor, with only 28% able to name both active ingredients in the medication. The intervention group had better knowledge of precautions related to taking additional acetaminophen (usual care 18.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.9% to 25.5% vs. intervention 38%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 47.7%; difference = 27.6, 95% CI of difference = 21.5 to 33.7) and knowledge of side effects (usual care median = 1, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 2 vs. intervention median = 2, IQR = 1 to 2; p < 0.0001). Additionally, those who received the intervention were less likely to have reported driving within 6 hours after taking hydrocodone (usual care 13.6%, 95% CI = 7.2% to 20% vs. intervention 3%, 95% CI = -0.3% to 6.3%; difference = 10.6, 95% CI of difference = 3.4 to 17.9). There was no difference between groups related to knowledge about drinking alcohol while taking hydrocodone (overall 18.1%) or knowledge that the opioid could be addictive (overall 72.4%).

Conclusions

This simple strategy improved several, but not all, aspects of patient knowledge and resulted in fewer patients in the intervention arm driving while taking hydrocodone. Integration of a patient education document into conversations about opioids holds promise for improving patient knowledge about these high-risk medications.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSAGE].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

- How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose

- To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency

- To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see WARNINGS; Adverse Reactions].

Serotonin Syndrome

Inform patients that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets could cause a rare but potentially life- threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^111J8Kvp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers.

Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:

- Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.

- Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1157AHc3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians seeing new patients already using opioid medication should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5). Although the clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of written agreements or treatment plans, clinicians and patients who clearly document a treatment plan including specific functional goals in advance of prescribing will clarify expectations about how opioids will be prescribed and monitored with an aim to improve patient safety, health, and well-being.

Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Many patients rank pain relief, nausea, vomiting, and constipation as important effects. The following elements are essential for communication and discussion with patients before starting opioid therapy:

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Pregnancy].

### A multifaceted intervention to improve patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: results of the ED EMCRandomized controlled trial [^1166Rg7g]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite increased focus on opioid prescribing, little is known about the influence of prescription opioid medication information given to patients in the emergency department (ED). The study objective was to evaluate the effect of an Electronic Medication Complete Communication (EMC 2) Opioid Strategy on patients' safe use of opioids and knowledge about opioids.

Methods

This was a three-arm prospective, randomized controlled pragmatic trial with randomization occurring at the physician level. Consecutive discharged patients at an urban academic ED (> 88,000 visits) with new hydrocodone-acetaminophen prescriptions received one of three care pathways: 1) usual care, 2) EMC 2 intervention, or 3) EMC 2 + short message service (SMS) text messaging. The ED EMC 2 intervention triggered two patient-facing educational tools (MedSheet, literacy-appropriate prescription wording [Take-Wait-Stop]) and three provider-facing reminders to counsel (directed to ED physician, dispensing pharmacist, follow-up physician). Patients in the EMC 2 + SMS arm additionally received one text message/day for 1 week. Follow-up at 1 to 2 weeks assessed "demonstrated safe use" (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes including patient knowledge and actual safe use (via medication diaries) were assessed 2 to 4 days and 1 month following enrollment.

Results

Among the 652 enrolled, 343 completed follow-up (57% women; mean ± SD age = 42 ± 14.0 years). Demonstrated safe opioid use occurred more often in the EMC 2 group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 5.06), but not the EMC 2 + SMS group (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 0.90 to 3.90) compared with usual care. Neither intervention arm improved medication safe use as measured by medication diary data. Medication knowledge, measured by a 10-point composite knowledge score, was greater in the EMC 2 + SMS group (β = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.09 to 1.06) than usual care.

Conclusions

The study found that the EMC 2 tools improved demonstrated safe dosing, but these benefits did not translate into actual use based on medication dairies. The text-messaging intervention did result in improved patient knowledge.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opiods and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opiod doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in who, lower doses are insufficiently effective and in who, the expected benefits of using a higher dose opiod clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apadaz) [^117MfBLR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Maximum Daily Acetaminophen Use

Advise patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day and call their healthcare provider if they have taken more than the recommended dose. Advise patients not to take APADAZ in combination with other tramadol or acetaminophen-containing products, including over-the-counter preparations [(see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSAGE].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see WARNINGS; ADVERSE REACTIONS].

5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:

Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.
Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:
www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG
Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.
Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of other CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients and/or Caregivers, Overdosage].

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^117WduoB]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management at hospital discharge — risk factors and patient education: Sustained prior opioid use (i.e., opioid use for at least 6 months) significantly increases the likelihood of long-term opioid use after surgery or admission for trauma, and other patient risk factors include patient age, socioeconomic status, history of psychiatric disorders, and intensity of the surgical intervention. Much less information is available regarding the influence of preoperative and in-hospital opioid type (e.g., hydrocodone vs. oxycodone vs. sustained-release vs. synthetics), and available information is highly confounded by small study samples, single center practice, and selection/ indication bias. A general recommendation is to discharge patients on a type and dose of opioid comparable to that performing adequately in the inpatient environment following a surgery. Educate patients prior to discharge regarding the risk factors associated with sustained prescription use, an anticipated plan for weaning from opioids, and an envisioned timeline for transition to nonnarcotic analgesics. Include discussions about the role of nonpharmacologic pain management modalities, cognitive-behavioral techniques, self-efficacy and optimism, and other nonpharmacologic adjuncts such as ice packs. Have a clear plan for outpatient follow-up and decide if renewal of opioid medications may occur beforehand or only at the time of office reevaluation.

Results

The survey response rate was 8.9% (n = 1,111), and of the patients who met the inclusion criteria the survey completion rate was 85.9% (n = 152) (Figure 1). Participant demographics and characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The majority of patients included in this study were female and aged 35–64 years. The most common types of pain for which opioids were prescribed were back/neck pain and arthritis, and the most commonly prescribed opioids were hydrocodone/acetaminophen and oxycodone/acetaminophen. Greater than 50% of patients were prescribed only an immediate-release or short-acting (IR/SA) opioid.

Education about opioid medication disposal

Forty percent (n = 60) of patients reported that they received information about the importance of properly disposing of unused opioid medication, and of these 50% (n = 30) reported that they received the information from a pharmacist and 33.3% (n = 20) reported that they received the information from a prescriber or someone affiliated with the prescriber. Similarly, 36.2% of patients reported that they received information about appropriate methods for disposing of unused medication, and of these 45.5% (n = 25) received the information from a pharmacist and 45.5% (n = 25) received the information from their prescriber or someone affiliated with their prescriber. This information was communicated to patients most frequently in the setting of an in-person conversation (47%) or provided in the form of printed material containing all of the necessary information (34.7%). Additional forms of communication included printed material with a link to a website to obtain more information (8.7%), a conversation over the phone (4.4%), and electronic communication (4.3%). Additionally, 12.5% (n = 19) of patients reported that they received a reminder to dispose of unused opioid medication from a pharmacist, prescriber, or someone other than a health care provider.

### Development and validation of the patient opioid education measure [^115fWQD8]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, prescribing of opioid analgesics for the management of chronic nonmalignant pain has steadily risen. As a result of increased prescribing, rates of opioid-related addiction, overdose, and death have also escalated.–To combat potential misuse and diversion, strategies have been developed, such as use of pain management agreements cosigned by the patient and physician to establish rules and expectations concerning chronic pain management and prescription of opioid analgesics. Such contracts may provide authority for physicians to request routine urine drug tests and mandate regular office visits to evaluate patient response to medication. A description of significant withdrawal signs and symptoms is usually included in the agreement to inform patients about possible health consequences if the contract is broken because of patient noncompliance.

Understanding and acting upon medical-related information and instructions pose significant obstaclesfor the more than one third of American adults with basic or below-basic health literacy skills. Patients with limited health literacy skills often lack medical-related knowledgeand experience difficulty comprehending instructions and demonstrating intended medication administration and dosing.–Moreover, while an abundance of patient education materials, eg, prescription and over-the-counter medication labeling, pharmacy-generated information sheets, and medication guides approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are widely available, most are of minimal use due to poor visual presentation and exceedingly high reading demands.–Additionally, the readability and formatting characteristics of typical patient-physician opioid pain management contracts far exceed the actual health literacy skills of American adults.

Improper opioid dosing related to patients not understanding the prescription directions results in a significantly increased risk of overdose and death.–Arguably, a patient must possess adequate opioid-related knowledge (eg, side effects, contraindications, proper handling, and storage) not only to control chronic pain, but also to manage opioid medication as prescribed by the physician. While a wide collection of patient-centered opioid-related measurement tools (eg, self-efficacyand bowel function index) are available, a tool designed to assess an individual's knowledge about opioid analgesics does not currently exist. To address this gap, the present study developed a content-valid, understandable, readable, and reliable Patient Opioid Education Measure (POEM). It was anticipated that patient responses to POEM items would enable clinicians to identify knowledge gaps related to chronic opioid therapy more rapidly and tailor their counseling accordingly.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### The FDA acetaminophen advisory committee meeting-what is the future of acetaminophen in the United States? The perspective of a committee member [^113kHyvB]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional acetaminophen toxicity is a common problem throughout the world but particularly in the more developed countries. To deal with the problem, several countries have attempted to decrease the risk of acetaminophen overdose by reducing package sizes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a joint meeting recently of three Advisory Committees to consider the issue of unintentional acetaminophen-related toxicity and to explore strategies to address the problem.

Proposals and Recommendations

Three strategies addressed the issue of dose reduction as a way to decrease morbidity and mortality. The FDA proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dose from 4,000 to 3,250 mg, reducing the maximum individual dose from 1,000 to 650 mg and relegating 500 mg tablets to prescription status. The Committees voted in favor of each of those initiatives. Restricting the number of doses that could be purchased by regulating package sizes, as has been done in some European countries, was proposed, but rejected by the Committees. Proposals also addressed the elimination of nonprescription and prescription acetaminophen combination products (e.g., multi-symptom cold relief combinations and acetaminophen/opioid combinations) as a strategy to decrease unintentional poisoning when individuals unknowingly take different products, all of which contain acetaminophen. The Committees rejected the proposal to eliminate the nonprescription combinations but recommended the elimination of prescription combination products. Currently, liquid acetaminophen is available in the United States in three different concentrations. To reduce the confusion associated with the variance in concentrations the Committees voted to have a single concentration for all acetaminophen liquid products. Finally, the Committees voted, almost unanimously, to encourage the FDA to place a boxed warning in the product information to create awareness among prescribers and pharmacists about acetaminophen toxicity and to educate their patients accordingly.

Conclusions

Many of the recommendations were not evidence-based but instead have an anecdotal basis. However, the Committees are advisory to the FDA, their recommendations are not binding and it remains to be seen which of the recommendations will be implemented.

### Development and validation of the patient opioid education measure [^116cemja]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, the POEM shows great promise as a measure of patients' knowledge and expectations regarding chronic opioid use. It is anticipated that the POEM can aid clinicians in identifying patients at greatest risk of limited knowledge regarding opioids. This could be accomplished, for example, by administration of the POEM by telephone or in person following initial prescription of an opioid analgesic. Any knowledge deficits identified would then become the focus of patient or caregiver counseling. The POEM should be tested and cross-validated in diverse patient populations. Future areas of interest concerning use of the POEM could include examining the reciprocal relationship between knowledge and outcome expectations and adequacy of pain control.

### Subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects profile of hydrocodone / acetaminophen and oxycodone / acetaminophen combination products [^114qSeRM]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare within the same individuals two typically prescribed doses of hydrocodone/acetaminophen and oxycodone/acetaminophen products for their subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects in healthy volunteers.

Design

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, six-session clinical laboratory study, enrolling 16 healthy participants (27.2 ± 4.4 years of age). Participants received 5 mg hydrocodone/325 mg acetaminophen, 10 mg hydrocodone/650 mg acetaminophen, 5 mg oxycodone/325 mg acetaminophen, 10 mg oxycodone/650 mg acetaminophen, 650 mg acetaminophen, and placebo in different sessions.

Results

Oxycodone/acetaminophen and hydrocodone/acetaminophen at the 5-mg opioid dose produced few subjective effects and no significant psychomotor impairment. Relative to placebo, the 10-mg oxycodone combination produced a wider spectrum of subjective effects that were statistically significant than did the 10-mg hydrocodone combination. The 10-mg oxycodone combination also produced a greater degree of miosis than the 10-mg hydrocodone combination. Both drug combinations impaired psychomotor performance at the 10-mg opioid dose.

Conclusions

The results of this study, albeit in pain-free individuals, may inform physicians who prescribe, and pharmacists who dispense, two widely prescribed opioid/acetaminophen combination products on how patients might be feeling from the drugs. Patients prescribed either of the two opioid/acetaminophen combination products may experience a number of subjective effects, including effects that would contraindicate certain activities, and they should be cautioned accordingly. However, this study documented rather large differences in magnitude of subjective effects between 10 mg oxycodone/650 mg acetaminophen and placebo, and physicians and pharmacists, and ultimately patients, should be aware of these differences.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline — pre-operative opioid and pain management education in post-surgical populations showed benefits without worsening pain outcomes: the pre-operative education group showed a significant decrease in critical outcomes of requested opioid prescription refills and prolonged opioid use at both short-term and over two year follow-up periods, while findings from multiple studies consistently showed non-inferiority in important short term outcomes of average and total pain scores. Education content included pain management education on the use of multi-modal pain regimens such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and non-pharmacologic strategies, and perioperative reinforcement of pre-operative education may be a helpful strategy to enhance patient retention, with one trial using a laminated card. The Work Group determined there are no direct harms related to education of patients and noted that in most trials, the education was not longer than seven minutes, which was considered feasible for real-world implementation. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and stated this is a Reviewed, New-added recommendation; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

Discussion

The POEM was designed to assess patients' comprehensive understanding of opioid medication instructions/counseling and outcome expectations related to long-term chronic pain management with opioid analgesics. By design, the POEM includes a collection of open-ended knowledge items encompassing six domains, ie, medicolegal issues, prescribing policies, safe use and handling, side effects, pharmacology, and warnings, designed to be nonthreatening and/or leading. For these particular POEM items, an open-ended assessment approach was employed over true-false and nonmultiple choice formats to reduce guessing and allow the opportunity to gauge patients' degree of understanding of these concepts. Initial psychometric analysis of the POEM suggests that this tool has good validity and reliability in measuring patients' knowledge and outcome expectations regarding the prescription of long-term opioids.

Overall reading demand of the POEM was below the sixth grade level. While the POEM was designed to be verbally administered, assessment of reading level remains pertinent because patients' aural literacy and/or listening comprehension capacity are critical in assuring that items are understandable and interpreted as intended.

Even while very few patients answered two of the individual POEM items correctly, these items were retained because of their importance to proper opioid use. For example, the POEM item with the fewest number of patients answering correctly addresses a critical concept, ie, "Where do you keep or store your pain medicine at home?", regarding proper handling. Importantly, our results mirror a recent study where knowledge of proper home storage was minimal among a sample of emergency department patients prescribed opioids.

The main strength of the study was the application of concept mapping to generate candidate POEM items. Additionally, a diverse mix of individuals, including pain specialists, primary care physicians, and nonclinicians, submitted and assessed POEM statements for importance and relevance. Another strong point was the way in which the POEM was designed and subsequently qualitatively evaluated by a team of instrumentation specialists prior to being pilot-tested with patients. Formatting of POEM knowledge items is also a study strength. Specifically, open-ended versus close-ended (true/false/do not know and/or multiple choice) response options were used to gauge patients' degree of understanding by having them describe in their own words their understanding of medicolegal issues, prescribing policies, safe use and handling, side effects, pharmacology, and warnings. Lastly, test-retest reliability of the POEM was very strong.

WARNINGS

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets contain hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablet exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and reassess all patients receiving Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

Patient education materials on postoperative pain control and opioid use — questionnaire content: The materials include items such as "In the first four days after surgery, how much did pain interfere with your ability to sit in a chair, stand or walk?" and "In the first four days after surgery, how much did pain interfere with your ability to eat and swallow?", ask "What medications did you use to manage your pain? Please check all that apply:" with options including "NSAIDS: □ Aspirin □ Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) □ Naproxen (Aleve) □ Celecoxib (Celebrex)" and "Nerve pain medications: □ Gabapentin (Neurontin) □ Pregabalin (Lyrica)", and list opioids such as "Tramadol (Ultram)", "Codeine with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3 or #4)", "Hydrocodone (Norco, Vicodin, Lortab)", "Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)", "Oxycodone (OxyContin)", and "Oxycodone with acetaminophen (Percocet)". Additional follow-up questions include "If you were given a prescription for opioids, how many opioid pills were you prescribed?", "Did you fill the prescription?", "Did you need more pills?", "How long did you need opioids for pain control (e.g. 5 days, 7 days, 14 days, 1 month)?", "Were you instructed to use the lowest dose of opioids for the shortest amount of time?", and "Did you experience any of the following opioid side effect symptoms (check all that apply): □ Nausea □ Vomiting □ Constipation □ Drowsiness □ Itching □ Dizziness □ Depression".

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen [^111wfSWs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed,(including anincrease in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see WARNINGS]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets

Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of opioid (including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Educational needs and preferences of adult patients with acute pain: a mixed-methods systematic review [^115fBc4n]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

3.3. Thematic synthesis

Several educational needs were identified when combining quantitative outcomes and qualitative findings from the retained studies (Table 4). The most frequently reported educational need was what to expect in terms of pain (subthemes: intensity, type, location, duration) (19/32; 59%): "It would have preferred more information on the different types of pain you go through. What this fracture and the operation do to the foot and where the pain comes from. And about the prognosis, how long it will take. ", followed by pain medication (subthemes: type, how and when to take it) (12/32; 38%): "The painkillers were quite strong. I was discharged and wasn't told how to use and dose these medications, so I had to look this up myself. " Other educational needs were identified less frequently and in a similar proportion of studies, including pain management (subthemes: various treatment options, self-management) (10/32; 31%): "I want to be able to at least learn some things that I can add to my knowledge and repertoire of managing my health. "; prevention of opioid use disorders (subthemes: information on risks and benefits, how to wean off) (9/32; 28%): "When I talk about addiction, it seems that the doctors didn't care too much". "But, in my case, my doctor, you know, he didn't tell me: okay, we're going to wean slowly and we're going to go with the recovery. "; and non-pharmacological approaches for pain management (types, how and when to use them) (9/32; 28%): "I've heard different things for your neck. You should or shouldn't turn and stretch from one way or another. One person will tell me one thing, and another will tell me a different thing. So, I'm hoping for the education of proper or right things to do. " The least frequently identified educational needs for which quotes were not always available were adverse effects of analgesics (subthemes: types, probability, prevention, treatments) (7/32; 22%); understanding the cause of pain (subthemes: causes, severity of the problem) (7/32; 22%); strategies to avoid aggravating pain (4/32; 13%); and healthcare professional to contact for pain management issues (4/32; 13%)

Patient education and shared decision making for postoperative analgesia — guidance and rationale emphasize informing patients and collaborative planning. "The purpose of this statement is to educate patients about analgesic options to promote informed, shared decision making while developing the postoperative analgesia plan". The plan's objective is "to control postoperative pain while minimizing adverse events associated with analgesics". Opioids are effective but carry risks "such as nausea or constipation" and can lead to "addiction and death from respiratory failure". Nonopioid medications and nonpharmacologic interventions "may be incorporated into the analgesic treatment plan to decrease the need for opioids", though these "may also have risks". Professional "CPGs… recommend that a postoperative analgesia plan be developed in conjunction with the patient and agreed upon through shared decision making", and "patients be informed about all elements of analgesic treatments options, including risks and benefits". Stated benefits include "incorporation of patient values and preferences… promotion of shared decision making", encouragement of nonopioid and nonpharmacologic options, and opportunities to discuss opioid/OUD risks, address misperceptions, curtail overuse, and counsel about opioid use; stated risks/costs include "time expended", possible anxiety, reduced use when needed, and nonadherence. The benefit–harm assessment notes "Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the "Policy level: Recommendation". Shared decision making "has been shown by many RCTs to improve knowledge gain by patients, increase patients' confidence in decisions, and lead to more active patient involvement", although "There are no studies that measure the outcomes from informing patients specifically about the benefits and risks of postoperative analgesics".

### Prescriber education interventions to optimize opioid prescribing in acute care: a systematic review [^112LGXfn]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid medications are frequently used effectively for analgesia in acute settings, however, they are associated with dependence and addiction, and were implicated in 47,600 American fatalities in 2017. Evidence suggests that despite guidelines and professional body recommendations, acute prescribing remains highly variable. Educational interventions targeting prescribers have potential to optimize prescribing in-line with evidence-based best practice.

Objectives

To identify the objective impacts of education interventions on opioid prescribing in the acute care setting.

Study Design

A systematic literature review.

Setting

The electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane for works published until December 31, 2018. Bibliographies of relevant studies and the gray literature were also searched.

Methods

Databases were searched for interventional studies (clinical trials and pre- and poststudies). Studies describing an educational intervention delivered to clinicians and reporting at least one objective measure of opioid use in the acute care setting were included. Studies reporting only subjective outcomes and those focused on chronic pain or set in primary care were excluded. Two reviewers (RB, TB) extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies using the Downs and Black Tool.

Results

Nine studies met inclusion criteria; all used pre- and postdesigns. Three studies described stand-alone education, and the others described multifaceted interventions. All 9 interventions significantly reduced at least one of the following: high-risk agent use including meperidine use by up to 71%; total or daily dosage of opioids at discharge, including median morphine milligram equivalence (MME) from 90 mg to 45 mg per patient; and quantity of medications such as oxycodone supplied to patients, halved in one study from 6,170 expected to 2,932 supplied tablets. No increase in pain complaints or prescription refill requests were reported in those studies assessing these outcomes. The longest study examined prescribing 15 months after education delivery, reporting sustained practice changes.

Limitations

Overall study quality was fair to poor. Significant heterogeneity in settings, patient groups, methodologies, and outcomes prevented pooled quantitative analysis. No studies examined all available opioid agents or formulations.

Conclusions

These findings support prescriber education as an effective strategy to reduce opioid use and optimize prescribing in acute settings. Further research, particularly high quality randomized studies, describing the impact of education on all available opioid formulations and total MME is required. Reviewing the existing literature has offered useful models that can be implemented to improve care with opioid prescribing in acute settings.

Key Words

Opioids, education, physician education, prescriber education, opioid education, opioid prescribing, systematic review, prescriptions, prevention.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^116DkUUj]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Parent counseling and patient education: PHCPs should counsel parents on the potential adverse effects of opioids, including constipation; pruritis; nausea and vomiting; sedation; respiratory suppression; and/or the possibility of tolerance, dependence, addiction, or death. The subcommittee recommends that all patients and caregivers of patients with pain or expected pain be provided with written educational and instructional materials on nonpharmacologic therapies and nonopioid and opioid medications, and evidence indicates that providing these materials improves pain control and reduces opioid prescribing. Educating patients and families on multimodal, nonpharmacologic approaches to pain control, risks of opioid use, and existing data surrounding pain duration and severity can facilitate shared decision-making and temper expectations if patients and families specifically request opioid prescriptions to manage and treat pain.

Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and prolong opioid adverse reactions, and which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see WARNINGS], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets -treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When adding CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets treated patients, evaluate patients at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

General medical data on pain and its treatment

Patients were asked about their pain in general (Table 1). Most patients had experienced pain for more than 6 months (74.3%) and reported to know the cause(s) of their pain (73.2%). The main cause identified was cancer (75.0%), followed by treatment (25.0%) and mood (8.3%). About 30% of patients thought that experiencing pain was "normal" in their setting and 79.1% stated that there were solutions to relieve pain.

Table 1
Patients' pain and treatment (n = 72) a

Concerning pain treatment, 91.6% declared knowing which pain treatment they were taking and 84.7% declared taking it in full. Yet, when patients were asked to list their pain treatment, only 30.6% responded as prescribed by the doctor. To avoid any ambiguity due to the prescription of paracetamol "as needed", we further compared listed and prescribed pain treatment. Here again, more than half of the patients (51.4%) did not know exactly what their pain treatment was, ie, 48.6% were able to name correctly the drugs they were receiving. Strong opioids were received by 62.5% of patients.

Pain characteristics obtained with the BPI

Back pain was the most common pain experienced by 52.8% of the patients. Participants' pain intensity, interference, and relief are summarized in Table 2. Moderate-to-severe pain was noted for 83.3% of the patients. On a scale of 0–10, patients rated their worst pain at 6.5 (SD, 1.9), with the average pain rated at 4.9 (SD, 1.9). Pain was relieved for 51.9% of patients. The mean pain interference score was 4.6 (SD, 1.1). Daily life and normal work, mean scores 6.0 (SD, 2.2 and 2.8, respectively) were strongly impacted by pain. In contrast, pain was less likely to impact relations with other people, mean score 3.4 (SD, 2.8). 23.6% of the patients had a negative PMI score, indicating inadequate pain management.

### Current state of the opioid epidemic as it pertains to pediatric orthopaedics from the advocacy committee of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America [^113UY9d5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The opioid epidemic in the United States has reached crisis proportions. Urgent response is needed. Hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen is the most prescribed drug in the United States. The most common source of opioids available for misuse is the unused portions of postoperative prescriptions. Among high school seniors, 80% of those who reported nonmedical use of prescription opioids previously had legitimate prescriptions but recreationally used leftover doses. Roughly one-quarter of patients do not take any of their postoperatively prescribed opioids and the remainder take one-third to two-thirds of the prescribed doses.

Methods

A summary of the literature is presented beginning from historical perspective to current status and pertinent strategies in dealing with this complicated problem. This review includes data from an electronic survey of the members of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) with regard to the prescriptions they would provide for 7 treatment scenarios.

Results

Strategies for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of management of pain as well as strategies for education, research, and advocacy are presented. The Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America survey yielded 264 respondents. The 3 most commonly used opioid medications were hydrocodone, oxycodone, and acetaminophen with codeine, in that order, for most of the scenarios. The time period covered by postoperative prescriptions varied considerably.

Conclusions

The magnitude of this problem is overwhelming. Education of care providers, patients and families, standardization of narcotic prescribing practices which incorporate patient characteristics, and appropriate plans for disposal of unused narcotics are immediate concepts to consider in correcting this problem. Long-term issues to tackle will be changing patient a family expectations, legislation, and obtaining additional resources directed towards this issue.

### Using M-health tools to reduce the misuse of opioid pain relievers [^114K8fqR]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) patients are among the many groups at risk for prescription drug overdose. There is limited research on how best to communicate with ED patients about options for pain management and the risks of opioids. The aim of this study is to pilot test a web-based, patient-centred educational programme that encourages the patient to have an informed discussion about pain medication options with their ED provider.

Methods

This multisite, randomised trial will evaluate an m-health programme designed to aid the patient in making an informed decision about their pain treatment. Patients reporting to the ED with an injury-related or pain- related chief complaint who agree to participate are randomised to receive the intervention programme, My Healthy Choices, or an attention-matched control. My Healthy Choices pairs tailored education with a patient decision aid to describe what opioid and non-opioid pain medications are, assess the patient's risk factors for opioid-related adverse effects, and produce a tailored report that patients are encouraged to share with their doctor. Data are collected through surveys at three time points during the ED encounter (baseline, immediately after the intervention and just before discharge), and at a 6-week follow-up survey. The primary outcomes are whether the patient prefers an opioid pain reliever (OPR) and whether the patient takes an OPR.

Discussion

We hope this programme will facilitate patient-provider communication, as well as reduce the number of prescriptions written for OPRs and thus the number of patients exposed to prescription opioids and the associated risks of addiction and overdose.

PRECAUTIONS

Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Storage and Disposal

Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. Inform patients that leaving hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home.

Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take -back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines.

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Inform patients that the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see WARNINGS]. Instruct patients not to share Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with others and to take steps to protect Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets from theft or misuse.

### Evaluation of patients' needs to design and assess a patient education program in cancer pain [^115aFMQn]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The geographical recruitment of our patients was representative of the file active of the participating hospitals since there were more inclusions in the major teaching hospitals, yet all the outlying centers participated. As patients' features were similar whatever the site where they were managed for cancer pain, we plan to include patients in steps 4 and 5 without imposing any proportional representativeness.

For this preliminary study, we make the decision to use the validated BPI, frequently used in trials. This choice reinforces the interest of our approach. Assessing the impact of pain on daily activities would indeed seem to be more appropriate, as it is less fluctuant, more realistic and more relevant than evaluating pain intensity in the context of TPE, which mainly aims to improve quality of life. In our patients, pain was reported to mainly impact daily life and normal work, areas on which educative programs are focused. Appropriate management of pain should ensure that it has a limited impact on daily life, thereby underlining the value of the educative approach. In the next stages of our research, the questionnaire will be used as the main assessment criterion. The benefit of TPE on the impact of pain will be defined as a 2-point decrease on a scale of 10 between the mean values of the seven items measured before and at the end of the program, which is considered to correspond to a clinically significant improvement. The BPI was also used to calculate the PMI, which allows the proper use of analgesics to be assessed. As almost one-quarter of our patients had a negative PMI score, inadequate pain management may be suspected. Unrelieved pain may also be related to patients not taking their medications as prescribed, for reasons highlighted in our study. Even though misconceptions about opioids remain common, TPE could allow them to better understand and manage pain treatment and to communicate appropriately with health care providers, despite the fact that this item was not identified as a priority by our patients. Medicine-taking is a complex human behavior and non-adherence is common, including in the field of pain.TPE aims at improving the understanding of pain, its treatment, and side effects. Above all, its objective is to allow patients to acquire the skills needed to make them active agents in their pain management and in their coping with cancer pain.

### Naproxen with cyclobenzaprine, oxycodone / acetaminophen, or placebo for treating acute low back pain: a randomized clinical trial [^113u1dHe]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for more than 2.5 million visits to US emergency departments (EDs) annually. These patients are usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, opioids, or skeletal muscle relaxants, often in combination.

Objective

To compare functional outcomes and pain at 1 week and 3 months after an ED visit for acute LBP among patients randomized to a 10-day course of (1) naproxen+placebo; (2) naproxen+cyclobenzaprine; or (3) naproxen+oxycodone/acetaminophen.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, 3-group study was conducted at one urban ED in the Bronx, New York City. Patients who presented with nontraumatic, nonradicular LBP of 2 weeks' duration or less were eligible for enrollment upon ED discharge if they had a score greater than 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). The RMDQ is a 24-item questionnaire commonly used to measure LBP and related functional impairment on which 0 indicates no functional impairment and 24 indicates maximum impairment. Beginning in April 2012, a total of 2588 patients were approached for enrollment. Of the 323 deemed eligible for participation, 107 were randomized to receive placebo and 108 each to cyclobenzaprine and to oxycodone/acetaminophen. Follow-up was completed in December 2014.

Interventions

All participants were given 20 tablets of naproxen, 500 mg, to be taken twice a day. They were randomized to receive either 60 tablets of placebo; cyclobenzaprine, 5 mg; or oxycodone, 5 mg/acetaminophen, 325 mg. Participants were instructed to take 1 or 2 of these tablets every 8 hours, as needed for LBP. They also received a standardized 10-minute LBP educational session prior to discharge.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was improvement in RMDQ between ED discharge and 1 week later.

Results

Demographic characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. At baseline, median RMDQ score in the placebo group was 20 (interquartile range [IQR],17–21), in the cyclobenzaprine group 19 (IQR,17–21), and in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group 20 (IQR,17–22). At 1-week follow-up, the mean RMDQ improvement was 9.8 in the placebo group, 10.1 in the cyclobenzaprine group, and 11.1 in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group. Between-group difference in mean RMDQ improvement for cyclobenzaprine vs placebo was 0.3 (98.3% CI, -2.6 to 3.2; P = 0.77), for oxycodone/acetaminophen vs placebo, 1.3 (98.3% CI, -1.5 to 4.1; P = 0.28), and for oxycodone/acetaminophen vs cyclobenzaprine, 0.9 (98.3% CI, -2.1 to 3.9; P = 0.45).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute, nontraumatic, nonradicular LBP presenting to the ED, adding cyclobenzaprine or oxycodone/acetaminophen to naproxen alone did not improve functional outcomes or pain at 1-week follow-up. These findings do not support use of these additional medications in this setting.

### Preoperative opioid education has No effect on opioid use in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^111JZcdJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a preoperative video-based opioid education reduced narcotics consumption after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in opioid-naive patients.

Methods

This was a single-center randomized controlled trial. Preoperatively, the control group received our institution's standard of care for pain management education, whereas the experimental group watched an educational video on the use of opioids. Patients were discharged with 30 × 5 mg/325 mg oxycodone-acetaminophen prescribed: 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours. They were contacted daily and asked to report opioid use and visual analog scale pain. A chart review at 3 months post-op was used to analyze for opioid refills.

Results

A total of 130 patients completed the study (65 control and 65 experimental). No statistically significant differences were noted in patient demographics between groups (P > 0.05). Patients in the education group did not use a statistically significant different number of narcotics than the control group throughout the first postoperative week (14.0 pills experimental versus 13.7 pills control, P = 0.60). No statistically significant differences were noted between groups at follow-regarding the rate of prescription refills (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

This study suggests that preoperative video-based opioid education may have no effect on reducing the number of narcotic pills consumed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Clinical Relevance

Data exist to suggest that preoperative video-based opioid education has an effect on postoperative consumption; however, the effect of this education in the setting of already-limited opioid-prescribing is not known.

### Extended-release hydrocodone-gift or curse? [^116enjwX]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid, which has been used for decades as a short-acting analgesic combined with acetaminophen (or less commonly ibuprofen). Several long-acting, non-acetaminophen-containing hydrocodone formulations are undergoing trials in the US under the auspices of the US Food and Drug Administration, and may be available shortly. This article reviews some of the advantages (including drug familiarity and lack of acetaminophen toxicity) and potential disadvantages (including altered use patterns and high morphine equivalent dosing) of such a medication formulation. We also discuss the abuse potential of long-acting versus short-acting opioids in general and hydrocodone specifically, as well as the metabolism of hydrocodone.

### Postoperative opioid consumption following hallux valgus and rigidus surgery: a guide to postoperative prescription writing [^116poz9P]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Prescribing postoperative pain medications is essential to foot and ankle surgery; however, prescribing an amount that results in an excess of pills has shown to lead to opioid abuse. The opioid epidemic has forced surgeons to analyze how we manage postoperative pain with a goal to prescribe the optimal number of pills that will reduce a patient's pain while limiting the amount that is left over. The purpose of this study was to develop a guideline for prescribing postoperative pain medication for hallux valgus and rigidus procedures. One hundred eighty-five opioid naive patients were followed after undergoing surgery for hallux valgus or hallux rigidus. The number of opioids consumed was obtained and compared to a number of variables. There were 28 different prescriptions given during the study. As the number of pills given decreased, so did the number of pills consumed (p = .08). Of the 185 patients, 14 (7.56%) received a refill. Ninety-five patients were available for opioid consumption data analysis. Those patients consumed a median of 36.7% and 39.1% of their prescription for hallux valgus and hallux rigidus procedures respectively. Smokers consumed 2.4 times the number of narcotics compared to nonsmokers (p = .002). The median number of 5–325 mg hydrocodone-acetaminophen pills consumed was 8.5 for distal metatarsal osteotomies and 10 for first metatarsophalangeal joint procedures. Body mass index, gender, number of procedures performed did not have a statistical difference in the number of opioids taken. Foot and ankle surgeons can reduce the amount of excess opioids by decreasing the initial prescription and educating the patient on proper pain management modalities.

### Managing severe pain and abuse potential: the potential impact of a new abuse-deterrent formulation oxycodone / naltrexone extended-release product [^111Q4yi5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

When to consider opioid analgesia

As a general rule, opioids are not usually the first-line agents to manage pain unless the pain is acute (e.g. traumatic pain or postsurgical pain) or overwhelmingly severe. Guidelines for various pain syndromes usually specify that nonopioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be utilized first and opioids trialed only if nonopioid therapy does not offer adequate analgesia.–Thus, patients with pain associated with osteoarthritis may first be administered acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and progress to opioids only if these agents do not provide adequate pain control.

Opioid therapy in an opioid-naïve patient should commence as a trial rather than the initiation of long-term therapy. The patient and caregivers should be informed about the potential risks as well as benefits of opioid therapy. In some cases, informed consent or another type of agreement should be signed to assure that the patient understands not just the risks of opioid therapy but the clinician's expectation for patient compliance as well. Patients should be educated about possible side effects, so that they are reported promptly. Clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if the expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh the risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function, and should consider how therapy will be discontinued if the benefits do not outweigh the risks. Clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Clinicians should review prescription drug monitoring program data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain.

### Tramadol / paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain [^112cY8Jc]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention and pain relief has been put forward as an ethical obligation of clinicians and a fundamental human right. However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a "do ask, do tell" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.

### Narcotic-free, over-the-counter pain management after wide-awake hand surgery [^115GVmw3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The United States consumes 80% of the global opioid supply and 99% of the hydrocodone supply, which makes hydrocodone with acetaminophen the most commonly prescribed medication.

Currently, there is no standardized education nor established guidelines for postoperative pain management. Many physicians, including most surgeons, have not received pain management training in narcotic prescribing. Physicians were asked to address pain as a "fifth vital sign" when, in fact, it was a symptom. Many surgeons do not know how much to prescribe or how much is actually consumed. Consequently, surgeons adopted standardized prescription routines without particular attention to the risks of drug dependence or diversion. They also adopted the same amount of narcotics their mentors used to prescribe.

Conversely, many patients report mild, tolerable pain after minor procedures and leave their narcotic prescriptions unfilled. This trend led several surgical fields to question the necessity of postoperative opioids in outpatient surgery including breast surgery, hernia repair, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

An option grid has been provided as a tool to implement shared decision making regarding nonopioid and opioid medications, based in part on the severity of patient-perceived pain, and nonpharmacologic options such as ice/heat, acupuncture, massage, and aromatherapy may be discussed case-by-case given limited data on benefits and risks.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (prolate) [^115TAoz3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS; Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Educating patients regarding pain management and safe opioid use after surgery: a narrative review [^115wYDRC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, there have been escalating concerns related to the opioid epidemic. With a steadily increasing opioid supply, it is critical to provide proper education to patients who are prescribed these medications. Education should be emphasized as a means of ensuring safe use and potentially as a strategy for curbing the opioid supply. Patients who undergo surgery are frequently prescribed opioids for postoperative pain; however, the content and delivery of information related to usage is inconsistent and often inadequate. Lack of education on postoperative pain management and opioid use places patients at risk for poor compliance and worse pain control. Furthermore, patients are often not properly educated on opioid-related side effects and risks or about safe behaviors when taking medications. The majority of patients are also not informed about how to store and dispose of leftover medications. Patients who are prescribed opioids require education preoperatively to cover the topics of pain management, opioid-related side effects, and risks, storage, and disposal. Evidence from various studies demonstrates that educational interventions improve knowledge and potentially lead to safer behaviors and reduced opioid use. Education can be provided in various formats with each having unique advantages and limitations.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115CA11j]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal pain management — key points and patient counseling — emphasizes clear patient expectations, proactive assessment, scheduled nonopioid analgesics, and planned de-escalation. The page states to counsel patients that the goal of pain management is not eradication of all pain and to inform patients that pain is normal after trauma and surgery, medications are meant to alleviate but not remove pain entirely, and pain may increase as mobility increases. Key points include that patient education about expectations for management is a highly effective intervention for pain management, to promptly investigate the cause of increasing pain rather than responding by increasing the analgesic dose or adding new medications, to administer acetaminophen and ibuprofen "around-the-clock" to maintain a constant serum level, and to have a protocol for safe de-escalation of analgesics as quickly as possible. The page defines multimodal analgesia (MMA) as the use of multiple analgesics, regional analgesia, and nonpharmacologic interventions to affect peripheral and/or central nervous system loci in the pain pathway, and notes that the MMA concept may be applied across the care continuum with strategies suited to each phase of care.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^116uKd73]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, education is a necessary, but insufficient, approach to improving prescribing and patient outcomes. In addition, the literature is mostly limited to opioids for chronic pain management rather than acute or postsurgical pain. Regardless, we recommend supporting opioid education efforts both in graduate medical education and through continuing education.

Literature that focuses on evaluating the effects of patient education is limited, but the few studies conducted support effective patient education. Strategies included educational pamphlets, – web-based interactive education, and clinician-delivered education. All interventions that included knowledge as an outcome demonstrated a significant effect, and many studies observed changes in risky behaviors, such as sharing pills, pill storage, saving and disposal of pills, driving, and taking more medication than prescribed.

Clinical Decision Support

- The panel recommends that prescribers, to the extent possible, develop, support, or both the implementation of clinical decision support regarding opioid prescribing in the electronic medical record (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

We reviewed the literature on the impact of clinical informatics interventions on opioid prescribing. A total of 14 articles were identified that included prescribing outcomes, and the quality of the evidence was low. Most of the studies used study designs that did not have any concurrent control group. This is a significant weakness because of the national attention surrounding the opioid crisis currently in lay press, politics, and medicine. Without concurrent controls, the effects seen after implementation of these interventions could be overestimates if prescribing was already decreasing due to the current climate around opioids. There were, however, 2 randomized controlled trials that demonstrated an effect on some outcomes. Most of the 14 studies included patients in the ED,– or specifically for patients receiving chronic opioid therapy.– Only 1 study assessed clinical decision support in an orthopaedic surgery population.

### Safe opioid storage and disposal: a survey of patient beliefs and practices [^113BGLsv]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Results from this survey showed that half of the patients who received an oral opioid prescription did not receive storage or disposal counseling from a healthcare provider. Most patients with unused opioids did not dispose of them — most notably 0% of patients with chronic pain — suggesting that it may be difficult to remedy opioid disposal practices. Counseling by a healthcare provider, and education addressing the potential for opioid diversion by a household member or visitor, may have a positive impact on safe medication storage practices. Further research aimed at improving the proper storage and disposal of unused medications and general safety surrounding opioids is warranted.

### Pain management in trauma: the need for trauma-informed opioid prescribing guidelines [^113fSNLu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient interactions surrounding pain management

Complexities surrounding opioid prescribing in trauma are reportedly accompanied by many challenging aspects of patient care as well, including proper patient education and counseling (n = 4) and the patient's perceptions of postdischarge follow-up (eg, pain expectations, care follow-up; n = 3). Sites indicated that transparent communication between providers and patients assists in counseling patients around expected pain and the potential risk of misuse (n = 4).

Each site reportedly takes an interdisciplinary approach when treating traumatic injury patients, in which non-prescribing staff members (eg, social workers, pharmacists) may also inform discharge prescribing and patient education. Similarly, two of the four sites noted that education materials, such as paper handouts, brochures, and flyers targeting proper opioid use and medication management, were helpful tools to facilitate communication with patients.

I've also made it part of my practice, I want to say within the last few months, as far as talking to [patients] about how to appropriately discard unused medications and give them available resources for that, so that it doesn't end up back in our community or in the hands of someone who it is not prescribed for. (West)

Furthermore, one site expressed a need to create and/or improve standardized language used for opioid prescription counseling in discharge summaries to improve patient education. Notably, this site reported that patients often did not read discharge summaries, and that improving or consolidating language may improve provider-administered education and minimize the burden for patients to review the materials. This importance of provider–patient communication reportedly extends to converting care from trauma providers to primary care providers, as transitioning patients from inpatient services to long-term outpatient management may coincide with barriers to effective and accurate care communication. Trauma providers reportedly anticipate that there is potential for primary care providers to be involved in discharge planning and long-term care of these patients (n = 3), thereby improving transition of care and patient outcomes.

### Emergency department patient perspectives on the risk of addiction to prescription opioids [^113YZ1GU]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize emergency department (ED) patients' knowledge and beliefs about the addictive potential of opioids.

Design

Mixed methods analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Urban academic ED (> 88,000 visits).

Subjects

One hundred and seventy four discharged ED patients prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen for acute pain.

Methods

The study analyzed data collected from a randomized controlled trial investigating patients' knowledge of opioids. ED patients discharged with hydrocodone-acetaminophen completed an audio-recorded phone interview 4–7 days later. This analysis focuses on responses about addiction. Responses were categorized using content analysis; thematic analysis identified broad themes common across different categories.

Results

Participants' mean age was 45.5 years (SD, 14.8), 58.6% female, 50.6% white, and the majority had an orthopedic diagnosis (24.1% back pain, 52.3% other injuries). Responses were categorized first based on whether the patient believed that opioids could be addictive (categorized as: yes, 58.7%; no, 19.5%; depends, 17.2%; or do not know, 4.6%), and second based on whether or not the patient discussed his/her own experience with the medication (categorized as: personalized, 35.6%; or not personalized, 64.4%). Cohen's Kappa was 0.84 for all categories. Three themes emerged in the thematic analysis: theme 1) patients expect to "feel" addicted if they are addicted, theme 2) patients fear addiction, and theme 3) side effects affected patient views of addiction.

Conclusion

In this sample, patients had misconceptions about opioid addiction. Some patients did not know opioids could be addictive, others underestimated their personal risk of addiction, and others overtly feared addiction and, therefore, risked inadequate pain management. Despite limited data, we recommend providers discuss opioid addiction with their patients.

### Acetaminophen and codeine [^113V8YDZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS). Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, and Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants).

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

Assessing Patients in Pain

According to the 2018 FDA blueprint, elements of assessment include patient history, screening tools for risks of chronic pain, queries of state prescription drug monitoring programs, pain and functional assessment scales, physical examination, and family, psychological, and social planning. The 2 questions and responses addressing this core educational message are shown in Figure 2. In both programs, a large majority of pretest participants (95% and 96%) recognized the importance of assessing functional outcomes.

Components of an Effective Treatment Plan

Essential components of an effective treatment plan include the establishment of treatment goals (including functional goals), possible constituents of a treatment plan (including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions), and a cooperative multidisciplinary approach with active patient engagement. In Program 1, nearly three-quarters of participants (73%) recognized the goal of an effective treatment plan (Figure 3). However, about half (49%) identified multimodal polypharmacy as the most effective and safe treatment plan. The pretest response to a similar question in Program 2 was substantially higher at 94%. In the same program, effective treatment goals of acute pain were recognized by 61%.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

PERCOCET should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of PERCOCET for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with PERCOCET. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with PERCOCET [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS; Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the prescribing of opioids for adult patients in the emergency department [^113Ymc9y]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Short-acting schedule II versus schedule III opioids — analgesic efficacy in acute pain is described as follows: Research evidence to support superior pain relief for short-acting schedule II over schedule III opioids is inadequate, and equianalgesic doses are equally efficacious, so there is no reason to consider an equianalgesic dose of a short-acting schedule II opioid more effective than a short-acting schedule III opioid. In a single-site Class II study, oxycodone 5 mg versus hydrocodone 5 mg (both with 325 mg acetaminophen) in 67 adolescent and adult subjects with acute fractures showed no differences in analgesic efficacy at 30 or 60 minutes, though constipation rates were higher for hydrocodone. In a Class I randomized trial of adults with acute or recurrent low back pain, oxycodone 5 mg with acetaminophen 325 mg (schedule II) versus hydrocodone 7.5 mg with ibuprofen 200 mg (schedule III) found no differences in pain relief, doses taken, global evaluations of efficacy, health status, or pain interference with work over an 8-day period, and overall, two randomized controlled trials comparing schedule II with III agents found no differences in analgesic efficacy.
