## Question

Is the use of sildenafil contraindicated in individuals with hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sildenafil is contraindicated in individuals with hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled absolute contraindications. Then, I should verify how hypertension appears in the Warnings and Precautions and whether uncontrolled hypertension is singled out. Next, I will review hemodynamic data in hypertensive populations. Then, I need to distinguish controlled versus uncontrolled hypertension in practice. Finally, I'll check key drug–drug interactions with antihypertensives and synthesize the bottom line, anchoring my assessment to FDA labeling and cardiovascular safety reviews [^11186FTA] [^112wvREf] [^11121TpE].

> Let me first confirm the formal contraindications in the FDA labeling, because if hypertension is listed there, that would end the discussion. The FDA labels for sildenafil list only three absolute contraindications: concomitant organic nitrates, concomitant riociguat or other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, and known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or its components, and hypertension is not included on that list [^11186FTA] [^116y2Kgr] [^1179DQLF].

> Wait, let me verify how hypertension is framed under Warnings and Precautions so I don't overstate safety. The FDA drug information advises caution in patients with cardiovascular instability, explicitly naming uncontrolled hypertension among conditions warranting caution; this is a precaution, not a contraindication, and reflects sildenafil's modest vasodilatory effect that can lower systemic blood pressure, particularly when combined with other hypotensive influences [^112wvREf] [^11121TpE] [^116BNcEj].

> I should now examine the hemodynamic effects in patients with hypertension to see if real-world data align with labeling. Across cardiovascular safety reviews and clinical experience, sildenafil produces small, generally single‑digit reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure that are typically well tolerated, including in men with stable, treated hypertension; importantly, in controlled hypertensives taking common background antihypertensives, sildenafil did not increase adverse events or symptomatic hypotension in comparative datasets [^113CyeaR] [^114V7e2n] [^112BdmrJ].

> Hold on, I should differentiate controlled from uncontrolled hypertension because that's clinically decisive. In patients with controlled hypertension, sildenafil is generally safe when used per labeling, whereas in uncontrolled hypertension the label's caution applies and blood pressure should be stabilized first to mitigate the risk of exaggerated hypotension from additive vasodilation; this is consistent with the precautionary stance in FDA resources and the observed hemodynamic profile [^112wvREf] [^116BNcEj] [^113CyeaR].

> Next, I need to check drug–drug interactions that matter in hypertensive patients. Sildenafil must not be coadministered with nitrates because of profound synergistic hypotension, and it is contraindicated with the sGC stimulator riociguat; beyond that, coadministration with standard antihypertensives is generally permissible with monitoring, though caution is advised with alpha‑blockers and in settings predisposing to hypotension, and strong CYP3A inhibitors can raise sildenafil exposure and hypotensive risk depending on indication and dose [^11186FTA] [^112wvREf] [^116y2Kgr].

> Let me double‑check broader safety signals so I'm not missing rare cardiovascular harms. Large safety summaries and post‑marketing analyses have not shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death when sildenafil is used according to labeling, which supports its cardiovascular safety in appropriately selected patients, including those with treated hypertension, though prudence is warranted in unstable cardiac conditions and uncontrolled blood pressure states [^113CyeaR] [^112BdmrJ].

> Putting this together, I should be precise with the bottom line. No, sildenafil is not contraindicated in individuals with hypertension; it can be used safely in patients with controlled hypertension, while uncontrolled hypertension warrants caution and stabilization prior to initiation, and absolute contraindications remain concomitant nitrates, concomitant riociguat or other sGC stimulators, and hypersensitivity to sildenafil or its components [^11186FTA] [^112wvREf] [^113CyeaR].

---

Sildenafil is not contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure [^112BdmrJ]. It is only contraindicated with nitrates [^11186FTA], riociguat [^117QmwgM], or hypersensitivity to sildenafil. In hypertensive patients, sildenafil causes modest, transient blood pressure reductions [^113CyeaR] and is generally safe when hypertension is controlled and nitrates are avoided [^114V7e2n]. Use caution in uncontrolled hypertension [^112wvREf] or with multiple antihypertensives [^116BNcEj], and monitor for hypotension or dizziness [^11121TpE].

## Pharmacological effects of sildenafil on blood pressure

Sildenafil inhibits PDE5 [^112BdmrJ], increasing cGMP [^112JcGzJ] and causing vasodilation, which produces modest, transient blood pressure reductions [^113CyeaR] [^114V7e2n]. In healthy volunteers, a single 100 mg dose reduced supine systolic/diastolic pressure by about 8/5 mmHg [^112BdmrJ], peaking at 1–2 hours and returning to baseline by 8 hours [^113CyeaR]. Similar modest effects are seen in patients with stable hypertension [^114V7e2n] or coronary artery disease [^113CyeaR].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding sildenafil use in hypertensive patients

Clinical trials and observational studies show sildenafil is generally safe in controlled hypertension [^114V7e2n], with no significant increase in adverse cardiovascular events or hypotensive episodes [^113CyeaR] [^112BdmrJ]. In a large safety database, sildenafil did not increase myocardial infarction [^113CyeaR], stroke, or serious cardiovascular events in men with stable hypertension or coronary artery disease [^112BdmrJ]. Likewise, among men with erectile dysfunction and hypertension [^114V7e2n], sildenafil did not raise rates of adverse events or hypotensive episodes.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Sildenafil is contraindicated with the following [^112wvREf]; it is not contraindicated solely due to hypertension [^112BdmrJ], though caution is advised in uncontrolled hypertension or when multiple antihypertensives are used [^11121TpE]:

- **Nitrates**: Concomitant use of nitrates [^11186FTA] or nitric oxide donors due to severe hypotension risk [^116y2Kgr].

- **Riociguat**: Concomitant use of riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator [^117QmwgM] [^11186FTA].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or its components [^11186FTA].

---

## Potential risks and side effects in hypertensive patients

In hypertensive patients, **sildenafil may cause**:

- **Hypotension**: Modest, transient blood pressure reductions [^112wvREf], especially with multiple antihypertensives [^116BNcEj].

- **Dizziness**: Dizziness or lightheadedness, particularly with alpha-blockers [^112wvREf] or other vasodilators [^11121TpE].

- **Cardiovascular events**: Rare serious events (myocardial infarction, stroke) have been reported [^111GQbms], often with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines support use of sildenafil in hypertensive patients when blood pressure is controlled and nitrates are avoided. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association note sildenafil is **generally safe in stable cardiovascular disease**, including controlled hypertension, with appropriate monitoring and precautions.

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To **minimize risks** in hypertensive patients, consider:

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Monitor before and after sildenafil administration [^116BNcEj].

- **Medication review**: Review antihypertensives and adjust as needed to reduce hypotension risk [^113YcVEb].

- **Patient education**: Educate on hypotension symptoms and when to seek medical attention [^1179DQLF].

- **Dose adjustment**: Start at lower doses (e.g. 25 mg) in patients on multiple antihypertensives or with controlled hypertension.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Sildenafil use** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| Controlled hypertension | Generally safe | - Monitor blood pressure <br/> - Avoid nitrates |
| Uncontrolled hypertension | Use with caution | - Monitor closely <br/> - Consider dose adjustment |
| Concomitant nitrates | Contraindicated | Severe hypotension risk |
| Concomitant riociguat | Contraindicated | Severe hypotension risk |
| Multiple antihypertensives | Use with caution | - Monitor blood pressure <br/> - Consider dose adjustment |

Sildenafil is **not contraindicated** in patients with high blood pressure [^112BdmrJ] and is generally safe in controlled hypertension [^113CyeaR] when nitrates are avoided [^11186FTA]. Use caution in uncontrolled hypertension [^112wvREf] or when multiple antihypertensives are used [^116BNcEj], and monitor for hypotension [^113YcVEb] or dizziness [^11121TpE].

### Sildenafil in patients with cardiovascular disease [^114V7e2n]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiologists are seeing increasing numbers of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED), which frequently coexists with cardiovascular disease. The pharmacologic profile of the new class of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors — specifically PDE5 inhibitors — and their potential effects on hemodynamic variables have therefore become significant factors in therapeutic decision-making. Most of the published data linking PDE5 inhibitor effects and cardiovascular disease relate to sildenafil, although two or more new agents are in various stages of development and clinical trials.

Sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors act on vascular smooth muscle, predominantly in the corpus cavernosum. PDE5 is not found in cardiomyocytes, and no effect of PDE5 inhibition on cardiac contractility has been demonstrated. On the basis of a safety database comprising thousands of men with ED, sildenafil has demonstrated minimal adverse effects in men with stable ischemia, hypertension, and/or severe coronary artery disease.

Sildenafil has modest effects on hemodynamic variables and has been shown to increase coronary artery flow reserve. Alone or combined with one or more antihypertensive medications, sildenafil did not increase the incidence of adverse events or hypotensive episodes. Sildenafil-associated decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the result of its vasodilator activity, have been modest. Sildenafil has decreased both elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated pulmonary artery pressures in patients with pulmonary vascular disease. Beneficial changes in hemodynamics have been observed.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate PO (also known as Viagra):

- **Cardiovascular events**: Use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, or left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

- **Hearing loss**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe LV outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.

- **Increased serum sildenafil levels with CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and reduce the starting dose to 25 mg daily.

- **Increased serum sildenafil levels with ritonavir**: Use caution in patients taking ritonavir, with a maximum dose of 25 mg every 48 hours for erectile dysfunction.

- **Priapism**: Use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.

- **Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### Cardiovascular safety of sildenafil citrate (Viagra): an updated perspective [^113CyeaR]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in modest reductions in blood pressure that are insufficient to stimulate a reflex increase in heart rate. These blood pressure reductions are similar for healthy men and men with coronary artery disease (CAD) or those who use antihypertensive drugs. Sildenafil does not affect the force of cardiac contraction, and cardiac performance is unaffected. It is mildly vasodilating in the coronary circulation and does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. During exercise and recovery, sildenafil does not cause clinically significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters in men with CAD and has no negative effects on coronary oxygen consumption, ischemia, or exercise capacity.

Clinical trial data from over 13,000 patients, seven years of international postmarketing data, and observational studies of more than 28,000 men in the United Kingdom and 3,813 men in the European Union reveal two important findings: (1) there are no special cardiovascular concerns when sildenafil is used in accordance with product labeling, and (2) the risk for serious events such as myocardial infarction or death is not increased. However, because safety has not been established in patients with recent serious cardiovascular events, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or retinitis pigmentosa, physicians should consult their local prescribing information before prescribing sildenafil for these patients.

Among men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil, the adverse event profile is similar overall to that in men without such conditions.

### Sildenafil [^11186FTA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with:

- **Concomitant use of organic nitrates**: Using organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated due to the increased risk of hypotension associated with sildenafil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Concomitant use of riociguat**: As a guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat's hypotensive effects may be potentiated by phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, including sildenafil.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients with known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of the injection should avoid its use. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and anaphylactoid reaction, have been reported in association with sildenafil.

These contraindications also apply to patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to sildenafil or any component of the injection.

### Adempas [^117QmwgM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**:

- **Pregnancy**: Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Adempas may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Adempas was consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Nitrates and nitric oxide donors**: Co-administration of Adempas with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form is contraindicated [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Phosphodiesterase inhibitors**: Concomitant administration of Adempas with specific PDE-5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) or nonspecific PDE inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or theophylline) is contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Do not administer within 24 hours of sildenafil. Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil.

- **Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators**: Adempas is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of other soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP) is also a contraindication for Adempas.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: A randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^113jyCuo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Patients were stratified by baseline 6MWD (< 325 or ≥ 325 m) and PAH etiology and randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive 12 weeks of treatment with sildenafil 1, 5, or 20 mg TID, respectively, during the double-blind phase of the study. Patients who completed the double-blind phase were eligible for a 12-week, open-label extension in which they received sildenafil 20 mg TID. Patients who withdrew during the study were to be followed up for safety assessments 30 days after the last treatment date.

- **Primary objective**: The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate a dose response for 6MWD for 1, 5, and 20 mg TID oral sildenafil. The hypothesis was that there is a dose that is significantly less effective than sildenafil 20 mg TID.

- **Secondary objectives**: Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety and tolerability of low-dose sildenafil during the 12 weeks of treatment in patients with PAH, and evaluation of the effects of sildenafil on perceived PAH-progression biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]/pro-BNP levels and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]). The study protocol and amendments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board and/or Independent Ethics Committee at each participating center; informed consent was obtained from all patients.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^112KjbH8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment allocation schedule during the open-label extension study allowed participants who did not tolerate the initial sildenafil dose three times daily to down-titrate to half the dose during the first six weeks. Participants could also down-titrate once during the first 12 weeks. All doses were to be administered at least six hours apart. Participants were asked to record doses in their diary cards and took the first dose in the morning at the hospital at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. They were asked to return unused drugs at each visit and were provided a sufficient supply for treatment until the next visit.

During the initial double-masked portion of the study, ophthalmologists conducted ophthalmic examinations and visual function tests in both eyes at baseline and week 12. The ophthalmic examinations included:

- **External inspection of the eye**: Slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior portion, funduscopy to examine the posterior segment.
- **Measurement of intraocular pressure**: Conducted by Goldmann applanation tonometry.
- **Visual function evaluation**: Best corrected visual acuity testing using a Snellen eye chart, the Farnsworth-Munsell D15 hue test for color, the Pelli-Robson test of contrast sensitivity, and the Humphrey visual field test.

The timing of ocular examinations and assessments in relation to the administration of oral sildenafil, diurnal intraocular pressure variability, or both, was not pre-specified. Intraocular pressure changes of less than 4 mm Hg from baseline to week 12 were predefined as being clinically not significant. Investigators recorded all observed changes and effects.

### Oral sildenafil reduces pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery [^113RVSJd]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment of postoperative pulmonary hypertension with intravenous (IV) pulmonary vasodilators is hampered by the lack of selectivity. Inhaled nitric oxide produces selective pulmonary vasodilation; however, it requires a special device, and weaning can cause rebound. Oral sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor. Sildenafil can produce sustained pulmonary vasodilatation in patients with hypoxic or primary pulmonary hypertension; however, experience with postoperative pulmonary hypertension is limited. We report our initial experience with eight patients who received oral sildenafil as adjunctive therapy for postoperative pulmonary hypertension.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of eight adult patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension who received oral sildenafil (25 to 50 mg) to facilitate the weaning of IV (milrinone, nitroglycerine, and sodium nitroprusside) and inhaled (nitric oxide) pulmonary vasodilators. Hemodynamic data were recorded before and 30 and 60 minutes after the initial dose of sildenafil.

- **Results**: After the initial dose of sildenafil, mean pulmonary artery pressure was reduced by 20% and 22% at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively (p < 0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased by 49% and 44% at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively (p < 0.05). Sildenafil had no clinically significant effects on cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, or systemic vascular resistance. Subsequent doses of sildenafil were administered at regular intervals, allowing successful weaning of concomitant pulmonary vasodilators.

- **Conclusions**: Oral sildenafil administration in patients post-cardiac surgery appears effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension and facilitating the weaning of other vasodilatory treatments.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113YcVEb]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Although PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil have similar efficacy and safety profiles, they differ in drug-drug interactions due to pharmacokinetic attributes. Sildenafil is highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, with metabolism by CYP2C9 to a lesser extent. Clearance of sildenafil is reduced when used concurrently with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased severity of adverse effects such as pronounced hypotension, syncope, and hearing and vision loss. Coadministration of sildenafil for PAH therapy with potent CYP inhibitors such as ritonavir and cobicistat is contraindicated. Ritonavir inhibits both sites of sildenafil metabolism at CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, resulting in a substantial increase in sildenafil levels. A single dose of sildenafil 100 mg with ritonavir 500 mg increased sildenafil exposure by 1000%. Cobicistat and ketoconazole are equally potent CYP3A4 inhibitors to ritonavir with no inhibition activity at CYP2C9, yet theoretically carry similar concerns for an increase in sildenafil concentrations.

It is important to recognize these interactions because ritonavir and cobicistat are used as inhibitors in combination medications for COVID-19 and HIV: nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, cobicistat, darunavir/cobicistat, darunavir/cobicistat/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Other CYP2C9 inhibitors do not have clinically established effects on sildenafil levels.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^114B45dp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Following approval of the clinical worsening indication in the United States in 2009, the FDA released Pfizer from the post-approval commitment to conduct a low-dose study. The study was subsequently terminated in June 2010 based on the recommendation of the data monitoring committee (DMC) because sildenafil 20 mg TID had been shown to reduce time to clinical worsening in PACES-1. Additionally, acknowledging recruitment issues, the study was unlikely to meet original enrollment targets. Accumulated results are presented here.

### Sildenafil for portopulmonary hypertension in a patient undergoing liver transplantation [^114Tiysk]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT) may be indicated in cirrhotic patients with underlying pulmonary artery hypertension. However, severe pulmonary artery hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) above 50 mmHg has even been considered a contraindication to LT. We present a cirrhotic patient with an mPAP of 56 mmHg measured using right heart catheterization (RHC) and with severely compromised physical capacity. She was first treated with sildenafil (Viagra), a potent novel vasodilator, and successfully transplanted later. The mPAP decreased with sildenafil to the level of 28–31 mmHg, and her general condition improved markedly. An LT using the piggyback technique was performed 16 weeks later. Despite two reoperations for bleeding, the outcome has been excellent. In conclusion, treatment of severe portopulmonary hypertension (PHT) with sildenafil is effective. If a decrease in mPAP is achieved with sildenafil, it may improve the result of LT, even though no evidence of reversibility of PPHTN exists.

### Sildenafil attenuates pulmonary arterial pressure but does not improve oxygenation during ARDS [^111AcF7a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a characteristic feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and contributes to mortality. Administration of sildenafil in ambulatory patients with pulmonary hypertension improves oxygenation and ameliorates pulmonary hypertension. Our aim was to determine whether sildenafil is beneficial for patients with ARDS.

- **Design**: Prospective, open-label, multicenter, interventional cohort study.

- **Setting**: Medical-surgical ICU of two university hospitals.

- **Patients**: Ten consecutive patients meeting the NAECC criteria for ARDS.

- **Interventions**: A single dose of 50 mg sildenafil citrate administered via a nasogastric tube.

- **Main results**: Administration of sildenafil in patients with ARDS decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 25 to 22 mmHg (P = 0.022) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 16 to 13 mmHg (P = 0.049). Systemic mean arterial pressures were markedly decreased from 81 to 75 mmHg (P = 0.005). Sildenafil did not improve pulmonary arterial oxygen tension but resulted in a further increase in the shunt fraction.

Although sildenafil reduced pulmonary arterial pressures during ARDS, the increased shunt fraction and decreased arterial oxygenation render it unsuitable for the treatment of patients with ARDS.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^115ijndA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In a previous study, improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) with sildenafil was not dose-dependent at the tested doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg three times daily (TID). This study assessed whether lower doses were less effective than the approved 20 mg TID dosage.

- **Methods**: Treatment-naive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind sildenafil 1, 5, or 20 mg TID; 12 weeks of open-label sildenafil 20 mg TID followed. Changes from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) for sildenafil 1 or 5 mg versus 20 mg TID were compared using a Williams test. Hemodynamics, functional class, and biomarkers were assessed.

- **Results**: The study was prematurely terminated for non-safety reasons, with 129 of 219 planned patients treated. At week 12, 6MWD change from baseline was significantly greater for sildenafil 20 mg versus 1 mg (P = 0.011) but not versus 5 mg. At week 24, 6MWD increases from baseline were larger in those initially randomized to 20 mg versus 5 or 1 mg (74 vs. 50 and 47 m, respectively). At week 12, changes in hemodynamic parameters were generally small and variable between treatment groups; odds ratios for improvement in functional class were not statistically significantly different. Improvements in B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly greater with sildenafil 20 mg versus 1 mg but not 5 mg.

- **Conclusions**: Sildenafil 20 mg TID appeared to be more effective than 1 mg TID for improving 6MWD; sildenafil 5 mg TID appeared to have similar clinical and hemodynamic effects as 20 mg TID.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 is highly expressed in the hypertrophied human right ventricle, and acute inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 improves contractility [^115KdA2K]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Sildenafil was recently approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The beneficial effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in pulmonary arterial hypertension are thought to result from relatively selective vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature and, on the basis of early data showing a lack of significant PDE5 expression in the normal heart, are thought to spare the myocardium.

- **Methods and results**: We studied surgical specimens from 9 patients and demonstrate, for the first time, that although PDE5 is not expressed in the myocardium of the normal human right ventricle (RV), mRNA and protein are markedly upregulated in hypertrophied RV (RVH) myocardium. Additionally, PDE5 is upregulated in rat RVH. PDE5 inhibition (with either MY-5445 or sildenafil) significantly increases contractility, measured in the perfused heart (modified Langendorff preparation) and isolated cardiomyocytes, in RVH but not in normal RV. PDE5 inhibition leads to increases in both cGMP and cAMP in RVH but not in normal RV. Protein kinase G activity is suppressed in RVH, explaining why the PDE5 inhibitor-induced increase in cGMP does not lead to inhibition of contractility. Rather, it leads to the inhibition of the cGMP-sensitive PDE3, explaining the increase in cAMP and contractility. This is further supported by our findings that, in RVH, protein kinase A inhibition completely inhibits PDE5-induced inotropy, whereas protein kinase G inhibition does not.

- **Conclusions**: The ability of PDE5 inhibitors to increase RV inotropy and decrease RV afterload suggests potential therapeutic benefits in conditions involving RVH.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^111EzB9r]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The findings of this study align with existing reports in the literature concerning the short-term effects of single-use sildenafil on measures such as color discrimination and visual sensitivity. Moreover, a recent study investigating the long-term use of sildenafil in healthy individuals found no significant difference from placebo in measures of visual function, including visual acuity, static perimetry, color discrimination, and key electroretinographic variables. In a study involving five patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who took high doses of sildenafil, up to 225 mg/day for one to four years, only modest electroretinographic changes in cone function were observed and no evidence of serious visual toxicity was found.

One visual disorder, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, has been reported as a rare event (18 instances in total) following the single use of sildenafil. Although no definitive link exists between these occurrences and the drug, the product label advises discontinuing the use of sildenafil in the event of sudden vision loss. Optic nerve heads that are relatively small, with small cup-to-disc ratios, have been reported to be at risk for non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Estimates of the overall incidence of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in the United States range from 2.52 to 11.8 men and from 2.14 to 9.2 women per 100,000 population aged over 50. In China, for adults aged over 40, the comparable estimate is six per 100,000. With intermittent use of sildenafil, however, the estimated incidence…

### Sildenafil exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit [^113zK9Xh]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Pulmonary hypertension causes substantial morbidity and mortality in infants. Although the Food and Drug Administration has approved sildenafil to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults, it is not approved for infants. We sought to describe sildenafil exposure and associated diagnoses and outcomes in infants.

- **Study design**: This retrospective cohort study examined neonates discharged from more than 300 neonatal intensive care units from 2001 to 2016.

- **Results**: Sildenafil was administered to 1,336 out of 1,161,808 infants (0.11%; 1.1 per 1,000 infants). No infants (0 out of 35,977) received sildenafil in 2001 versus 151 out of 90,544 (0.17%; 1.7 per 1,000 infants) in 2016. Among infants less than 32 weeks' gestational age with sufficient data to determine respiratory outcome, 666 out of 704 (95%) had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Among infants at or beyond 32 weeks' gestational age, 248 out of 455 (55%) had BPD and 76 out of 552 (14%) were diagnosed with meconium aspiration. Overall, 209 out of 921 (23%) died prior to discharge.

- **Conclusion**: The use of sildenafil has increased since 2001. Exposed infants were commonly diagnosed with BPD. Further studies evaluating the dosing, safety, and efficacy of sildenafil are needed.

### Sildenafil for improving outcomes in patients with corrected valvular heart disease and persistent pulmonary hypertension: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^116RY6Qw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH) worldwide is left heart disease (LHD), and valvular heart disease (VHD) is among the leading causes of this type of secondary PH. Pulmonary hypertension affects virtually all patients with severe symptomatic mitral valve disease and up to 65% of those with symptomatic aortic stenosis. Mitral and aortic valve diseases increase left atrial pressure, which, in turn, leads to an initially passive and potentially reversible increase in pulmonary pressures. Vascular injury then triggers a cascade of venous and small artery remodeling, non-reversible arterial PH, and eventually, right ventricular dysfunction. Regression of PH is frequently incomplete after the correction of the valvular lesion, persisting in up to 75% of patients with moderate or severe preoperative PH. Furthermore, PH sometimes develops later in patients who did not show PH before valve surgery. Once established, PH in corrected VHD is an untreatable risk factor of mortality and disability in the long term.

5-phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitors have proven clinical efficacy in pulmonary arterial hypertension but have shown discordant results in the field of LHD-PH. Nonetheless, sildenafil is frequently used off-label for treating this condition. In the setting of VHD, short-term studies have shown favorable effects of the drug in the immediate phases after surgery. To our knowledge, no clinical trial has yet addressed the chronic effects of PDE5 inhibitors aimed specifically at treating persistent PH after correction of VHD.

### The efficacy and safety of sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the different types of congenital heart disease [^114CbzvD]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The difference in underlying pathophysiology in different congenital heart disease (CHD) may influence clinical outcomes. It remains unclear whether the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) varies in different types of CHD. The potential effect of sildenafil on PAH related to CHD may be associated with shunt location.

In this 12-week, prospective, open-label, multicenter trial, 55 patients with CHD were divided into three groups: atrial septal defects group (ASD, n = 15), ventricular septal defects group (VSD, n = 24), and patent ductus arteriosus group (PDA, n = 16). Exercise capacity, hemodynamic parameters, and arterial oxygen saturation were assessed at baseline and after sildenafil therapy (25 mg, 3 times daily).

Six-minute walk distance significantly increased from 377.2 ± 68.7 m to 436.0 ± 70.4 m in patients with ASD, from 371.2 ± 66.0 m to 413.7 ± 83.1 m in VSD, and from 384.3 ± 90.2 m to 440.9 ± 71.8 m in PDA (P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, sildenafil also improved the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary blood flow index in the three groups, whereas no significant changes in systemic vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure were observed. However, arterial oxygen saturation was significantly improved in the ASD group only. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the three groups.

Sildenafil therapy seems to be effective and safe for PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, and PDA, although some clinical and hemodynamic parameters were c.

### Sildenafil for treatment of lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension: a randomised controlled trial [^114nYYxp]. Lancet (2002). High credibility.

Lung fibrosis can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension, limiting exercise tolerance and life expectancy. Furthermore, vasodilators might cause deterioration in gas exchange. Our aim was to compare the acute effects of sildenafil, nitric oxide, and epoprostenol in individuals with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised controlled, open-label trial in 16 individuals admitted to our hospital with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis. After the inhalation of nitric oxide (10–20 ppm), we assigned patients to either the maximum tolerated dose of intravenous epoprostenol (mean 8.0 ng/kg per min; n = 8) or oral sildenafil (50 mg; n = 8). Our primary objective was to assess pulmonary vasodilative potency (decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance index) of sildenafil by comparison with inhaled nitric oxide and infused epoprostenol. Analyses were by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: The pulmonary vascular resistance index was reduced by nitric oxide (-21.9%, 95% CI -14.1 to -36.2), epoprostenol (-36.9%, -24.4 to -59.6), and sildenafil (-32.5%, -10.2 to -54.1). However, the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance decreased only in individuals who received nitric oxide and sildenafil. Baseline measurements of multiple inert gas elimination showed right-to-left shunt flow (4.8%, 0.0–28.2) and little perfusion of low ventilation (V)/perfusion (Q) areas (0.1%, 0.0–13.0). Prostacyclin increased V/Q mismatch (shunt 16.8%, 10.8–35.9; low V/Q 3.8%, 0.0–13.0) and decreased arterial oxygenation. In contrast, nitric oxide showed reduced effects (4.5%, 0.0–18.0; 0.0%).

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GQt7v]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) carries a poor prognosis if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. The development and approval of 14 medications over the last several decades have led to a rapidly evolving approach to therapy and have necessitated periodic updating of evidence-based treatment guidelines. This guideline statement, which now includes a visual algorithm to enhance its clinical utility, represents the fourth iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians Guideline and Expert Panel Report on Pharmacotherapy for PAH.

- **Methods**: The guideline panel conducted an updated systematic review to identify studies published after those included in the 2014 guideline. A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were developed and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

- **Results**: Two new recommendations on combination therapy and two ungraded consensus-based statements on palliative care were developed. An evidence-based and consensus-driven treatment algorithm was created to guide the clinician through an organized approach to management and to direct readers to the appropriate area of the document for more detailed information.

- **Conclusions**: Therapeutic options for the patient with PAH continue to expand through ba

### Sildenafil inhibits altitude-induced hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension [^115QK4ew]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Exposure to high altitude induces pulmonary hypertension that may lead to life-threatening conditions. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effects of oral sildenafil on altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension and gas exchange in normal subjects were examined. Twelve subjects (sildenafil [SIL] n = 6; placebo [PLA] n = 6) were exposed for six days at 4,350 m. Treatment (3 x 40 mg/day) was started 6 to 8 hours after arrival from sea level to high altitude and maintained for six days.

- **Systolic pulmonary artery pressure**: Increased at high altitude before treatment (+29% versus sea level, p < 0.01) and then normalized in SIL (-6% versus sea level, NS) while remaining elevated in PLA (+21% versus sea level, p < 0.05).
- **Pulmonary acceleration time**: Decreased by 27% in PLA versus 6% in SIL (p < 0.01).
- **Cardiac output and systemic blood pressures**: Increased at high altitude then decreased similarly in both groups.
- **Pa(O(2)) and alveolar-arterial difference in O(2)**: Higher in SIL than in PLA at rest and exercise (p < 0.05).
- **Maximal O(2) consumption**: Altitude-induced decrease was smaller in SIL than in PLA (p < 0.05).

Sildenafil protects against the development of altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension and improves gas exchange, thereby limiting the altitude-induced hypoxemia and decrease in exercise performance.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial and open-label extension [^111qNbRP]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

The initial 12-week, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of sildenafil citrate for pulmonary arterial hypertension was conducted in 53 centers across multiple countries between October 2002 and November 2003 (NCT00644605). Participants who completed the double-masked study could enroll in an open-label, optimized dose extension study (NCT00159887). All participants gave written informed consent. Sildenafil has been widely prescribed since its market introduction in 2005, accumulating more than 118,000 patient-years of experience globally with sildenafil 20 mg three times daily.

The methods and primary results of both the double-masked study and the extension have been reported. A summary of the methods and details of the ophthalmologic assessments follows. Adult participants with pulmonary arterial hypertension, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of at least 25 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or lower at rest, were eligible.

Countries involved in the study:

- **Europe**: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom
- **Americas**: Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the United States
- **Asia-Pacific**: Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea
- **Africa**: South Africa

Participants could have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease, or pulmonary arterial hypertension following surgical repair of congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts at least five years previously. Patients with a six-minute walking distance of less than a specified threshold were included in the study.

### Pulmonary hemodynamic responses to brain natriuretic peptide and sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1156eWWB]. Chest (2006).

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) blunts hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in animal models, but its acute hemodynamic effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are not known. The aim of this study was to determine if human B-type natriuretic peptide is a safe and efficacious pulmonary vasodilator in patients with PAH and if the pulmonary hemodynamic effects are potentiated by phosphodiesterase inhibition.

Study objectives were pursued through an open-label study conducted in the medical ICUs of three tertiary care hospitals in New England. Thirteen consecutive adult patients undergoing right-heart catheterization and a pulmonary vasodilator trial for the initial evaluation of PAH were included. Interventions involved administering inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), i.v. epoprostenol, and a 3-hour infusion of BNP alone, and 1 hour after an oral dose of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil.

Results indicated that iNO and sildenafil alone decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) without a significant fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Epoprostenol decreased both mPAP and PVR. BNP alone had no significant effect on pulmonary hemodynamics, but the combination of sildenafil plus BNP decreased mPAP and PVR for up to 6 hours after stopping BNP. The decrease in mPAP with sildenafil plus BNP (± SE) was greater than after 1 hour of sildenafil alone (44.6 ± 3.8 to 40.6 ± 3.9 mm Hg, p = 0.027). An acute vasodilator response, defined as a decrease in mPAP > 10 mm Hg and end mPAP < 40 mm Hg, was seen in 0 of 8 patients with iNO, 1 of 13 patients with epoprostenol, and 0 of 13 patients with BNP.

### Changes in healthcare utilization and costs associated with sildenafil therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: a retrospective cohort study [^1131FnDR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a pathological narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles and small arteries, which causes elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This eventually results in the development of right ventricular failure and death. Dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope are the principal presenting symptoms of PAH. The disease is one form of pulmonary hypertension, broadly defined as increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, or veins.

In recent classification schemes for pulmonary hypertension, such as the Dana Point classification and guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society, PAH constitutes Group 1. It includes both idiopathic PAH and PAH associated with other specific diseases. Group 2 includes patients with pulmonary hypertension primarily due to left heart disease; Group 3 comprises those with pulmonary hypertension due to chronic pulmonary disease; Group 4 includes cases of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; and Group 5 includes miscellaneous types of pulmonary hypertension that do not fit into the other four categories.

In epidemiologic studies, the most common types of PAH, in order of decreasing frequency, are: idiopathic, PAH associated with connective tissue disease, and PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts in the heart. Worldwide, it is estimated that 130,000 to 260,000 persons have PAH. The mean age at diagnosis is over 50 years, and the disease is more common among women than men.

### Sex and the patient with cardiovascular risk factors: Focus on sildenafil [^112BdmrJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in men with cardiovascular disease. The introduction of sildenafil citrate, the first oral agent for the treatment of this disorder, has increased awareness about the risks of sexual activity in cardiac patients and raised concerns about the safety of sildenafil in patients being treated for coronary disease. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Sildenafil acts along the same general pathway as nitric oxide donors to increase cGMP levels and enhance erections.

Sildenafil is a modest vasodilator that causes small decreases in systemic arterial pressure and mild preload and afterload reductions. It does not cause major decreases in blood pressure when administered with one or more standard antihypertensive agents. Because PDE5 is also present in small amounts in the systemic vasculature, sildenafil can cause a synergistic and major decrease in pressure when combined with organic nitrates. The use of organic nitrates is the only contraindication to sildenafil use. Data on sildenafil in patients with recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, stroke, and recent life-threatening arrhythmias are not available, so the drug should be used with caution in patients with unstable cardiac conditions. Placebo-controlled and open-label phase 2/3 trials, including men with ischemic heart disease, did not show an increase in MI or serious cardiovascular events in patients treated with sildenafil versus a placebo.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^113rLP53]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the ocular effects and safety profile of chronic sildenafil oral dosing in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a 12-week, double masked, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III trial with an open label extension was conducted across 53 institutions worldwide.

Participants included 277 adults with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease or following congenital heart disease repair. All had a mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≥ 25 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of ≤ 15 mm Hg at rest.

- **Interventions**: During the double masked study, oral sildenafil doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg, or placebo (1:1:1:1), were administered three times daily for 12 weeks, alongside baseline drug treatment. In the extension study, participants initially receiving placebo, 20 mg, and 40 mg were transitioned to 40 mg three times daily, increasing to 80 mg three times daily at week 6. Post-unmasking, dosage was adjusted based on clinical need.

- **Main outcome measure**: Ocular safety was evaluated through ocular examinations, visual function tests, participant reports of adverse events, and a visual disturbance questionnaire completed by investigators at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 18 months, and yearly intervals.

Results indicated that objective assessments, including intraocular pressure and visual function tests (visual acuity, colour vision, and visual field), were consistent across all groups (20 mg, n = 69; 40 mg, n = 67; 80 mg, n = 71; placebo, n = 70). No clinically significant changes were observed between baseline and 12 weeks, except for an efficacy signal in contrast sensitivity for the sildenafil 40 mg group.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^11348tvt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse events in this study were similar between the treatment groups in both the double-blind and open-label portions. It was noted that treatment-related adverse events (AEs), in terms of both the number of AEs and patients reporting them, increased with the increasing dose of sildenafil. Sildenafil was generally well tolerated, with most AEs being mild or moderate in severity. Dyspnea was the most common AE reported across both study phases, while headache was the most common treatment-related AE. No patients were discontinued from the study due to abnormal laboratory test results, and there was no evidence of a dose-related increase in laboratory test abnormalities with an increasing dose of sildenafil.

### Management of sildenafil treatment failures [^114o1jcA]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to assess the management of sildenafil treatment failures. While oral type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for most cases of erectile dysfunction due to their high efficacy, ease of use, and acceptable safety profile, some patients fail to respond, primarily due to end-organ failure. This communication examines the management of sildenafil failures in light of recent advances.

Recent findings indicate that sildenafil failures may result from either a lack of efficacy or side effects, with issues potentially involving the physician, patient, and his partner. Physicians may play a role in sildenafil failure and discontinuation due to inadequate instructions, insufficient follow-up, suboptimal dosing, inadequate trial, or failure to adequately explain safety concerns. Studies have shown that the progression of endothelial dysfunction and a reduction in cavernosal smooth-muscle content are recognized organic factors leading to end-organ dysfunction and, ultimately, treatment failure.

In summary, proper counseling, medication optimization, and modification of associated risk factors can lead to success in men who initially failed sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction. Other treatment options to consider when sildenafil failure occurs include vacuum devices and intraurethral or intracavernosal administration of vasoactive drugs, either alone or combined with sildenafil. Penile prosthesis implantation is considered a last resort if all first-line and second-line therapies fail.

### Sildenafil for congenital heart diseases induced pulmonary hypertension, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112JcGzJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) is a family of enzymes present in a variety of organs, including blood vessels, corpus cavernosum, liver, and kidney, with more than eleven different families identified. PDEs control the activity of secondary messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Each specific family of PDE is targeted in treating selective diseases by acting on specific secondary messengers, such as PDEs 5, 6, and 9, which are selective for cGMP. When cGMP is hydrolyzed by PDE5, it triggers a cascade that establishes various cellular effects, including ion transport, endothelial permeability, and smooth muscle relaxation. PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) exert their effects by inhibiting PDE5-dependent cGMP hydrolysis, thereby increasing intracellular cGMP. As cGMP is the main secondary messenger for both nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide systems, its increase results in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and vasodilation.

Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, were first prescribed for angina pectoris and later proven effective in treating erectile dysfunction (ED). Cardiovascular diseases and ED share the same risk factors, including age, smoking, hypertension, depression, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions involve underlying pathophysiological mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction, inflammation of small blood vessels, and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Recently, several studies have elaborated on the cardioprotective efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors and proposed their usage in pulmonary arterial conditions.

### Sildenafil [^116BNcEj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypotension**: Sildenafil exhibits vasodilatory properties, leading to mild and transient decreases in blood pressure. Before prescribing sildenafil, it is crucial to carefully assess whether patients with certain underlying conditions could be adversely affected by these vasodilatory effects. This consideration is particularly important for patients on antihypertensive therapy, those with resting hypotension (blood pressure less than 90/50), fluid depletion, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, or autonomic dysfunction. It is advisable to monitor blood pressure when co-administering blood pressure-lowering drugs with sildenafil.

- **Worsening pulmonary vascular occlusive disease**: Pulmonary vasodilators may exacerbate the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Due to the lack of clinical data on sildenafil administration in patients with veno-occlusive disease, its use is not recommended in such cases. If signs of pulmonary edema occur following sildenafil administration, consider the possibility of associated PVOD.

- **Epistaxis**: In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD), the incidence of epistaxis was 13% among those taking sildenafil. This effect was not observed in patients with idiopathic PAH (sildenafil 3%, placebo 2%). Additionally, the incidence of epistaxis was higher in sildenafil-treated patients who were also on a concomitant oral vitamin K antagonist (9% vs. 2% in those not on a concomitant vitamin K antagonist). The safety of sildenafil in patients with bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration remains unknown.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering initiating monotherapy with a currently approved endothelin receptor antagonist, PDE5 inhibitor, or sGC stimulator in treatment-naive patients with PAH and WHO functional class II symptoms who are unwilling or unable to tolerate combination therapy:

- **Ambrisentan**: To improve 6MWD
- **Bosentan**: To delay time to clinical worsening
- **Macitentan**: To delay time to clinical worsening
- **Sildenafil**: To improve 6MWD
- **Tadalafil**: To improve 6MWD
- **Riociguat**: To improve 6MWD and WHO functional class, and to delay time to clinical worsening

### Sildenafil attenuates pulmonary arterial pressure but does not improve oxygenation during ARDS [^116bbMSQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a characteristic feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and contributes to mortality. Administration of sildenafil in ambulatory patients with pulmonary hypertension improves oxygenation and ameliorates pulmonary hypertension. Our aim was to determine whether sildenafil is beneficial for patients with ARDS.

- **Design**: Prospective, open-label, multicenter, interventional cohort study.
- **Setting**: Medical-surgical ICU of two university hospitals.
- **Patients**: Ten consecutive patients meeting the NAECC criteria for ARDS.
- **Interventions**: A single dose of 50 mg sildenafil citrate administered via a nasogastric tube.
- **Main results**: Administration of sildenafil in patients with ARDS decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 25 to 22 mmHg (P = 0.022) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 16 to 13 mmHg (P = 0.049). Systemic mean arterial pressures were markedly decreased from 81 to 75 mmHg (P = 0.005). Sildenafil did not improve pulmonary arterial oxygen tension, but resulted in a further increase in the shunt fraction.

Although sildenafil reduced pulmonary arterial pressures during ARDS, the increased shunt fraction and decreased arterial oxygenation render it unsuitable for the treatment of patients with ARDS.

### Oral versus intravenous sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension in neonates: a randomized trial [^1117VvYp]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study emphasizes the role of sildenafil in treating neonatal pulmonary hypertension in resource-poor settings. It demonstrates the benefits of both oral and intravenous administration routes for sildenafil in neonates. However, it advises close monitoring for hypotension and cardiac contractility when using the intravenous route. Further multicenter blind studies with larger sample sizes are required to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of the two administration methods for neonatal pulmonary hypertension.

### Oral sildenafil treatment for Eisenmenger syndrome: a prospective, open-label, multicentre study [^112BZfFi]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil has been shown to be safe and effective in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PAH related to connective tissue disease, its effects in Eisenmenger syndrome are less clear.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether long-term treatment (12 months) with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil improves clinical and haemodynamic parameters in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.

- **Design**: Prospective, open-label, multicentre study.

- **Setting**: Four pulmonary hypertension centres in China.

- **Patients**: 84 Eisenmenger syndrome functional class II-IV patients.

- **Interventions**: Oral sildenafil 20 mg orally three times a day.

- **Outcome measures**: 6-min walk distance (6MWD) test, resting systemic arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) in room air, haemodynamic parameters assessed by right heart catheterisation, safety and tolerability.

Results showed that the overall treatment effects at 12 months versus baseline (mean changes with 95% CIs) were a 56 m increase (42 to 69, p < 0.0001) in 6MWD, and a 2.4% increase (1.8% to 2.9%, p < 0.0001) in resting room air SaO(2). Improvements were also seen in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance index (-4.7 mm Hg (-7.5 to -1.9), p = 0.001; and -474 dyn×s×cm(-5)×m(2) (-634 to -314), p < 0.0001, respectively). Sildenafil was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild and transient, and occurred in the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Conclusions indicate that twelve months of oral sildenafil treatment was well tolerated and appeared to improve exercise capacity, systemic arterial oxygen saturation, and haemodynamic parameters in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.

### Sildenafil [^111GQbms]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of sildenafil, which is marketed for both pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and erectile dysfunction. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular events**: In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.

- **Nervous system**: Seizure and seizure recurrence have been reported.

- **Ophthalmologic**: Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Therapeutic challenges and emerging treatment targets for pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease [^1155zir1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In a study of patients with PH-LHD, sildenafil significantly improved PVR, cardiac output, 6-minute walk distance, and exercise capacity. In another study investigating patients with HFpEF with PH, sildenafil did not improve mPAP, PAWP, cardiac output, and peak oxygen consumption compared with placebo. In the SOVIAC (Sildenafil for Improving Outcomes after Valvular Correction) study, sildenafil was investigated in patients with PH-LHD who had undergone a successful mitral and/or aortic valve replacement or repair and had evidence of persistent precapillary PH after valvular surgery. Treatment with sildenafil resulted in significantly worse clinical outcomes, including death and HF hospitalization, compared with placebo.

Multiple meta-analyses have combined the results of studies evaluating the effects of various PDE5 inhibitors or sildenafil alone in PH-LHD. The results were consistent across the meta-analyses, with PDE5 inhibitors resulting in significant improvements in mPAP, PVR, LVEF, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with HFrEF, but not in patients with HFpEF. However, most studies that included patients with HFpEF had a relatively small sample size of this subset; therefore, more research is required to determine if PDE5 inhibitors benefit this group.

The studies showing benefit with PDE5 inhibitors included patients with HFrEF or HFpEF with right ventricular failure or both HFpEF and HFrEF. Patients with HFpEF without right ventricular failure did not appear to benefit despite the larger sample size. Right ventricular dysfunction is a predictor of poor outcomes in this patient population.

### Pulmonary vasodilation by sildenafil in acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism: a randomized explorative trial [^115e4hxd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

None of the patients reported adverse events. Blood pressure was lower in sildenafil-treated patients compared to placebo. The maximal drop in blood pressure was observed 120 minutes after administration of the study drug (sildenafil: -19 ± 10, placebo: 0 ± 9 mmHg, p = 0.0007) to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 91 ± 14 mmHg in the sildenafil group and 104 ± 10 mmHg in the placebo group. The largest drop in systemic blood pressure in a single patient was from 146/95 to 94/64 mmHg, observed 180 minutes after sildenafil treatment.

### Pulmonary vasodilation by sildenafil in acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism: a randomized explorative trial [^111qyg9i]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, we found that a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg lowered systemic blood pressure but did not improve cardiac index in patients with acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. The time from pulmonary embolism to intervention, a small patient sample size, and low pulmonary vascular resistance are limitations of this study that should be considered when interpreting the results.

### Addition of sildenafil to long-term intravenous epoprostenol therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: A randomized trial [^1178ybb3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). High credibility.

Oral sildenafil and intravenous epoprostenol have independently been shown to be effective in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of adding oral sildenafil to long-term intravenous epoprostenol in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

- **Design**: A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

- **Setting**: Multinational study at 41 centers in 11 countries from 3 July 2003 to 27 January 2006.

- **Patients**: 267 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (idiopathic, associated anorexigen use or connective tissue disease, or corrected congenital heart disease) who were receiving long-term intravenous epoprostenol therapy.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or sildenafil, 20 mg three times daily, titrated to 40 mg and 80 mg three times daily, as tolerated, at 4-week intervals. Of 265 patients who received treatment, 256 (97%) patients (123 in the placebo group and 133 in the sildenafil group) completed the study.

- **Measurements**: Change from baseline in exercise capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance (primary endpoint) and hemodynamic measurements, time to clinical worsening, and Borg dyspnea score (secondary endpoints).

- **Results**: A placebo-adjusted increase of 28.8 meters (95% CI, 13.9 to 43.8 meters) in the 6-minute walk distance occurred in patients in the sildenafil group; these improvements were most prominent among patients with baseline distances of 325 meters or more. Relative to epoprostenol monotherapy, addition of sildenafil resulted in a greater change.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^115gtdhZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan exerts its effects by inhibiting neprilysin and blocking the angiotensin II receptor 1. Neprilysin inhibition results in increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the second messenger involved in mediating natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and multiple other beneficial effects of the neprilysin substrates: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).

Sildenafil is a widely prescribed medicine for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary hypertension. It exerts its effects by increasing cGMP levels through inhibition of its degradation by phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). The recommended dose of sildenafil for the treatment of ED is 50 mg once daily, but may be increased to 100 mg for improved efficacy, if tolerated.

Since there is an overlap in the incidence of heart failure and ED, sildenafil may be coadministered with sacubitril/valsartan. Due to the involvement of a second messenger, cGMP, common to the mechanism of action of both medicines, this study investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction when sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil are coadministered. Since sacubitril/valsartan is administered daily but sildenafil is likely to be taken intermittently, the study was designed to investigate the potential for a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between sildenafil single dose and steady-state sacubitril/valsartan.

### Sildenafil for congenital heart diseases induced pulmonary hypertension, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115KNAdF]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Our manuscript is the most comprehensive meta-analysis done to date, including 14 studies with a total of 849 children, comparing the efficacy of using sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart diseases. Our meta-analysis showed a significant decrease favoring the sildenafil group in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), the pulmonary/systemic artery pressure ratio (PO/AO), mechanical ventilation duration, ICU stays, and hospital stays. However, there was an insignificant decrease in mean aortic pressure (mAOP) and mortality rates.

When compared to milrinone, sildenafil showed higher mPAP, PO/AO, sPAP, ICU stay, and hospital stay. Nevertheless, when compared to tadalafil, sildenafil showed lower mPAP, sPAP, PO/AO, mechanical ventilation time, and ICU stay, with no difference in mortality rates.

Studies not included in our analysis but present in our systematic review include Brast et al, who conducted the STARTS-1 and 2 randomized controlled trials. In STARTS-1, they compared the effect of sildenafil in several doses: low, medium, and high, administered orally three times daily for 16 weeks, versus placebo for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Congenital anomaly-induced hypertension was found in 39 out of 60 patients in the placebo group and 117 out of 174 patients in the sildenafil group. Overall, sildenafil was well tolerated for pediatric PAH with improved exercise capacity and hemodynamics, particularly with medium and high-dose sildenafil, with the overall profile favoring medium-dose sildenafil. In STARTS-2, a 3-year follow-up showed that all sildenafil dose groups exhibited satisfactory survival for children with PAH, although higher unexplored details were expected.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^116TQa4X]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

A decision was made during the design of this double-blind study and open-label extension not to conduct electroretinographic testing for several reasons. Firstly, preclinical studies involving two species showed no evidence of general ocular toxicity or specific retinal structural changes with long-term, high-dose sildenafil administration. Furthermore, results from a series of electroretinographic studies in humans receiving sildenafil are similarly reassuring, showing either no effect or modest, fully reversible, transient electroretinographic changes that do not translate into significant effects on visual performance. Finally, the risk of retinal toxicity seems to be exceedingly small, whereas the constraints and limitations of clinical electroretinographic testing at multiple sites are considerable. Transportation of these seriously ill patients to certified centers for electroretinographic testing would be necessary, and the underlying systemic disease and ocular manifestations could contribute to technical difficulties with the administration and interpretation of the test.

Several limitations to the study should be noted. Firstly, because ocular safety, including visual function, was not the primary objective of this phase III study, the sample size calculation was not based on ocular endpoints. We believe that the large amount of data available is generally sufficient for the assessment of ocular safety with sildenafil use in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, although the power to detect rare, serious events was lacking.

### Safety and efficacy of transition from subcutaneous treprostinil to oral sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116bP7db]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Sildenafil is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) and has been shown to improve 6-minute walk distance (SMWD) and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) and PAH associated with connective tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. Despite the efficacy of sildenafil in patients on conventional therapy with diuretics and anti-coagulants, little is known about the safety and efficacy of transitioning patients already established on parenteral prostanoid therapy to sildenafil.

- **Methods**: We studied 14 patients on long-term subcutaneous treprostinil for PAH (from a cohort of 51 patients [27%]), who wished to discontinue treatment because of injection-site pain. The etiology of their PAH included iPAH (7 of 14), PAH secondary to scleroderma (2 of 14), thromboembolic disease (3 of 14), and PAH post-surgical correction of ventricular septal defect (2 of 14). Treprostinil was gradually weaned, and all patients were started on an open-label regimen of 50 mg sildenafil four times per day for 3 months. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, SMWD, echocardiogram, and quality-of-life (QOL) measures were determined at baseline and after 3 months of therapy with sildenafil.

- **Results**: Of the 14 patients, 4 discontinued the transition because of deterioration during treprostinil withdrawal, despite the introduction of sildenafil. Replacement of chronic subcutaneous treprostinil with sildenafil was possible in 10 of 14 patients (71%) who demonstrated stable NYHA.

### Sildenafil attenuates pulmonary arterial pressure but does not improve oxygenation during ARDS [^114TerdT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Administration of sildenafil to patients with ARDS ameliorates pulmonary hypertension, thereby decreasing right ventricular afterload. However, it has deleterious effects on shunt fraction, oxygenation, and systemic blood pressure. In spite of the promising features of sildenafil found in preclinical studies, the results of this study do not justify a routine place for sildenafil in the treatment of ARDS patients. Whether sildenafil may be beneficial in ARDS patients with more severe pulmonary hypertension remains to be determined.

### Sildenafil for improving outcomes in patients with corrected valvular heart disease and persistent pulmonary hypertension: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^116e1UL3]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either sildenafil or placebo. Randomization was balanced using randomly permuted blocks of size four. Sites received the investigational product kits containing two bottles of 550 tablets of the study drug with the patient's treatment allocation codes. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment assignment. Active treatment was re-bottled sildenafil (20 mg Revatio tablets, Pfizer), whereas the placebo manufacturing process ensured identical appearance to the active drug [see Supplementary Material S1].

In patients in whom recent catheterization data was unavailable (88 patients, 44%) but showed a systolic pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 50 mmHg in a screening echocardiographic study, a per-protocol right-heart catheterization procedure was performed. An acute vasoreactivity test with open-label sublingual sildenafil (100 mg) was performed for patients undergoing per-protocol catheterization. For patients who underwent catheterization prior to enrolment, vasoreactivity results were registered retrospectively whenever available. The diastolic and mean transpulmonary pressure gradients were calculated by subtracting the mean pulmonary wedge pressure from the diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures, respectively.

Although the recommended dose of sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension is 20 mg three times daily (t.i.d.), most clinical trials of sildenafil in LHD-PH have used higher doses. Accordingly, we chose a target study dose of 40 mg orally t.i.d.

### Caution is recommended prior to sildenafil use in vascular anomalies [^112W8RBy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Since the publication of a single case report of lymphatic malformation improvement during sildenafil therapy for pulmonary hypertension, sildenafil use has propagated across multiple vascular anomalies diagnoses. Vascular anomalies are rare conditions, often with poor long-term outcomes from available therapies, making these patients vulnerable to novel therapy use. We have retrospectively reviewed 14 children with vascular anomalies treated with sildenafil. None of these patients reported improvement of disease while on treatment, and some reported side effects including infections and bleeding. Pending more convincing prospective data, we recommend caution prior to sildenafil use for vascular anomalies.

### Chronic sildenafil treatment corrects endothelial dysfunction and improves hypertension [^113Vyxws]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Nitric oxide (NO) availability plays a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure, endothelial function, and arterial structure. Many of the biological actions of NO are mediated by 3'5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is rapidly degraded by cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Although short-term cardiovascular effects of PDE inhibitors have been studied, the changes resulting from their chronic administration in hypertension have not been evaluated. We investigated whether retarding the degradation of cGMP by long-term inhibition of PDE-5 would have beneficial consequences in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a commonly used experimental model of human essential hypertension.

- **Methods**: Subgroups of hypertensive 13-week-old male SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with sildenafil, 2.5 mg/kg/day, or vehicle, by gastric gavage for 6 months.

- **Results**: As expected, the untreated SHR had endothelial dysfunction and a steady increment of blood pressure. In contrast, chronic sildenafil administration reversed endothelial dysfunction, reduced renal oxidative stress and renal macrophage accumulation, and ameliorated the severity of hypertension in SHR.

- **Conclusions**: These results demonstrate beneficial effects of long-term PDE-5 inhibition in SHR and suggest that its use as an adjunct therapy in essential hypertension should be investigated.
