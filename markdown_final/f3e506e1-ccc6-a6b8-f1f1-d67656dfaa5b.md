## Question

Is there a comparable drug to hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SLE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a comparable drug to hydroxychloroquine for treating systemic lupus erythematosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "comparable" should mean in guideline-based SLE care. Then, I should verify which agents are truly in the same antimalarial class and how guidelines position them. Next, I will examine head-to-head or substitution evidence and safety trade-offs. After that, I should review non-antimalarial alternatives that are used when HCQ is insufficient or contraindicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit answer with dosing and monitoring considerations, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the benchmark: hydroxychloroquine is the anchor therapy for essentially all patients with SLE unless contraindicated, with strong recommendations from ACR and EULAR to initiate and continue HCQ long term, given its broad benefits including reduced flares, less organ damage, improved survival, and favorable pregnancy safety, so any "comparable" agent would need to approximate that disease-modifying profile and guideline endorsement [^115oocWc] [^116gw8dg] [^113XSVH9].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic class. HCQ is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial; the closest true class alternatives are chloroquine and quinacrine, with guidelines explicitly positioning them as antimalarial options for SLE, particularly when HCQ is not tolerated or for refractory cutaneous disease, though they are not identical in retinal toxicity risk or availability [^1164rVY4] [^115ubUfU].

> I will now examine chloroquine as a direct substitute. Guidelines allow switching to chloroquine for persistent cutaneous lupus despite HCQ, but they caution that chloroquine carries a higher retinopathy risk than HCQ and requires more frequent retinal monitoring, so it is a reasonable alternative when HCQ fails or is not tolerated, yet it is not a perfect equivalent in safety or convenience [^1164rVY4] [^113nV9KM].

> Next, I should review quinacrine. Quinacrine is often added to HCQ or used when HCQ is contraindicated or causes toxicity; importantly, it does not cause retinopathy, which is a major advantage, but it is not FDA-approved in the U.S. and must be obtained through compounding pharmacies, and it is especially useful for refractory cutaneous lupus, so it is a valuable alternative rather than a universal substitute for HCQ [^1164rVY4] [^113nV9KM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-antimalarial agents being "comparable". Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and biologics like belimumab and anifrolumab are used when HCQ alone is insufficient or as steroid-sparing agents, but they do not replicate HCQ's unique combination of antithrombotic, metabolic, pregnancy-compatible, and broad disease-modifying effects, so they are complements or substitutes for specific indications rather than true equivalents to HCQ [^111N1S1s] [^114mFqgK] [^113XSVH9].

> Let me consider dosing and safety nuances that affect comparability. Contemporary guidance targets HCQ at or below 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight to mitigate retinopathy, with some data suggesting higher flare risk at strictly ≤ 5 mg/kg/day; this dose–response tension underscores why alternatives like quinacrine or carefully selected chloroquine may be needed when toxicity risk is high or efficacy seems limited at lower HCQ doses, reinforcing that "comparable" must balance benefit, toxicity, and monitoring burden [^115oocWc] [^1154sACr] [^1164rVY4].

> I should double-check the bottom line. There is no single drug with identical efficacy, safety, accessibility, and guideline endorsement that fully replaces HCQ across all SLE scenarios; chloroquine and quinacrine are the most comparable antimalarial alternatives for selected patients, while methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and biologics are used for disease control when HCQ is inadequate or contraindicated, but none matches HCQ's breadth of benefits and foundational role in SLE management [^115oocWc] [^116gw8dg] [^112KtaWP].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is specifically about cutaneous lupus that persists despite HCQ? In that narrower context, adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine is conditionally recommended over escalating to systemic immunosuppressants, which is where the concept of "comparable" is most actionable and evidence-aligned for refractory skin disease [^1164rVY4] [^113nV9KM].

> Final synthesis: there is no perfect substitute for hydroxychloroquine in SLE. Chloroquine and quinacrine are the closest class alternatives with distinct toxicity and access considerations, and non-antimalarial immunosuppressants or biologics are used for broader disease control when HCQ is insufficient, so treatment should be individualized and anchored in shared decision-making and guideline-concordant monitoring rather than seeking a one-to-one replacement for HCQ [^115oocWc] [^116gw8dg] [^112KtaWP].

There is **no direct substitute** for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in SLE that matches its broad efficacy, safety, and guideline-backed status [^115oocWc]. Chloroquine is the **closest alternative** within the antimalarial class but has a higher retinopathy risk and is less favored [^1164rVY4]. Quinacrine can be added or used when HCQ is contraindicated, especially for refractory cutaneous disease, but it is not a standalone substitute [^1164rVY4]. Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and biologics (belimumab, anifrolumab) are used when HCQ is insufficient or contraindicated, yet none replicate HCQ's unique benefits [^111N1S1s] [^114mFqgK]. If HCQ must be stopped, combine alternatives and tailor therapy to disease manifestations, with close monitoring for flares [^1164rVY4] [^114Kbp9Y].

## Pharmacological alternatives to hydroxychloroquine

### Antimalarial agents

- **Chloroquine**: Closely related to HCQ, it shares immunomodulatory properties but has a higher risk of retinopathy; use is limited and requires stricter ophthalmologic monitoring [^1164rVY4].

- **Quinacrine (mepacrine)**: Often added to HCQ for refractory cutaneous lupus; it does not cause retinopathy but can cause yellow skin discoloration and gastrointestinal upset [^1164rVY4].

---

### Immunosuppressive agents

- **Methotrexate**: Effective for arthritis and cutaneous manifestations; often used when HCQ is insufficient or contraindicated [^111N1S1s].

- **Azathioprine**: Useful for moderate disease, including hematologic and musculoskeletal involvement; steroid-sparing [^111N1S1s].

- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: Preferred for lupus nephritis and moderate-to-severe disease; potent immunosuppression with teratogenic risk [^111N1S1s].

---

### Biologic therapies

- **Belimumab**: Targets B-cell activating factor (BAFF); approved for active SLE and lupus nephritis, particularly when standard therapy is inadequate [^114mFqgK].

- **Anifrolumab**: Type I interferon receptor antagonist; approved for moderate-to-severe SLE with active disease despite standard therapy [^114mFqgK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting alternatives

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Chloroquine | Cutaneous lupus | Moderate | Non-inferior to methotrexate for complete response; higher retinopathy risk [^113oERsm] |
| Quinacrine | Refractory cutaneous lupus | Low | Effective add-on to HCQ; no retinopathy [^1164rVY4] |
| Methotrexate | Arthritis, cutaneous disease | Moderate | Effective steroid-sparing agent [^111N1S1s] |
| Azathioprine | Moderate disease | Moderate | Steroid-sparing; useful in pregnancy [^111N1S1s] |
| Mycophenolate | Lupus nephritis, moderate disease | High | Superior to azathioprine in LN; effective in non-renal SLE [^115vh3Q8] |
| Belimumab | Active SLE, lupus nephritis | High | Reduces flares; steroid-sparing [^notfound] |
| Anifrolumab | Moderate-to-severe SLE | High | Reduces disease activity; steroid-sparing [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and risks of alternatives

- **Chloroquine**: Higher retinopathy risk; requires frequent ophthalmologic monitoring [^1164rVY4].

- **Quinacrine**: Limited availability; yellow discoloration; gastrointestinal side effects [^1164rVY4].

- **Immunosuppressants**: Increased infection risk, hematologic toxicity, hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity (mycophenolate) [^notfound].

- **Biologics**: High cost; infusion reactions; infection risk; long-term safety data still evolving [^117VwMEK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

ACR and EULAR recommend **HCQ for all patients unless contraindicated** [^115oocWc] [^116gw8dg]. If HCQ is not tolerated or ineffective, **add or switch to methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate** based on disease manifestations [^111N1S1s]. For refractory disease, **add belimumab or anifrolumab** [^114mFqgK]. In cutaneous lupus, **consider adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine** if HCQ fails [^1164rVY4].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring alternatives

- **HCQ contraindications**: Retinopathy, G6PD deficiency, severe hypersensitivity.

- **HCQ intolerance**: Gastrointestinal upset, dermatologic reactions.

- **Inadequate response**: Persistent disease activity despite optimal HCQ use.

- **Patient preference**: Concerns about retinopathy or other adverse effects.

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Regular **ophthalmologic exams** are essential for chloroquine and HCQ [^115rRyxc]. Monitor CBC, LFTs, and renal function for immunosuppressants [^notfound]. Screen for infections and malignancy with biologics. Counsel on teratogenicity and contraception for mycophenolate and methotrexate [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **no perfect substitute** for HCQ in SLE; chloroquine and quinacrine are the closest antimalarial options, while immunosuppressants and biologics address specific manifestations but do not replicate HCQ's broad benefits [^115oocWc]. Management should be individualized, balancing efficacy, safety, and patient preferences, with close monitoring for disease flares and adverse effects [^1172pYGU].

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

Team members have prospectively followed cohorts > 3700 adult SLE patients with collected and harmonized data on demographics and clinical factors. Team members are founding members of CAN-AIM CIHR-funded Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network team. Patients identified as having lowered HCQ dose will form sub-cohort for time-to-event analyses. Investigators will evaluate only first-ever lowering of HCQ. Analysis will evaluate patients from time zero to assess combined outcome of earliest of a) increase in SLEDAI-2K of at least 4 points and/or b) hospitalization for SLE and/or c) augmented SLE therapy defined as increase in HCQ or new start or increase in corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant. In addition to accepted minimal clinically significant SLEDAI-2K change investigators include drug changes and SLE-related hospitalizations.

Patients studied in Objective 1 will be right censored if HCQ is discontinued completely; these will enter into analyses for Objective 2. Otherwise patients will be followed until outcome of interest or end of study. D POWER/SAMPLE CALCULATIONS D1 Power calculations for multivariate models Combined cohorts include over 3300 patients have exposed to HCQ. Patients have had lowering of dose 45% or discontinuation of HCQ during their follow-up. Power calculations are based on available data suggesting that 45%-60% of SLE patients may flare over ten years of follow-up.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

Hydroxychloroquine: anchor drug, but more caution may be needed

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is rightfully considered as the mainstay of SLE treatment due to its multifaceted beneficial effects and despite the paucity of randomised evidence. Indeed, use of HCQ has been consistently associated with favourable responses in 'hard' disease outcomes, like irreversible damage and even mortality, as well as with other disease aspects, ranging from prevention of congenital heart blockto improved metabolic and lipid profile(figure 1). Therefore, the focus has recently switched to more 'practical' questions regarding adherence to treatment and, furthermore, the relationship between HCQ blood concentrations ([HCQ]) and disease course. Compliance to treatment has been shown in several observational studies to be suboptimal; complete non-adherence rates (ie, undetectable blood levels of HCQ) range from 7% to 29%, while a recent Chinese study in 276 patients with SLE reported subtherapeutic levels in 77% of patients. Nevertheless, data regarding the association between lower blood concentrations and worse disease outcome have been less robust; certain studies have shown lower disease activity in patients with higher concentrations, while others have not. The Plaquenil LUpus Systemic (PLUS) randomised study failed to show difference in flare prevention between patients receiving [HCQ]-adjusted dosing versus stable dose, although the results were 'blurred' by the spontaneous increase in [HCQ] in both patient groups just prior to randomisation, owing to better 'last-minute' adherence.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^114cmXEL]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by bouts of immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the main drug used to treat lupus; HCQ has been shown to reduce flaresand confer a protective effect on survival. Additionally, HCQ use is associated with reduced frequency and severity of organ damage. Recent data show that HCQ reduces SLE flares by 57% and disease activity by 32%.HCQ is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug due to its ability to alter 'antigen-processing' by antigen-presenting cells. This is thought to decrease SLE activity at a molecular level and has direct anti-inflammatory effects.

HCQ is generally a well-tolerated drug. That said, HCQ use is linked to a number of adverse effects, which may be broadly classified by severity. While more common, gastrointestinal distress, aquagenic pruritus and other dermatological complaints rarely necessitate discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, retinal, neuromuscular and cardiac effects usually dictate withdrawal and are occasionally irreversible.

Figure 1
The multiple therapeutic benefits of hydroxychloroquine in lupus.

To further complicate matters, the recent development of advanced, more sensitive screening techniques for the detection of HCQ-induced retinal toxicity (eg, 10–2 visual fields, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography) suggests that the latter may be more prevalent than previously believed, reaching 10% or more among long-term users. A daily dose of > 5 mg/kg real weight and a duration of use of more than 5 and, especially, more than 10 years, are particularly associated with heightened risk of retinal toxicity. Patients with chronic kidney disease and pre-existing retinal or macular abnormalities comprise a particularly high-risk group. Considering that, (1) recent data were based on prescription practices rather than actual blood concentrations, (2) drug adherence rates are consistently suboptimal in all studies, and (3) SLE is a chronic disease affecting predominantly young individuals, one could be concerned that physician efforts to improve patient compliance rates in the future may have to come at the expense of increased ocular toxicity.

Where do the above data leave us? Undoubtedly, HCQ is indispensable for the treatment of SLE, but a certain degree of caution is needed. The recommended daily dose should not exceed 5 mg/kg real body weight and periodic eye examination (baseline, after 5 years and yearly thereafter, in the absence of retinal findings) should no more be performed by funduscopy, rather by one of the newer screening techniques recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Of note, the comparative efficacy of lower HCQ doses in terms of disease control and prevention of relapses will have to be tested in practice, as all published trials have used the previously common 6.5 mg/kg target dose. In our practice, we also attempt to reduce to a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day in patients with persistent low disease activity (LDA) or remission, although no robust data exist to substantiate this practice. Measuring HCQ concentrations can be helpful to detect complete non-adherence, but more data are needed regarding concentration-adjusted dosing, owing also to its limited availability. Finally, especially in patients with skin manifestations, quinacrine may be used as an alternative antimalarial, given its reported efficacy in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Clinical Question

What is the efficacy of interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs)?

Bottom Line

Available RCT evidence on the management of cutaneous disease in SLE is sparse and of limited quality. Among traditional options, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine have the strongest evidence compared with placebo in the end points of complete clinical response and number of clinical flares, respectively, while chloroquine appears noninferior to methotrexate in achieving complete clinical response.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^116pSsPV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course involving multiple organs and requiring different and dynamic treatments. Treatment guidelines have been updated over time as more evidence on treatment effectiveness and safety has accumulated. Acknowledging the increased risk of organ damage associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC), the 2019 update of EULAR guidelines recommended a maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone-equivalent GC, which was recently updated to a maximum of 5 mg. In general, GC should only be used during periods of increased disease activity and, when possible, be reduced or discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is recommended for all patients with SLE, considering the individual's risk for flares and retinal toxicity. However, it is not well understood to what extent new guidelines have led to changes in SLE treatment in practice. Immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biologic agents are also important options to be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation.

SLE poses formidable therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneity and treatment decisions often cannot be guided by data of high quality. In this review, we attempt to provide insights regarding the treatment of SLE in everyday clinical practice, based on contemporary evidence and our own personal experience. We focus on common therapeutic issues and dilemmas arising in routine care, including monitoring for retinal toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine, handling of glucocorticoid regimens in order to minimise their adverse events, choice of immunosuppressive medications based on prevailing disease manifestations and optimal use of available biological agents (belimumab and rituximab). We also provide our view on the position of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lupus nephritis and conclude with remarks on the future perspectives for this challenging disease.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1139bC5B]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease of multifactorial aetiology and with an unpredictable course. It can be characterised by the occurrence of flares, eventually leading to organ damage and an impaired quality of life.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), inexpensive and well-tolerated antimalarial drug, is now one of the most important medications for SLE, showing multiple benefits over several outcomes associated with the disease itself, as controlling disease activity, preventing flares and damage accrual, but also to its related comorbidities.HCQ binds strongly to melanin and can deposit in melanin-containing tissues such as the skin and the eyes, which might explain some side effects like retinopathy or skin hyperpigmentation.

Currently, HCQ is prescribed according to body weight. The recommended daily dosage of HCQ has varied during the years. The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations stated that the safe daily dose of HCQ is no more than 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day in SLE to decrease retinopathy occurrence. The current 2020 Joint Statement on HCQ and the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines confirmed the ophthalmological recommendations. An important concern with the current guidelines is that the efficacy of the recently recommended maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day of real body weight) has not been evaluated for patients with SLE. Many past studies evaluating the efficacy of HCQ considered a dosage of at least 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day and it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose would be effective in controlling the disease. Moreover, this dosage is based on data from patients who effectively collected their medication. Unfortunately, less than half of the patients are taking HCQ as prescribed. Adherence to HCQ treatment is an unmet need in SLE, particularly for younger patients who may concern about adverse effects such as of retinopathy. Although non-adherence is an important issue, over two-thirds of rheumatologists are unaware of HCQ non-adherence. Low adherence rates to HCQ, if combined with a lower prescribed dose, may potentially lead to HCQ undertreatment.

Systemic lupus erythematosus guideline discussion — In this guideline, we recommend HCQ, limiting glucocorticoid exposure, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing medication toxicity for all people with SLE. Many recommendations are conditional and do not specify one particular immunosuppressive agent, or even one class of agent, and the guideline strongly emphasizes the role of shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Routine assessment of medication adherence is suggested.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^117BCmRr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

Objectives

Patients with features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who do not fulfill classification criteria can be designated as incomplete lupus (ILE). This condition includes individuals with a high risk of progression to SLE. Treatment of ILE may reduce symptoms, severity and incidence of SLE.

Methods

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was chosen as an ILE intervention for a randomized, double-blind trial to determine whether rate of accumulation of SLE features defined by the 2012 SLICC criteria could be reduced. ILE was defined as ANA positivity with 1–2 additional criteria. Patients 15–49 years old were eligible. Randomization was 1:1 HCQ to placebo. Evaluations were at 3-month intervals over 24 months. Meeting SLICC classification sooner required exit.

Results

Participants (n = 187) were randomized at 7 sites. After excluding 7 patients who met SLE classification at baseline when screening laboratory data were completed, 180 patients were analyzed: 92 on HCQ and 88 on placebo. The mean age was 33 years, 91.1% were female and 74.4% were white. SLE classification developed in 24 (13.3%); another 24 developed additional criteria but did not meet classification. The rates of acquisition of SLICC criteria and progression to SLE were similar in the two groups (P = 0.72 and P = 0.98, respectively). Development of SLE was associated with new malar rash, oral ulcers, joint tenderness or pleurisy (P < 0.04).

Conclusion

While SMILE did not show effects of HCQ on ILE progression, the results offer insights into SLE risk in the ILE population. With development of biomarkers, designing targeted prevention strategies should be feasible.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus [^111Y95tj]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs predominantly in young women, but also in children. The prevalence of SLE varies widely worldwide, ranging from about 1 in 3500 women (regardless of race) in the UK, to 1 in 1000 women in China, to 1 in 250 black women in the USA.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments on joint (arthralgia/arthritis) symptoms and other non-organ-threatening symptoms such as serositis and fatigue in people with systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the effects of interventions for cutaneous involvement in people with systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the effects of treatments in people with proliferative (WHO grades 3–5) lupus nephritis? What are the effects of treatments for neuropsychiatric involvement in people with systemic lupus nephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found eight systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acitretin, antipsychotic drugs, chloroquine, combination corticosteroids plus immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, intravenous immunoglobulin, methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, plasmapheresis, and sun block.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: a review [^112KtaWP]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and immune-mediated injury to multiple organ systems, including the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Approximately 3.4 million people worldwide have received a diagnosis of SLE.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with SLE are female. Although there are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria for SLE, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly the European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria developed for scientific study are an estimated 96.1% sensitive and 93.4% specific for SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels. Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard of care for SLE and has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Treatments in addition to hydroxychloroquine are individualized, with immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide, typically used for treating moderate to severe disease. Three SLE medications were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration: belimumab (for active SLE in 2011 and for lupus nephritis in 2020), voclosporin (for lupus nephritis), and anifrolumab (for active SLE).

Conclusions and Relevance

Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with immune-mediated damage to multiple organs and increased mortality. Hydroxychloroquine is first-line therapy and reduces disease activity, morbidity, and mortality. When needed, additional immunosuppressive and biologic therapies include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^111WkH7h]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cornerstone medication for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and sustained HCQ use might greatly reduce disease flares. However, there is concern over retinal toxicity, an irreversible complication that may affect 20% of patients after long‐term exposure. Uncertainties about the relative risks/benefits of long‐term treatment are a primary concern voiced by patients with SLE, and almost one‐third of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ treatment by 5–8 years.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Although some patients may do well after reducing therapy, others will have potentially life‐threatening complications related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares, and there is no information available to guide individual decision‐making.
Three cohorts of patients with SLE who were tapering, stopping, or maintaining hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were evaluated. The crude flare rate was significantly lower in patients maintaining HCQ therapy than in those tapering or discontinuing the drug.
Non‐White patients (especially Black, Asian, or First Nations patients), those age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis, and those with active disease, including patients receiving prednisone or immunosuppressors, are at higher risk of having flares.
Our results suggest caution in tapering or discontinuation of HCQ in some groups of patients with SLE. The identification of these predictors is an important approach to promote personalized medicine to avoid unnecessary toxicities, as well as to monitor for flares in situations such as the current setting of potential HCQ shortages due to interest in this drug as a therapy for COVID‐19.

On an individual level, patients with SLE and clinicians struggle with many treatment decisions, since there is little information available on tapering or stopping HCQ to guide individual decision‐making. Some patients may do well after HCQ withdrawal, but others will have potentially life‐threatening complications. Recently, new concerns have arisen regarding HCQ shortages for patients with SLE due to potential COVID‐19 treatment. Clearly, we need better predictors of flare risk after HCQ is lowered or discontinued. The aim of this study was to identify baseline factors associated with a poor outcome once HCQ is tapered or discontinued in SLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113Vu3Jh]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, measurement of HCQ in whole blood was proposed to help clinicians distinguish non-adherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ and eventually adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability. Several studies underline a significant role for routine monitoring of HCQ levels as a measure of non-adherence.

Despite this finding, there is insufficient information on the overall clinical impact of incorporating routine testing of HCQ blood levels and potential benefits of individualising HCQ doses.

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess if the HCQ dose influenced the risk of SLE flare (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg per day or greater than 5 mg/kg per day). As a secondary analysis, we aimed to: (1) compare HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and (2) evaluate the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

### Treat to target in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1115Hst4]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat-to-target principle of controlling inflammatory disease activity by means of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or immunosuppressive drugs also pertains to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, in SLE, intensifying immunosuppression with higher-dose glucocorticoids may worsen outcomes. Therefore, all current recommendations favor better disease control while limiting daily glucocorticoid doses to a maximum of 5 or 7.5 mg of prednisolone daily. Hydroxychloroquine and other prophylactic measures are added, and antiphospholipid syndrome is treated with anticoagulation and not with immunosuppression, which makes the approach of treat to target slightly more complex, mirroring the complexity of the disease.

### Generating evidence to inform health technology assessment of treatments for SLE: a systematic review of decision-analytic model-based economic evaluations [^1177JU22]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a complex autoimmune disease that can affect many systems of the body and is characterised by an extremely heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. The estimated prevalence of SLE is low, relative to other autoimmune diseases, and variable between countries. People with SLE experience an uncertain trajectory of health outcomes that may comprise photosensitive skin rashes, fatigue, anaemia, neuropsychiatric manifestations and involvement of the pulmonary, cardiac and renal organ systems. Lupus nephritis occurs in up to 60% of people with SLE and may lead to end-stage renal disease.SLE is associated with higher mortality and lower quality of life compared with the general population.

SLE is managed by rheumatologists and other specialists including nephrologists and dermatologists. The objective(s) of treatment are to reduce disease activity and prevent irreversible organ damage. The presentation of multifaceted symptoms and the imperfect criteria for diagnosis may increase the time to confirm a case of SLE in routine clinical practice. The development of treatments for SLE has been characterised by a landscape of clinical trials that failed to reach their primary end point due to, for example, the inclusion of patients without active disease, the influence of background concomitant therapies and the use of instruments that were insensitive to detect response to treatment. As a result, approved therapeutic alternatives for SLE are limited, encompassing off-label and licenced agents, and their use is subject to regional variation. Treatments comprise glucocorticoids to control inflammation in the short term, antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressive therapies such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and newer biologic agents such as intravenous rituximab and belimumab.

### Desensitization to hydroxychloroquine – experience of 4 patients [^115aoCB6]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial agent with immunomodulatory effects. It is widely used in rheumatologic diseases, and has a very high efficacy/toxicity ratio. It is particularly important in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) since it reduces new organ involvement and disease flares, and relieves skin and joint symptoms. Some patients develop hypersensitivity rash in response to HCQ. In such patients the drug is withdrawn and replaced by another medication. All the alternative medications for rheumatological patients are significantly more toxic than HCQ. We describe our initial experience of HCQ slow oral desensitization. All 4 patients who were recruited completed the procedure successfully without significant difficulty. Our results suggest that HCQ slow oral desensitization is safe, effective, and easy to perform.

Hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/lupus nephritis (LN) — implementation, dosing, monitoring, and adjunctive-therapy practice point are detailed. Because of hemolysis risk in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, measurement of G6PD levels is preferred in men before starting hydroxychloroquine, and all patients should have a baseline retinal examination with annual eye testing, especially after 5 years of use; clinicians should be aware antimalarials may be cardiotoxic. The dosing of hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg ideal weight or 400 mg/d and, during maintenance, should be lowered to 4 to 5 mg/kg/d. Data from multiple observational cohorts show reduced flare and organ damage accrual and a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects, including ocular toxicity, providing the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states adjunctive therapies to manage LN and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients.

Results

Demographic and clinical profile at diagnosis

Three patients did not receive HCQ within the study period (one who refused to take the drug, one with a hereditary degenerative retinal condition who was treated with mepacrine instead and one in whom HCQ was not prescribed) and one patient died before the fifth year of follow-up. Therefore, 150 patients (97.4% of the inception cohort with at least 5 years of follow-up) were included. The baseline SLEDAI was similar across the four-time slots for SLE diagnosis (p = 0.8).

The main demographic, clinical and therapeutic variables are summarised in table 1.

### Hydroxychloroquine is associated with lower platelet activity and improved vascular health in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112RQpWb]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease characterised by a wide array of symptoms that can affect virtually all organ systems. The antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the most frequently prescribed long-term medication used to treat this disease, a practice driven by extensive literature supporting its benefits in patients with SLE. Notably, HCQ has been associated with several benefits in patients with SLE, including a decrease in the rate of disease flares, protection against organ damage, improvement in overall survivaland reduction in the risk of thrombosis. Although antithrombotic effects have been demonstrated in clinical studies, the underlying mechanisms driving this protective effect are not fully understood. Accordingly, we compared platelet phenotypes and measures of vascular health in patients with SLE who were and were not prescribed HCQ to define the cardiovascular effects of this therapy in SLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: how much is enough? [^116nmS3W]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results support this hypothesis. Most patients on stable doses of 200 mg/day (or 3.0–3.5 mg/kg/day) remained well-controlled long term with maintenance doses of prednisone ≤ 2.5 mg/day, combined, if needed with IS and/or mepacrine. Weight-adjusted doses of HCQ did not differ between patients with different baseline activities or achieving or not prolonged remission. The doses of HCQ were stable in our unit across the 17 years of entering the cohort; in fact, most patients included in our previous studies showed the beneficial effects of HCQ on survival, thrombosis and cardiovascular damage, cancer and infectionswere receiving 200 mg/day. As expected, ocular toxicity has not been observed in patients treated with HCQ for more than 11 years. Indeed, preserving long-term therapy with HCQ is crucial to assure its many beneficial effects beyond the control of SLE activity. For that, avoiding toxicity is the major goal.

Our main limitation is that we could not compare the clinical course of patients treated with doses lower and higher than 200 mg/day or 5 mg/kg/day. However, our remission rates can be compared favourably with patients from other groups receiving 400 mg/day. No differences in the dose of HCQ were found among patients who received additional drugs. Also, most of our patients were white and non-obese; while no relevant differences have been found in the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials regarding race, black patients may present with more severe forms of disease. In addition, obesity may influence the body distribution of HCQ.

In conclusion, with the use of HCQ at stable doses of 200 mg/day (or 3.0–3.5 mg/kg/day) as the background therapy, more than 70% of inception patients with SLE in our cohort achieved prolonged remission. While data on the safety of such doses are solid, our results also substantiate their efficacy, however, comparative studies of stable doses of 200 versus 400 mg/day of HCQ would be needed to confirm our findings.

HCQ dosing

HCQ-related variables are summarised in table 2. The mean (SD) starting dose of HCQ was 206 mg/day (37.0), 96% of patients taking 200 mg/day. The starting dose of HCQ did not differ across the four-time slots (year 2001–2005, 206 mg/day; year 2006–2010, 202 mg/day; year 2011–2015, 211 mg/day; year 2016–2018, 200 mg/day; p = 0.7).

Table 2
Hydroxychloroquine therapy in the whole cohort and by SLEDAI groups

The mean (SD) dose of HCQ during the 5-year follow-up was 194.6 mg/day (35.8). Only three patients (2%) received HCQ > 300 mg/day (309, 316 and 395 mg/day, respectively). The mean (SD) weight-adjusted HCQ dose during the follow-up was 2.9 mg/kg/day (0.8). 99% received < 5 mg/kg/day. All HCQ-related variables did not differ across the three baseline SLEDAI groups.

The mean (SD) weight-adjusted starting dose of HCQ was 3.1 mg/kg/day (0.8) with 98% of patients receiving ≤ 4.5 mg/kg/day. No patients were treated with doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. The mean weight-adjusted starting dose of HCQ was similar in all subgroups (year 2001–2005, 3.2 mg/kg/day; year 2006–2010, 3 mg/kg/day; year 2011–2016, 3.2 mg/kg/day; year 2016–2018, 3.1 mg/kg/day) and across baseline activity groups. Such doses remained substantially unchanged during the 5-year follow-up (table 3).

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: how much is enough? [^115p6Ksu]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the daily and weight-adjusted dosages of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the effects on long-term remission in the Lupus-Cruces cohort.

Methods

Observational study of routine clinical care data. We selected inception patients treated with HCQ with at least 5 years of follow-up. Prolonged remission was achieved when patients fulfilled deﬁnitions of remission in systemic lupus erythematosus remission criteria in five consecutive yearly visits. The associations between the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ during 5 years and prolonged remission were analysed. We also investigated the associations between prednisone doses, immunosuppressives (IS) and other antimalarial use with HCQ doses.

Results

150 inception patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean starting dose of HCQ was 206mg/day. The mean weight-adjusted starting dose of HCQ was 3.1mg/kg/day with no patients treated with doses ≥ 5mg/kg/day. Treatment with HCQ was maintained during the whole 5-year follow-up time in 147 patients (98%). The mean dose of HCQ during the 5-year follow-up was 194.6mg/day (2.9mg/kg/day). 108 patients (72%) were in prolonged remission. The mean weight-adjusted dose of HCQ per patient did not differ between those who did and did not achieve prolonged remission (2.9 vs 3mg/kg/day, p = 0.5). The dose of prednisone per patient (mean 2.3mg/day during the 5-year follow-up) did not differ according to the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ. The mean weight-adjusted HCQ dose during the whole follow-up was the same in patients treated or not with IS or with mepacrine.

Conclusions

With the use of HCQ at stable doses of 200mg/day (or 3.0–3.5mg/kg/day) as the background therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the majority of patients achieved prolonged remission.

### Clinical impact of hydroxychloroquine dose adjustment according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines in systemic lupus erythematosus [^111jUZhY]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by a disruptive innate and adaptive immunity requiring immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug with immunomodulatory properties, remains one of the most important drugs in SLE. Multiple studies have demonstrated its favourable effects in SLE, such as reducing disease exacerbations, damage accrual and mortality. Despite its several therapeutic benefits, HCQ-induced retinal toxicity remains a major concern. This adverse event is reported to be below 1% during the first 5 years of drug treatment, but increases to 2% during the next 5 years and up to 20% after 20 years of therapy. For this reason, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended guidelines regarding the screening and risks of retinal toxicity. Previously, the AAO recommended HCQ dose ≤ 6.5 mg/kg/day (ideal body weight) to reduce the risk of retinal toxicity, but in the revised guidelines of 2016 the safety dose was changed to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day (actual body weight). However, it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose has a significant impact on the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with SLE and whether or not this dose reduction would be effective in controlling the disease. Therefore, we examined the effect of HCQ dose adjustment to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day on the clinical outcomes of a cohort of Puerto Ricans with SLE.

### The role of antimalarial agents in the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis [^114KaMrv]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that affects various organs. Lupus nephritis is one of the most common, and most important, serious manifestations of SLE. Antimalarial agents are part of the immunomodulatory regimen used to treat patients with SLE; however, their role in the treatment of patients with lupus nephritis in particular is less well recognized, especially by nephrologists. Not all antimalarial agents have been used in the treatment of lupus; this Review will focus on studies using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In addition, this Review will briefly describe the history of antimalarial drug use in patients with SLE, the theorized mechanisms of action of the agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, their efficacy in patients with SLE and those with lupus nephritis, their use in pregnancy, and potential adverse effects. The Review will also cover the latest recommendations regarding monitoring for hydroxychloroquine-associated or chloroquine-associated retinopathy. Overall, antimalarial drugs have numerous beneficial effects in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis, and have a good safety profile.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the daily and weight-adjusted dosages of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the effects on long-term remission in the Lupus-Cruces cohort.

Methods

Observational study of routine clinical care data. We selected inception patients treated with HCQ with at least 5 years of follow-up. Prolonged remission was achieved when patients fulfilled deﬁnitions of remission in systemic lupus erythematosus remission criteria in five consecutive yearly visits. The associations between the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ during 5 years and prolonged remission were analysed. We also investigated the associations between prednisone doses, immunosuppressives (IS) and other antimalarial use with HCQ doses.

Results

150 inception patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean starting dose of HCQ was 206 mg/day. The mean weight-adjusted starting dose of HCQ was 3.1 mg/kg/day with no patients treated with doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. Treatment with HCQ was maintained during the whole 5-year follow-up time in 148 patients (98%). The mean dose of HCQ during the 5-year follow-up was 194.6 mg/day (2.9 mg/kg/day). 108 patients (72%) were in prolonged remission. The mean weight-adjusted dose of HCQ per patient did not differ between those who did and did not achieve prolonged remission (2.9 vs 3 mg/kg/day, p = 0.5). The dose of prednisone per patient (mean 2.3 mg/day during the 5-year follow-up) did not differ according to the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ. The mean weight-adjusted HCQ dose during the whole follow-up was the same in patients treated or not with IS or with mepacrine.

Conclusions

With the use of HCQ at stable doses of 200 mg/day (or 3.0–3.5 mg/kg/day) as the background therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the majority of patients achieved prolonged remission.

Antimalarials

Antimalarials are among the oldest drugs for treating SLE. Following empirical use for years, the Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study demonstrated in 1991 the efficacy of HCQ in preventing lupus flares. However, for many years the use of antimalarials was limited to patients with cutaneous and/or articular involvement, thus playing a marginal role in core lupus therapy. This scenario has changed substantially during the last 10 years.

Clinical efficacy of antimalarials

Two observational cohort studies published in 2006 and 2007 showed for the first time that antimalarials can reduce mortality in SLE patients by > 50% (Table 1). Both studies used propensity score–adjusted analysis, thus overcoming the confounding by indication bias. Indeed, subsequent studies have widely confirmed these results in various ethnic groups, including Latin American and Chinese populations.

Table 1
Antimalarials and GCs in SLE

Apart from the well-known effects of antimalarials on disease activity, improvement in long-term prognosis is mediated by a reduction in the risks of thrombosis, vascular disease and damage accrual. A recent study from the Toronto Lupus Cohort showed that treatment with antimalarials for > 60% of the time during the first 5 years of disease may reduce the number of flares, damage accrual and cumulative dose of glucocorticoids (GCs). In addition, protection against infections has been observed in several cohort studies. A reduced risk of cancer was already suggested in 2007 by an early study of the Lupus-Cruces cohort. A 2017 British population-based study of patients with connective tissue diseases exposed and not exposed to HCQ did not find a reduced risk of developing cancer, however, the risk of metastases and death were significantly lower in the former group. More recently, a large nested case–control study including > 14 000 Chinese lupus patients has confirmed a protective, dose-dependent effect of HCQ against neoplastic diseases.

Collectively, there is wide consensus in considering HCQ an essential drug for lupus. Recent consensus guidelines agree in recommending indefinite therapy with HCQ (unless contraindicated) for all SLE patients, including patients with LN and during pregnancy. However, there is some controversy regarding the optimal dose, mostly due to concerns about retinal toxicity.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine, both 4-aminoquinoline drugs, were originally developed for malaria treatment. While chloroquine inhibits DNA and RNA polymerase, blocking Plasmodium 's use of hemoglobin, HCQ increases the pH in parasitic vacuoles, disrupting hemoglobin degradation. The key pharmacological properties of HCQ are summarized in Table 1. HCQ is widely used to treat rheumatological conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, by virtue of their immunomodulatory properties. HCQ's lower cost, favorable safety profile compared to other immunomodulators, demonstrated effectiveness as a modifying agent, and survival benefits in SLE have increased its use in developed countries. Unlike chloroquine, HCQ rarely causes retinal toxicity over similar treatment periods, contributing to its widespread use. Particularly for the treatment of SLE according to current guidelines, HCQ dosages of 5 mg/kg per day or less are recommended to reduce the risk of toxicity, but this may lead to increased flare-ups. It is the clinician's responsibility to balance the right dosage to suit the individual patient. HCQ is also used in dermatological conditions, such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous and mucosal lichen planus, cicatricial alopecias, dermatomyositis, and porphyria cutanea tarda. Table 2 summarizes the indications, relevant posology, and clinical benefit for the main dermatological conditions. Except for porphyria cutanea tarda, generally, for dermatological diseases, the dosage of HCQ used is 5 mg/kg/day, administered in clinical practice with a flat dose of 200 mg twice a day, and based on clinical response, doses may be decreased.

It is becoming clear that, more than focusing on specific drugs to treat different organ manifestation, the above goals are best aimed for, through a strategic plan tailored to each patient. This strategy has to take into consideration patient preferences, age and childbearing potential, safety and cost issues of available drugs. Key features of this strategy would typically include continuation of HCQ at all times (no evidence of toxicity provided), a dedicated effort to keep daily GC dose to an acceptable level through early initiation of IS agents and use of intravenous MP pulses, as well as reduction of drug doses in the long term (figure 3).

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^11599XNV]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy — treatment continuation decisions emphasize that patients will choose to stop these drugs to eliminate any further risk to their vision, especially those with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis for which other effective medications are available, whereas patients with severe systemic diseases, such as active lupus erythematosus, may not have good therapeutic alternatives and may choose (in consultation with their medical caregivers) to continue HCQ as long as possible. These choices have become more difficult with increasing ability to detect minimal or "pre-clinical" HCQ toxicity, and some of these patients may wish to continue HCQ with cautious observation, perhaps at a lower daily dose, until signs of retinopathy are more definitive and or nearer to a point that would signal visual risk. The ultimate decision should include the patient and the prescribing physician, rather than the ophthalmologist alone.

### Treating systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century: new drugs and new perspectives on old drugs [^115sfBeS]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Besides treating acute flares, the management of SLE should aim at preventing organ damage accrual and drug-associated harms, improving health-related quality of life and prolonging survival. At present, therapy is based on combinations of antimalarials (mainly HCQ), considered the backbone of SLE treatment, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, these regimens are not universally effective and a substantial degree of damage can be caused by exposure to glucocorticoids. In this review we provide a critical appraisal of the efficacy and safety of available treatments as well as a brief discussion of potentially novel compounds in patients with SLE. We emphasize the use of methylprednisolone pulses for moderate-severe flares, followed by low-moderate doses of oral prednisone with quick tapering to maintenance doses of ≤ 5mg/day, as well as the prompt institution of immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of severe disease but also as steroid-sparing agents. Indications for the use of biologic agents, namely belimumab and rituximab, in refractory or organ-threatening disease are also presented. We conclude by proposing evidence- and experience-based treatment strategies tailored to the clinical scenario and prevailing organ involvement that can aid clinicians in managing this complex disease.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease.SLE can affect all organs, particularly the musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiorespiratory, renal and mucocutaneous systems. The burden of SLE is defined by the severity and degree of the disease itself as well as resulting organ damage that may occur from comorbidities or from treatment.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of SLE set the ambitious goal of remission for SLE: that is, the absence of inflammatory or major haematological activity (clinical SLEDAI = 0) achieved with ≤ 5 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent. In addition to hydroxychloroquine, the EULAR recommendations advocate using immunosuppressive drugs (ISs) and biologics to achieve this goal. Typically, the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine is the first line of treatment and is recommended for all patients with SLE other than when contraindicated. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently administered and dosed according to the type and severity of organ involvement. However, their use is associated with short-term and long-term adverse effects, and though complete GC withdrawal is the optimal target, this is seldom attained. Azathioprine is the only IS that is approved in Europe for the treatment of SLE, although a number of other ISs are used in the real-world setting, including mycophenolate, which has been shown to be superior to azathioprine, both in renal and non-renal SLE. More recently, biologics have been studied as potential targeted treatments. In particular, the B-cell-activating factor inhibitor belimumab was approved in 2011 for the treatment of adult patients with active, auto–antibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy, and its indication was amended for lupus nephritis in 2021. Although the aetiology of SLE is still not completely understood, genetic, immunological, hormonal and environmental factors play roles in its incidence and heterogeneous clinical presentation.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112YwwDS]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with SLE are often treated with hydroxychloroquine in an uninterrupted fashion long-term in part to mitigate the life-threatening comorbidities of SLE. However, in patients with CLE who respond to hydroxychloroquine, it is sometimes withdrawn after 6–12 months of therapy to be restarted at the time of the next flare of skin disease activity. In this setting, the time periods between episodes of skin disease activity can be months to years. Thus, patients with CLE typically may have lower total cumulative doses of hydroxychloroquine compared with patients with SLE over the same time frame, thus mitigating the risk of antimalarial retinopathy.

Thus, it might be argued that in patients with CLE whose skin disease activity has not responded after an appropriate period of time to hydroxychloroquine 5 mg/kg/day, it may be appropriate to increase the daily dose to 6.5 mg/kg/day, especially if HCQ blood levels are low.

RESULTS

Among 1,389 individuals receiving care in the participating lupus clinics between January 1999 and January 2019, 1,344 (96.8%) were exposed to HCQ (Figure 1). We identified 398 patients (1,740 person‐years) who reduced the HCQ dose, and 395 (2,120 person‐years) who discontinued HCQ. Among those who maintained HCQ therapy (n = 629), 395 patients (792 person‐years) were successfully matched to patients tapering or discontinuing HCQ therapy on previous disease duration and time on HCQ. Overall, a total of 240 patients were lost to follow‐up, 62 withdrew consent, and 35 died during the follow‐up. All these patients were censored at the corresponding times.

Cohort selection. SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus.

The baseline characteristics of each of the 3 cohorts of patients with SLE are shown in Table 1. As expected, approximately 90% of the participants were female, and most were White. The primary composite outcome occurred in 261 of the 398 patients who tapered HCQ (35.7 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 31.6–40.3]), in 226 of the 395 patients who discontinued HCQ (29.0 per 100 person‐years [95% CI 25.5–33.0]), and in 97 of the 395 patients who remained on HCQ (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]).

### Iberdomide in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose, phase 2a study [^116Xra23]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients

Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis for ≥ 6 months of SLE per American College of Rheumatology 1997 criteriaand a hybrid Safety of Estrogens in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA)-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scoreof ≥ 4 points at baseline. This cut-off value was used to increase patient recruitment for this phase 2 study focused on safety, PK and pharmacodynamics. Patients could have qualified based on serology scores alone; however, all patients who entered the study had active disease and pertinent clinical scoring (skin and/or joints and/or other organ involvement). The hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI score is differentiated from the SELENA-SLEDAI score based on the definition of proteinuria, in which the hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI score uses > 0.5 g/24 hours and the previous definition of 'new onset or recent increase of > 0.5 g/24 hours' has been removed. Oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent daily) and/or antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and/or quinacrine) were allowed if doses had been stable for 4 weeks prior to randomisation. No other systemic immunosuppressive treatments were permitted during the dose-escalation phase. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide were permitted during the ATEP. Patients may have taken alternative standard-of-care therapies between study phases. Key exclusion criteria were unstable lupus nephritis (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m²), active central nervous system disease requiring therapeutic intervention within 6 months of screening and the presence of infectious disease.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114Kbp9Y]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a key systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) drug, making concerns of drug shortages grave. Our objective was to evaluate factors associated with poor outcomes after HCQ taper or discontinuation in SLE.

Methods

We studied 5 Canadian SLE cohorts between 1999 and 2019, following patients from the date of HCQ tapering (cohort 1) or discontinuation (cohort 2). A composite outcome was defined as any of the following: a need for therapy augmentation, an increase (of at least 4 points) in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 score, or hospitalization for SLE. In each cohort, multivariable Cox regression was used to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with time to the earliest of these events. A third cohort continuing to receive HCQ was also studied, to assess whether the same factors influenced the outcome even when the HCQ dose was unchanged.

Results

The poor outcome rate, per 100 person-years, was 35.7 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 31.6–40.3) in the HCQ taper cohort (n = 398), 29.0 (95% CI 25.5–33.0) in the discontinuation cohort (n = 395), and 16.1 (95% CI 13.2–19.6) in the maintenance cohort (n = 395). In patients tapering HCQ, baseline prednisone use was independently associated with greater risk of poor outcomes. In the discontinuation cohort, the risk of poor outcomes was greater for Black patients and those diagnosed with SLE at age ≤ 25years. Among those maintaining HCQ, baseline immunosuppressive use and First Nations ethnicity were associated with poor outcomes.

Conclusion

We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with poor outcomes after HCQ taper/discontinuation. This information is critical in the current setting of potential shortages, but over the long term, such information could inform personalized therapies.

### New therapeutic strategies in systemic lupus erythematosus management [^111VhtuQ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The current treatment approach for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as outlined in the recommendations by international medical associations including EULAR and the ACR, is mostly eminence-based rather than evidence-based. However, knowledge on SLE is growing quickly, and such new advances need to be translated into clinical practice. Questions remain regarding the choice and timing of drug administration and tapering until withdrawal, which both can affect the balance between the control of disease activity and damage to organs triggered by long-standing and/or disproportionate immunosuppression. Currently, the treating physicians of patients with SLE are required to weigh the present with the future situation of their patients in an optimized balance between therapeutic harm and benefit. In this Review, the available therapeutic strategies and main challenges in the approach to SLE treatment are discussed. Remission and low disease activity are desirable therapeutic goals. Although the drug armamentarium for SLE has not expanded much in the past few decades, there are nonetheless opportunities to make better choices and explore combination therapies; such opportunities offer the potential of a personalized medicine strategy.

DISCUSSION

Although our study was originally motivated by the desire to better understand personalized therapy in SLE, our findings take on new importance in the current setting, where physicians and patients may face shortages of HCQ, due to interest in this drug as a potential therapy for COVID‐19. Although current evidence shows that HCQ is not effective for COVID‐19, patients in many countries, including the US, Brazil, and India, are still using HCQ to prevent or treat the infection. In addition, HCQ shortages may occur in other circumstances, such as the prolonged manufacturing shortage faced by the US in 2015. Moreover, stopping HCQ by choice is not that rare; studies have shown that over 30% of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ by choice.

In this clinical cohort of patients with SLE exposed to HCQ, we observed that multiple demographic and baseline clinical factors are associated with poor outcomes, such as an increase in disease activity and a need for therapy augmentation, after HCQ taper/discontinuation. Tapering HCQ in Asian patients with SLE or when the patient is still on prednisone or with a SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 may result in poorer outcomes. Discontinuing HCQ may be associated with poorer outcomes in Black patients with SLE, and patients age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis. None of these factors were associated with the outcome among those maintaining HCQ, although First Nations patients and baseline immunosuppressive use were.

We did not aim to compare the 3 cohorts directly in terms of flare rate. However, the crude flare rate was significantly lower in the HCQ maintenance cohort (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]) than in the taper cohort (35.7 [95% CI 31.6–40.3]) and in the discontinuation cohort (29.0 [95% CI 25.5–33.0]). Of course, these crude rates do not consider the fact that variables like disease activity and concomitant medications may differ considerably between the cohorts. If patients tapered or discontinued HCQ solely because of inactive disease, we would expect lower outcome rates in the taper than in the discontinuation group. However, reasons for lowering the dose or discontinuing a medication are multifactorial and may have included patient tolerance, adherence, or even changes in guidelines, including the 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommendations, which cautioned against cumulative use of HCQ and lowered dosing to 5 mg/kg per day. Thus, not all patients were in remission when HCQ was tapered or discontinued. In fact, we observed that the proportion of patients with active disease (SLEDAI‐2K score ≥ 4) at baseline was higher in the HCQ taper cohort (46.7% [95% CI 41.8–51.6]) than in the discontinuation cohort (31.6% [95% CI 27.0–36.2]). Given this finding, the relatively high number of patients in the taper group with a poor outcome makes sense. The fact that the maintenance group had higher baseline disease activity (and more use of immunosuppressives, corticosteroids, and biologics) than the discontinuation group, but a significantly lower (not higher) flare rate, suggests that HCQ is beneficial is this group.

### Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy-implications of research advances for rheumatology care [^117NWLcN]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapy for rheumatic diseases, hydroxychloroquine remains almost universally recommended for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and is often used in the management of other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the major dose-limiting toxicity of hydroxychloroquine is retinopathy that can lead to loss of vision. New highly sensitive screening methods can identify early stages of retinopathy, and studies that include these modalities have indicated a substantially higher prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy than was previously recognized, resulting in revisions to ophthalmology guidelines and the recommendation of a low dose of hydroxychloroquine for many patients. However, the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine for treating SLE and other rheumatic diseases is unknown. Further studies are required to establish the effectiveness and retinal safety of the latest hydroxychloroquine treatment recommendations.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^117SMidX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines for SLE recommend using a hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dose less than 5.0mg/kg/day to reduce the risk of retinopathy. To determine if this dose reduction would have an impact on the clinical course of SLE, we compared flare incidence in a cohort of patients with SLE treated with two different oral HCQ dosages (≤ 5mg/kg/day or > 5mg/kg/day). As a secondary analysis, we compared HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and evaluated the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

Methods

We identified a cohort of patients with SLE taking HCQ for at least 6 months and followed for 24 months. At study entry and 6 months later, a blood venous sample was taken to measure HCQ blood levels by liquid chromatography. Incidence of new SLE flares after recruitment was put in relation to daily HCQ dose and mean HCQ blood levels. Cox regression analysis served to identify factors associated with SLE flares.

Results

83 patients were enrolled. We observed 11 (16%) flares that developed in mean 14.8 months of follow-up. The difference in terms of flare rate and mean HCQ blood levels between the two oral dosages was not statistically significant. There was a trend (p = 0.08) for high HCQ dose being associated with a lower flare rate. At Cox analysis, higher HCQ blood levels and older age at baseline were protective against flare occurrence, while concomitant immunosuppressant therapy showed significant positive association. HCQ blood levels did not correlate with prescribed HCQ dose.

Conclusion

Patients with low oral HCQ dosage tend to have more flares, although the difference was not statistically significant. Higher HCQ blood levels were protective against flare occurrence. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing HCQ dose.

### Early initiation of hydroxychloroquine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus to prevent progression to systemic lupus erythematosus: a long-term follow-up study [^111jGyFa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The progression from cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a significant clinical challenge, with identified risk factors but no established preventative strategies.

Objectives

To evaluate whether early hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initiation reduces the risk of CLE progressing to SLE.

Methods

A longitudinal study of 286 consecutive patients with isolated CLE (full study cohort), treated with HCQ (n = 186) or topical corticosteroids/calcineurin inhibitors (n = 100). Progression to SLE was defined using the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria.

Results

Progression to SLE occurred in 4.8% of the HCQ group and 27% of the topical corticosteroids/topical inhibitors group (P < .001). Early initiation of HCQ was associated with an 87% reduction in SLE risk over time (hazard ratio: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.06–0.27, P < .001), consistent across all CLE severity levels and both positive and negative baseline antinuclear antibody titers. Severe SLE with end-organ involvement was also significantly less frequent in the HCQ group (risk ratio: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.19–0.86, P = 0.003).

Limitations

Observational design.

Conclusions

Early HCQ treatment demonstrated protective effects against progression to SLE, supporting its use as a preferred strategy in managing CLE to prevent systemic involvement.

### Towards a practical management of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1136p1N1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Towards a practical management of fatigue in patients with SLE

In patients with significant disease activity, the main therapeutic target is remission (or alternatively low-disease activity) and reaching these goals can be sufficient to improve fatigue. However, a common situation is the presence of significant fatigue contrasting with the absence of disease activity or any underlying organic cause. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment escalation is not indicated and other non-pharmacological interventions such as psychological and behavioural assessment or physical activity workshops should be favoured. Importantly, lack of optimal physical activity as well as sedentary behaviour have been associated with fatigue in SLE. Physical exercise is recommended for the management of pain and fatigue in patients with inflammatory arthritis in the last European League Against Rheumatism recommendations. Physical activity has been shown to improve fatigue in patients with SLE, with more time spent in moderate or high physical activity associated with less fatigue. Patients with SLE with otherwise unexplained fatigue should undergo dedicated psychological assessment, and behavioural issues should be specifically taken care of using appropriate psychological counsellingand pharmacological intervention, when needed. The exact benefit of antidepressants on fatigue is difficult to assess in SLE because there is no specific trial, but there is no reason to believe that those treatments would not be appropriate, keeping in mind the potential interaction with hydroxychloroquine, which may lead to QT prolongation. Tobacco smoking cessation should be encouraged as it significantly reduces therapeutic efficacy of many drugs and could promote flares. Last but not least, hydroxychloroquine observance should be evaluated and if needed, non-scheduled hydroxychloroquine serum concentrations should be measured to verify therapeutic adherence and adjust daily posology.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^1174i3vC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

We studied adult patients with SLE exposed to HCQ during the study period. Starting from the first visit with HCQ exposure, we identified patients receiving a lower dose or discontinuing HCQ at a follow‐up visit. We created 1 cohort to study patients from the time they lowered their HCQ dose: in that case, time zero was the date of the first reduction of HCQ dose. Patients were right censored if they discontinued HCQ completely (for any reason), as they then entered the cohort of patients who had discontinued HCQ (where the date of first HCQ discontinuation was defined as time zero). Patients who discontinued HCQ but started chloroquine right away were not included in the discontinuation cohort, as they were still taking an antimalarial. Patients were followed until the outcome of interest, end of the study period (February 2019), death, or loss to follow‐up (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at).

HCQ use was assumed to be constant for the entire 1‐year period between 2 adjacent visits; if, for example, a participant was taking HCQ at the first and second visits but not at the third visit, then they were considered an HCQ user during the period between the first and third visits (approximately 2 years) and a nonuser from the third visit on (unless HCQ was reintroduced, which qualified as part of our outcome of interest). However, in sensitivity analyses, we repeated the primary analysis, reassigning the date that the patients tapered/stopped HCQ (from the first study visit where the reduction/stop was originally recorded) to a date 6 months prior (i.e. half‐way between study visits).

### Experience with the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of lupus erythematosus [^115mX33M]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is generally used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Western countries. However, chloroquine retinopathy became a problem in Japan, and chloroquine has never been used since then. Even now HCQ remains non-approved. Therefore, the Japanese Hydroxychloroquine Study Group has been organized, and activities have started to have HCQ approved within Japan. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of HCQ against the skin manifestations of lupus erythematosus. There were seven patients, all female, and they consisted of four patients with SLE (skin lesion type: discoid lupus erythematosus [DLE] in three, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in one and lupus erythematosus profundus in one), two patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (both DLE), and one patient with a combination of SLE and dermatomyositis. HCQ was effective in three patients and ineffective in the two patients. We could not judge the efficacy of HCQ in the other two patients. There were no adverse effects in any of the patients. Efficacy was exhibited against telangiectasia and erythema. HCQ is also an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients, and it is hoped that it will be approved for use in Japan very soon.

Class III/IV or Class V lupus nephritis — hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): "In people with LN who are not already on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we strongly recommend initiation and continuation of HCQ to manage and prevent extra-renal manifestations, unless contraindicated". The document adds that "this is a strong recommendation based on low certainty evidence", that "HCQ reduces risk of mortality in people with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis", and that "dose adjustment for low GFR should be considered because kidney disease is a risk factor for retinal toxicity".

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: primary care approach to diagnosis and management [^112fbMPm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects many systems, including the skin, musculoskeletal, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and reproductive systems. Family physicians should be familiar with the manifestations of lupus to aid in early diagnosis, monitoring patients with mild disease, recognizing warning signs that require referral to a rheumatologist, and helping to monitor disease activity and treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. The American College of Rheumatology has 11 classification criteria for lupus. If a patient meets at least four criteria, lupus can be diagnosed with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity. All patients with lupus should receive education, counseling, and support. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of treatment because it reduces disease flares and other constitutional symptoms. Low-dose glucocorticoids can be used to treat most manifestations of lupus. The use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents depends on the body systems affected. Patients with mild disease that does not involve major organ systems can be monitored by their family physician. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be referred to a rheumatologist. To optimize treatment, it is important that a rheumatologist coordinate closely with the patient's family physician to improve chronic care as well as preventive health services.

### Interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112Sxet4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common. Many interventions are used to treat SLE with varying efficacy, risks, and benefits.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Wiley Interscience Online Library, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (Virtual Health Library). We updated our search in September 2020, but these results have not yet been fully incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE compared with placebo, another intervention, no treatment, or different doses of the same intervention. We did not evaluate trials of cutaneous lupus in people without a diagnosis of SLE.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete and partial clinical response. Secondary outcomes included reduction (or change) in number of clinical flares; and severe and minor adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Sixty-one RCTs, involving 11,232 participants, reported 43 different interventions. Trials predominantly included women from outpatient clinics; the mean age range of participants was 20 to 40 years. Twenty-five studies reported baseline severity, and 22 studies included participants with moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE); duration of CLE was not well reported. Studies were conducted mainly in multi-centre settings. Most often treatment duration was 12 months. Risk of bias was highest for the domain of reporting bias, followed by performance/detection bias. We identified too few studies for meta-analysis for most comparisons. We limited this abstract to main comparisons (all administered orally) and outcomes. We did not identify clinical trials of other commonly used treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, that reported complete or partial clinical response or numbers of clinical flares. Complete clinical response Studies comparing oral hydroxychloroquine against placebo did not report complete clinical response. Chloroquine may increase complete clinical response at 12 months' follow-up compared with placebo (absence of skin lesions) (risk ratio (RR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.61; 1 study, 24 participants; low-quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between methotrexate and chloroquine in complete clinical response (skin rash resolution) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 1 study, 25 participants; low-quality evidence). Methotrexate may be superior to placebo with regard to complete clinical response (absence of malar/discoid rash) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.84; 1 study, 41 participants; low-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be little to no difference between azathioprine and ciclosporin in complete clinical response (malar rash resolution) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52; 1 study, 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Partial clinical response Partial clinical response was reported for only one key comparison: hydroxychloroquine may increase partial clinical response at 12 months compared to placebo, but the 95% CI indicates that hydroxychloroquine may make no difference or may decrease response (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16; 20 pregnant participants, 1 trial; low-quality evidence). Clinical flares Clinical flares were reported for only two key comparisons: hydroxychloroquine is probably superior to placebo at 6 months' follow-up for reducing clinical flares (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 study, 47 participants; moderate-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be no difference between methotrexate and placebo, but the 95% CI indicates there may be more or fewer flares with methotrexate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.83; 1 study, 86 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events Data for adverse events were limited and were inconsistently reported, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well-documented adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver problems, and retinopathy for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and teratogenicity during pregnancy for methotrexate.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence supports the commonly-used treatment hydroxychloroquine, and there is also evidence supporting chloroquine and methotrexate for treating cutaneous disease in SLE. Evidence is limited due to the small number of studies reporting key outcomes. Evidence for most key outcomes was low or moderate quality, meaning findings should be interpreted with caution. Head-to-head intervention trials designed to detect differences in efficacy between treatments for specific CLE subtypes are needed. Thirteen further trials are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated in this review; they may alter the review conclusions.

### Association of patient copayment and medication adherence in systemic lupus erythematosus [^114k4XZ6]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacological treatments for SLE have advanced over the past decades. Medications for this condition can ameliorate its morbidity and are recognised as safe and effective. Hydroxychloroquine has been the backbone of SLE treatment since its US approval in 1955. According to the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology management guidelines, SLE treatment is guided by the universal use of hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive medications (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Immunosuppressive medications facilitate disease activity control and achieving remission, as well as enabling glucocorticoid tapering. Immunosuppressive agent selection depends on several factors, most prominently disease manifestations and severity. Methotrexate and azathioprine are usually considered first line in patients who have poor symptom control after hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids. Mycophenolate mofetil is efficacious in renal and non-renal SLE but its cost may limit accessibility to patients.

Despite the known effectiveness and safety of SLE medications, adherence remains a barrier to treatment and thus to improvement in disease outcomes. Adherence to hydroxychloroquine is estimated to range between 15% and 58%. In an institutional-based convenience cohort (n = 1956), only 58% of individuals achieved adherence ≥ 80%. Qualitative studies and reviews examining adherence in SLE have identified medication costs, lack of patient acceptance of chronic illness, poor doctor–patient rapport and other factors as obstacles to medication adherence. The costs of insurance copayment may present an additional obstacle to adherence, particularly for individuals with limited social resources.

Studies of adherence to medications in SLE have mostly focused on hydroxychloroquine, while other immunosuppressants have had limited examination. We sought to determine the association between copayment magnitude for SLE therapies and adherence to them. We assessed adherence to hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressive medications including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate because of their widespread use in contemporary SLE management. We included relevant social factors — specifically household income and educational attainment — given their potential to contribute towards medication adherence. We hypothesised that higher copayments would be associated with decreased adherence to hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressive medications in individuals with SLE.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^1112LAjn]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between GC cumulative dose and HCQ coverage and patient characteristics such as sex, age, country of birth and health care utilization may be explained by differences in disease activity, comorbidities and adverse outcomes influencing the choice of treatment over time, aspects that we do not specifically evaluate in this study. However, the association between high HCQ coverage and high educational level, and receiving the SLE diagnosis at a university hospital, motivates continued educational efforts towards raising the awareness of updated management guidelines, towards both treating physicians and patients, to ensure equal care.

GC exposure is known to contribute to irreversible organ damage, including overall cardiovascular events, osteoporosis with fractures and osteonecrosis. Quantification of the reduction of organ damage and mortality as a consequence of improved disease management was out of scope for this study. However, organ damage in our nationwide cohort has not improved over the study time period, and neither has mortality (5-year mortality estimated to be 9.5%, 9.7% and 9.3% for cohorts with SLE diagnosis in 2005–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–2016, respectively [unpublished results]). Globally, a trend of decreased mortality in SLE was seen from the 1950s to 1980s, but it has not improved much since then.

The observed reduction of GC use is marginal. The median decrease in the 5-year cumulative GC dose over the course of the study period was only 753 mg, corresponding to a 0.4 mg decrease in GC daily dose over 5 years per patient. Previous studies suggest that this may have a small effect on adverse outcomes; for example it has been estimated that a 1 mg/day decrease in average daily dose would decrease the risk of organ damage by 3%. In another study, only a very high cumulative dose (> 560 mg/month) came with a clear increased risk of organ damage. In contrast to GC, HCQ use increased substantially with a median increase in HCQ PDC of 28.6% over the course of the study. Further research on the long-term usage of GC and HCQ, and how SLE management can be optimized, considering other treatment alternatives available, to improve clinical outcomes remains critically important.

### Recent findings about antimalarials in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: what dermatologists should know [^115Lb1Fv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimalarials (AMs), particularly hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), are the cornerstone of the treatment for both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). HCQ and CQ are recommended as first-line oral agents in all CLE guidelines. Initially thought to have potential therapeutic effects against COVID-19, HCQ has drawn significant attention in recent years, highlighting concerns over its potential toxicity among patients and physicians. This review aims to consolidate current evidence on the efficacy of AMs in CLE. Our focus will be on optimizing therapeutic strategies, such as switching from HCQ to CQ, adding quinacrine to either HCQ or CQ, or adjusting HCQ dose based on blood concentration. Additionally, we will explore the potential for HCQ dose reduction or discontinuation in cases of CLE or SLE remission. Our review will focus on the existing evidence regarding adverse events linked to AM usage, with a specific emphasis on severe events and those of particular interest to dermatologists. Last, we will discuss the optimal HCQ dose and the balance between preventing CLE or SLE flares and minimizing toxicity.

### Clinical impact of hydroxychloroquine dose adjustment according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines in systemic lupus erythematosus [^113rCEck]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study suggests that the adjustment of HCQ daily dose to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight does not have a significant impact on the short-term and mid-term outcomes of patients with SLE. Nevertheless, further studies including a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are necessary to reach further conclusions.

### Patient perceptions and preferences of biologic therapies in SLE [^117VwMEK]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease characterised by a diverse array of manifestations and the production of autoantibodies. Clinical features are quite heterogeneous and vary in severity between individuals and over time, with flares often occurring unpredictably. Disease activity over time can lead to irreversible damage and accumulate if uncontrolled and/or treated with potentially toxic medications. An estimated 70%–90% of affected persons are women, with an onset usually in the childbearing years. The prevalence is 20–70 cases per 100 000 per year for all women but is as high as 241.5 per 100 000 per year for black women in particular. The mean age at onset of SLE is also younger among black people. Patients from racial minorities are more likely to suffer from multiple comorbidities; they have higher prevalence of depression, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and worse health-related quality of life than whites.

Standard therapies for SLE include corticosteroids, antimalarial agents (eg, hydroxychloroquine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cytotoxic agents like cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents used in cancer or transplantation. Most of these agents have never been formally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in SLE, with the exception of glucocorticoids, aspirin and hydroxychloroquine. Although overall survival has improved from less than 50% at 5 years in the 1950s to greater than 90%, these therapies continue to be associated with incomplete response and significant toxicity. Furthermore, minorities have a higher burden of disease and worse outcomes on these standard therapies compared with whites.

Biologic therapies (biologics) are engineered proteins designed to enact specific effects on the immune system. Their use has greatly increased in the 21st century and spans a variety of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, multiple sclerosis and cancers. They represent an alternative to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, characterised by targeted effects on the immune system, and have the potential to reduce dependence on corticosteroids and induce and maintain remission. In 2011, belimumab, which inhibits soluble human B-lymphocyte stimulator, or BLyS, became the first drug approved by the FDA for SLE since hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids in 1955. As the first and only biologic therapy approved for SLE, belimumab also represents the start of a new biologic era with continued robust activity in the SLE therapeutic pipeline.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^111PRgBQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Several recent studies aimed to investigate temporal shifts in HCQ dosing in the context of revised guidelines, producing rather mixed results. One group reviewed prescription patterns in a large health network from 2007 to 2016 and reported reduced dosing over time with a marked decrease in percentage of patients receiving at least 400 mg HCQ daily in light of the 2011 guideline revisions. On the other hand, a retrospective review of electronic medical records of another health system documented that approximately 50% and 47% of patients seen from 2009 to 2016 were placed on excess initial doses according to the 2011 and 2016 guidelines, respectively. Of the patients, 56% were currently on excess maintenance doses per the 2016 guidelines. The authors concluded that the 2011 revisions had little impact on clinical practice and similarly tempered expectations for that of subsequent revisions.

Studies have found that concern for adverse effects is a significant cause of non-adherence to medication in patients with SLE. Fear over HCQ toxicity has been a limiting factor in prescribing HCQ for both patients and rheumatologists. There is a lack of data regarding non-reversible HCQ retinopathy/retinal blindness from HCQ use. The current AAO recommendations do not alleviate these fears. The lower dosing suggested by the new guidelines does not consider the limited therapeutic options for the treatment of SLE or the risk/benefit profile of HCQ compared with that of immunosuppressive medications. While rheumatologists understand the 2016 AAO recommendations, the results of the survey expressed appropriate concern that the guidelines lack sufficient evidence to support the change in practice that has ensued. The 2016 AAO guidelines and screening recommendations may be a step forward towards improving patient safety, but not necessarily improved outcomes in SLE. Technological advancements should continue to shape opinions on prevalence of retinopathy and suggest solutions for diagnosis and management. In any case, there is certainly a need for continued multidisciplinary collaboration between clinicians using HCQ to treat debilitating illnesses and ophthalmologists seeking to avoid potentially devastating consequences of overuse.

### Disease-modifying therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus for extrarenal manifestations [^111Sm4Jm]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our 2022 published working definition of disease modification in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was 'minimising disease activity with the fewest treatment-associated toxicities and slowing or preventing organ damage progression'. The objective of this review was to classify current SLE treatments according to the proposed non-renal disease modification criteria excluding toxicities. Based on a review of select clinical trial (n = 32) and observational study (n = 54) publications for 14 SLE medications across different therapeutic classes, and the authors' clinical experience, we evaluated disease modification potential as per the proposed framework at three time points. Specific criteria used to determine disease modification potential included a drug's capacity to reduce: (1) non-renal disease activity, (2) severe flares, (3) use of steroids/immunosuppressants and (4) organ damage accrual. Criteria 1–3 were assessed at 1 year and 2–5 years and, when positive, were considered evidence for disease modification potential; criterion 4 was used to confirm disease modification at > 5 years. Each treatment received one of four mutually exclusive designations at each time point: (a) criterion met, (b) indications of criterion met despite insufficient evidence in the literature, (c) inconclusive and (d) no available supportive data. This review excludes an assessment of potential toxicities. Eight of the 14 SLE treatments met ≥ 1 disease modification criteria up to year 5. Hydroxychloroquine improved overall survival at > 5 years, suggesting long-term disease modification, but no data on specific organ systems were reported. Belimumab was the only treatment to meet all criteria. Belimumab and hydroxychloroquine met disease modification definitions across three time points. Evidence for other SLE therapies was incomplete, particularly at > 5 years. Future studies are warranted for other treatments to meet the disease modification criteria. We discuss challenges to classification and possible updates to our published criteria.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus flares… [^1154sACr]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine prevents systemic lupus erythematosus flares and is recommended for all patients with SLE. 1 However, its long-term toxicity includes retinopathy, particularly at doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. 2 This dose-dependent risk led to 2016 ophthalmology guidelines3 and subsequent rheumatology recommendations1 to avoid prescribing hydroxychloroquine doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. We assessed the association of this dose threshold on lupus flares. We identified patients with SLE from Massachusetts General Hospital who had 2 or more rheumatology visits and used hydroxychloroquine between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, the 5-year period immediately following the 2016 hydroxychloroquine dosing guidelines. 3 This study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board, which waived informed consent. We repeated the analysis limited to moderate or severe flares, with mild flares included as control periods.

We conducted subgroup analyses by SLE duration, history of lupus nephritis, and baseline SLEDAI score. To characterize the dose-response trend for the risk of lupus flares, we used restricted cubic splines to generate a smoothed dose odds ratio curve. We used SAS version 9.
4. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided P <.
05. Of 342 patients with SLE who used hydroxychloroquine during the study period, 168 had at least 1 lupus flare and were included in the case-crossover analysis; 80 had a moderate or severe flare. The mean age was 43 years; 148 were women. The mean baseline clinical SLEDAI score was 3. 5; 25 had lupus nephritis, 72 used glucocorticoids, and 80 used oral immunosuppressants.

In this case-crossover study within a contemporary SLE cohort, hydroxychloroquine dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines, was associated with a higher risk of lupus flares, including moderate or severe flares. Furthermore, the dose trend analysis also suggested an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day.

### Treatment algorithms in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116QW7tD]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish agreement on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment.

Methods

SLE experts (n = 69) were e-mailed scenarios and indicated preferred treatments. Algorithms were constructed and agreement determined (≥ 50% respondents indicating ≥ 70% agreement).

Results

Initially, 54% (n = 37) responded suggesting treatment for scenarios; 13 experts rated agreement with scenarios. Fourteen of 16 scenarios had agreement as follows: discoid lupus: first-line therapy was topical agents and hydroxychloroquine and/or glucocorticoids then azathioprine and subsequently mycophenolate (mofetil); uncomplicated cutaneous vasculitis: initial treatment was glucocorticoids ± hydroxychloroquine ± methotrexate, followed by azathioprine or mycophenolate and then cyclophosphamide; arthritis: initial therapy was hydroxychloroquine and/or glucocorticoids, then methotrexate and subsequently rituximab; pericarditis: first-line therapy was nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, then glucocorticoids with/without hydroxychloroquine, then azathioprine, mycophenolate, or methotrexate and finally belimumab or rituximab, and/or a pericardial window; interstitial lung disease/alveolitis: induction was glucocorticoids and mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide, then rituximab or intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), and maintenance followed with azathioprine or mycophenolate; pulmonary hypertension: glucocorticoids and mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide and an endothelin receptor antagonist were initial therapies, subsequent treatments were phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and then prostanoids and rituximab; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: standard anticoagulation with/without hydroxychloroquine, then a thrombin inhibitor for venous thrombosis, versus adding aspirin or platelet inhibition drugs for arterial events; mononeuritis multiplex and central nervous system vasculitis: first-line therapy was glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide followed by maintenance with azathioprine or mycophenolate, and then rituximab, IVIG, or plasmapheresis; and serious lupus nephritis: first-line therapy was glucocorticoids and mycophenolate, then cyclophosphamide then rituximab.

Conclusion

We established variable agreement on treatment approaches. For some treatment decisions there was good agreement between experts even if no randomized controlled trial data were available.

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^113GCDnu]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Strategies and evidence level for maximising hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment in CLE

Long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine carries the risk of developing a 'bull's-eye' macular retinopathy. When these drugs began to be widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE in the 1950s and 1960s at very high daily doses (eg, 1000–1200 mg/day), some patients suffered loss of vision. It was subsequently learnt that daily doses of hydroxychloroquine no higher than 6.5 mg/kg/day based on ideal body weight greatly decreased the risk of antimalarial retinopathy (4 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). These daily dose regimens were used successfully over the next several decades in treating CLE and in mitigating the systemic manifestations of SLE, as well as its comorbidities such as premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

However, in 2016, the American Academy of Ophthalmology published new recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Because of concern about increasing incidence of antimalarial retinopathy, these revised guidelines recommended that patients should not receive more than 5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine based on real body weight (2.3 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). Some rheumatologists and dermatologists have expressed concern that the lower daily doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine resulting from these new screening guidelines could result in breakthrough of CLE and SLE disease activities. Increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose for previously hydroxychloroquine-refractory patients with CLE can significantly improve CLE lesions. Therefore, doses of antimalarials should be based on the risk:benefit ratio, although HCQ blood levels may be helpful, and in general, it is best to stay within the dosing guidelines because of eye toxicity.

### Hydroxychloroquine administration for Japanese lupus erythematosus in wakayama: a pilot study [^116ptFmZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used as the first-line systemic treatment for severe, widespread or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) in many countries. However HCQ is not an approved drug in Japan. For the establishment of HCQ therapy as the alternative treatment for CLE in Japan, we conducted a pilot study in Japanese patients with refractory CLE by administrating HCQ, and evaluated the improvements in the skin lesions using the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI). We administrated HCQ to seven CLE cases, including four systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases. The skin lesions of the four cases improved dramatically, and their mean CLASI activity index decreased significantly following HCQ treatment. Arthralgia improved in all three cases with arthralgia and general malaise also improved in two of the three cases who had complained. In three cases who discontinued HCQ therapy after 16 weeks of treatment, their skin lesions and general malaise worsened soon, and after the resumption of HCQ therapy these symptoms improved again. The mean serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels also decreased significantly at the end of this study. Our results suggest that HCQ might be effective for Japanese SLE skin lesions and CLE, and support the studies which reported that HCQ prevented clinical flare ups of SLE. An additional effect to improve lipid profiles was also observed in our Japanese cases. It is necessary to confirm that these effects are reproducible when Japanese lupus erythematosus cases are given HCQ.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114bDZfK]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In both tapering and discontinuation cohorts, we observed a negative association between a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 and the specific outcome related to "increase in SLEDAI‐2K score". This finding may represent a ceiling effect of the SLEDAI‐2K assessment tool, which prevented the detection of a worsening in disease activity in patients with a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4, and/or a regression toward the mean, where more active patients with SLE may get better over time, and less active patients may get worse.

Non‐White patients were more likely than White patients to have poor outcomes in all 3 cohorts. This finding was especially true in Black patients discontinuing HCQ, Asian patients tapering HCQ, and First Nations patients remaining on HCQ. Non‐White patients, especially Black and First Nations patients, not only may have more severe SLE due to innate disease characteristics, but may also face barriers to optimal health outcomes, including access to care issues (even in the context of Canada's comprehensive health care system, which does not cover the cost of out‐of‐hospital medications for all individuals) and poor medication adherence. In general, non‐White patients with SLE may have poorer outcomes due to sociocultural and psychosocial issues, including a higher risk for flares. As mentioned before, patients possibly discontinued the drug against physician advice; those patients may also have been nonadherent with other medications and physician advice, which could explain the findings of higher flare risk with Black patients who discontinued HCQ.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113nV9KM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus cutaneous/mucocutaneous disease — Good practice statements specify that people with SLE should be advised on the use of sunscreen and other sun-protection measures to reduce risk of rash and potential disease flare, and that initial therapy for cutaneous lupus rash — in addition to HCQ — should be topical, including glucocorticoid and/or calcineurin inhibitors; initial therapy may also include a course of intralesional glucocorticoid with dermatology and/or a brief, limited course of oral glucocorticoid. For mild, ongoing skin-predominant lupus despite treatment with HCQ and/or topical therapies, we conditionally recommend modifying antimalarial therapy (adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine) over adding an immunosuppressive agent (Conditional; Very low; P50.1, P50.2, P51.1, P51.2).

### Optimal use of antimalarials in treating cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112W4jHq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Antimalarials have been used to treat cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus (LE) for decades. Although controlled studies comparing the efficacy of antimalarials versus placebo and other treatments are generally lacking, many case reports and series support the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in treating both LE-specific and -nonspecific skin lesions. Currently, the two most frequently used antimalarial agents are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. There may be a delay of weeks to months in the onset of therapeutic effects of antimalarials when treating LE. Smoking appears to inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials when treating cutaneous LE. Antimalarials have been associated with a number of potentially serious adverse effects, including irreversible loss of vision. The aim of this review is to discuss the many facets of antimalarials that will help clinicians optimally utilize these agents when treating cutaneous LE.

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial [see Microbiology (12.4)] and antirheumatic agent.

Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus

The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus are not fully known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following oral administration, the whole blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine at steady state is dose proportional over a dose range from 200 mg daily to 400 mg daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients.

Absorption

Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmaxwas 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmaxwas 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmaxof 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax3.7 hours). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. Mean absolute oral bioavailability is 79% (SD: 12%) in fasting conditions.

Peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following a single dose of 155 mg intravenous infusion and from 2290 ng/mL to 4211 ng/mL (mean 3312 ng/mL) following a single dose of 310 mg intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.

### Hydroxychloroquine and CV events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus… [^117F4e6M]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this nationwide cohort study of patients with SLE, a protective association was found between the current use of hydroxychloroquine and the occurrence of CV events, but not between remote use of hydroxychloroquine and CV outcomes, highlighting the value of continuous hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by flare-ups and organ damage. 1–4 Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with SLE treated with hydroxychloroquine had a better overall relative survival rate than untreated patients, 5 and that they were significantly less likely to. The case group was patients with a first CV outcome event occurring at least 5 years after entry into the database to guarantee a sufficiently long period without CV outcomes. A secondary analysis allowed that period to be reduced to 2 years.

In both analyses, patients also were required to have at least 3 months after entry into the SLE cohort to ensure a reasonably long window of opportunity for hydroxychloroquine treatment. A sensitivity analysis used only 2 years without any CV outcome events after entry into the study. Hydroxychloroquine is beneficial for the treatment of CV diseases. 21–24 A recent nested case-control study of 10 268 patients with incident CV events and 29 969 controls conducted using British Columbia, Canada, administrative health databases found that patients with SLE or rheumatoid arthritis currently using hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of thrombotic events. 8 However, that study did not reach statistical significance for any CV events in the SLE subcohort. Our findings regarding the risk of OTE are consistent with those of other observational studies.

25–27 However, to our knowledge, this is the first study with usual-care data showing the benefits of hydroxychloroquine in improving arterial outcomes in patients with SLE. This finding is consistent with 2 studies8, 16 reporting a lower risk of MI in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine. In this cohort study using a nested case-control design and a national health care database, current treatment with hydroxychloroquine in patients with SLE was associated with a significantly reduced risk of MI, stroke, and OTEs compared with untreated patients. This protective association was not observed after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine treatment. These findings support the protective association of hydroxychloroquine against CV events and underscore the importance of continuous hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients diagnosed with SLE.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^115rRyxc]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy "has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus". Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with "a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58)", and "Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low". Safety screening notes that "Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine". For ocular monitoring, guidelines "do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment", and "yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²; dose of hydroxychloroquine > 5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise". Retinopathy risk is quantified as "affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be > 20% when treatment duration is over 20 years". Dosing guidance states, "The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels", and "a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare". Renal adjustment is specified: "In patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥ 25%". Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine "can be an expensive drug in some countries", and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, "but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted".

### Hydroxycloroquine blood concentration in lupus nephritis: a determinant of disease outcome? [^1153RbJz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a recommended drug in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has a long terminal half-life, making it an attractive target for therapeutic drug monitoring. The aim of this study was to establish a relationship between blood HCQ concentration and lupus nephritis activity.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study with data collected from clinical and laboratory records. Inclusion criteria were patients followed in the lupus clinic with biopsy-proven International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society Classes III, IV or V lupus nephritis on HCQ for at least 3months (200-400mg daily) and with HCQ levels measured during treatment. Exclusion criteria were patients on renal replacement therapy at baseline or patients lost to follow-up.

Results

In 171 patients, the HCQ level was measured in 1282 samples. The mean HCQ blood level was 0.75 ± 0.54mg/L and it was bimodally distributed. An HCQ level < 0.20mg/L [232 samples (18.1%)] appeared to define a distinct group of abnormally low HCQ levels. For patients in complete or partial remission at baseline compared with those remaining in remission, patients with renal flare during follow-up had a significantly lower average HCQ level (0.59 versus 0.81mg/L; P = 0.005). Our data suggest an HCQ target level to reduce the likelihood of renal flares > 0.6mg/L (600ng/mL) in those patients with lupus nephritis.

Conclusion

HCQ level monitoring may offer a new approach to identify non-adherent patients and support them appropriately. We propose an HCQ minimum target level of at least 0.6mg/L to reduce the renal flare rate, but this will require a prospective study for validation.

### Disease-modifying therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus for extrarenal manifestations [^112ropVP]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this review include its narrative approach rather than a more formal systematic literature review, and the general lack of consistent study outcomes aligned with the proposed disease modification framework criteria. In the case of hydroxychloroquine, this necessitated a special case consideration for use of survival data as a surrogate for SDI data. We did not consider the timing of treatments (for instance, induction/initial or maintenance/subsequent) when evaluating treatments as disease modifying. We also did not distinguish between background treatments, or comparators, which were very variable between studies, and across the decades of included research. We cannot rule out the possibility that the results were impacted by changes over time in standard of care and dosing regimens (eg, glucocorticoid dosing), as the evaluated criteria had been devised according to current standard practices, which could have limited the relevance of older studies. However, we note that hydroxychloroquine, which has been used in SLE for many decades, had a positive disease modification classification despite the age of many of the cited studies, suggesting that the study date was not a critical factor in the classification of treatments. As previously noted, this review did not consider data pertaining to treatment tolerability and focused instead on available evidence for the published framework criteria. Although HRQoL, patient-reported outcome measures and biomarkers were suggested as supportive elements to the main disease modification definition, they were not included in this analysis. Further research should consider these aspects for currently available SLE treatments, as ACR, EULAR and the WHO recommend that HRQoL be more frequently considered in clinical trials and practice, given that impact to quality of life is often overlooked in favour of disease activity and organ damage measures. Finally, this evaluation was funded by GSK, the manufacturer of belimumab. However, any risks of unconscious bias were mitigated through the involvement of several prominent SLE experts as authors. Each author contributed significantly to the approach, the study selection, data evaluation and application of the criteria.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114CAafM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Non-adherence by HCQ blood levels

Poor therapeutic adherence, reflected by at least one HCQ concentration ≤ 100 ng/mL value, was found in 17 (20%) patients. The proportion of non-adherent patients by drug level was 23% (10 of 42) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and 17% (7 of 41) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. Non-adherent patients differed from the other patients only for age at SLE diagnosis (20 ± 8.5 vs 27 ± 11.3 p = 0.01) and concomitant immunosuppressant therapy (13 of 17 vs 10 of 66; p < 0.0001). Patients labelled as non-adherent at study entry showed at T6 a significant higher HCQ blood concentration than baseline (median 0 ng/mL (range 0–99.4 ng/mL) vs median 515 ng/mL (range 0–1682 ng/mL); p < 0.0001). Since our results could be influenced by the lowest non-therapeutic HCQ levels found in non-adherent patients, we excluded such patients from the analysis. Of the 66 patients enrolled, 34 (42%) patients had mean HCQ value in therapeutic range, 31 (37%) were considered partially adherent and patients who had levels greater than 2000 ng/mL considered in supratherapeutic range.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory features of patients

All the remaining 66 patients were Caucasian, mostly female (99%), with a mean age of 42 (± 11.2) years and a mean SLE duration of 15.7 (± 9.02) years. The entire population had a median SLEDAI of 2 (range 0–4) and a median SLICC of 0 (range 0–2). The median time of remission was 2 (1–11) years. Previous renal involvement has been observed in 31 (47%). Glucocorticoid therapy was taken by 33 (50%) patients, while 17 (26%) of them were on immunosuppressants. No one has taken oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide. The median HCQ treatment duration was 5 (0–32) years with median HCQ levels of 512.6 ng/mL (range 104.4–3105.6). Demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of the patients enrolled are illustrated in table 1.

### Treating systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century: new drugs and new perspectives on old drugs [^115gVbgA]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

A proposal for treatment of SLE

Treating lupus is not just treating lupus flares. Additional objectives are to prevent or minimize damage accrual and serious drug side effects, prolong survival and improve quality of life. Accordingly, every effort should be made to design therapeutic schemes that rapidly control lupus activity, prevent future flares, do not increase damage by themselves and prevent other short and long-term complications.

To achieve these objectives, combinations of the previously discussed drugs can be used. Unfortunately, many choices are not guided by strong evidence and mostly depend on the experience and preferences of the treating physicians. While the role of HCQ or different immunosuppressive regimes in LN have been extensively studied, the indication for individual agents in other disease manifestations is supported by weaker evidence (see previous sections). An example of the variability in real-world clinical practice has been recently shown by a study revealing the great differences in GC use among the different SLICC participating centres.

A number of preliminary steps should be considered. Photoprotection is universally recommended, particularly in patients with photosensitivity and/or skin disease. All patients should receive HCQ as background therapy unless contraindicated, in which cases mepacrine can be considered.

In inducing a rapid remission of active lupus, GCs are still the main weapon. Data suggest that pulses of methylprednisolone can help control moderate–severe disease activity and allow the use of lower starting doses of prednisone (much less than the dogma of 1 mg/kg/day), with quick tapering. In the long-term prevention of flares, GCs should be considered on a case-by-case basis according to disease activity, with the final goal of discontinuation, if possible. If not, prednisone doses should not exceed 5 mg/day for chronic treatments.

ACR SLE treatment guideline — monitoring: In people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we conditionally recommend assessing disease activity regularly, including when there is a change in clinical status or SLE-directed medications, and in people with SLE, we conditionally recommend assessing disease damage at least annually; the Voting Panel prefers using a version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) to measure disease activity, and a physician's global assessment is also acceptable, with the importance of patient-reported outcome tools acknowledged.
