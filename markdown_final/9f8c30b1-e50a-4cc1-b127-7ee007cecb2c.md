## Question

Can progesterone cream protect the uterus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether progesterone cream can protect the uterus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline pathophysiology and why a progestogen is needed with estrogen in women with a uterus. Then, I should evaluate pharmacokinetic data on transdermal progesterone absorption and systemic exposure. Next, I will examine clinical outcomes data on endometrial histology with progesterone cream, followed by an assessment of compounding quality variability. After that, I need to review statements from regulators and professional societies. Finally, I will synthesize these findings into a practical, risk-aware recommendation, ensuring alignment with FDA labeling and NAMS guidance [^1157dZfP] [^116nHVgh] [^114UUsY1].

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale, because I need to ensure the foundation is solid before judging any delivery route. Unopposed systemic estrogen stimulates endometrial proliferation and increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma by roughly 2- to 12-fold, and adding an adequate progestogen dose and duration counteracts this risk and returns it to baseline, which is exactly why combined therapy is recommended for women with an intact uterus on systemic estrogen [^1157dZfP] [^114V63VE] [^116nHVgh] [^113q2S8s].

> Now, I will examine whether progesterone cream achieves the systemic exposure required to oppose estrogen effectively, and I should double-check both absorption and distribution. Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics first. Randomized crossover data in postmenopausal women show that 80 mg per day of progesterone cream is absorbed with delayed, low venous serum exposure and striking discordance between very high salivary or capillary levels and much lower venous serum, indicating nonuniform tissue distribution and unreliable systemic levels over 24 hours, which complicates using serum thresholds linked to endometrial protection [^111AaL9j]. Hold on, I should verify this finding with an independent dataset. After a single 64 mg application, serum progesterone did not rise significantly over 3 hours while salivary levels increased, reaffirming that venous exposure is low and variable compared with oral or vaginal routes, and suggesting delayed attainment of potentially active levels if they are achieved at all [^117N77iA]. I need to check whether creams can achieve luteal-like levels of about 5 ng/mL, and multiple reports note these topical preparations typically fail to reach that threshold consistently in venous serum, which is the compartment most linked to endometrial effects in trials of oral or vaginal progesterone [^112herxj].

> Next, I should review direct clinical outcomes on the endometrium, because pharmacokinetics alone could mislead if tissue effects differ. In one controlled series, women on transdermal estradiol plus up to 64 mg per day of progesterone cream for three cycles had serum progesterone at baseline-like levels and a high rate of endometrial proliferation on biopsy, indicating ineffective opposition in a majority of users [^112herxj]. Let me reconsider whether a longer study contradicts this signal. A 48 week study of estradiol gel plus 40 mg per day progesterone cream found that about one third of women had inadequate endometrial protection, including complex hyperplasia in a subset, again demonstrating clinically meaningful failure rates despite sustained use [^112herxj]. I should confirm that real-world case experience aligns, and reports of hyperplasia while using compounded estradiol with high-concentration topical progesterone support the concern that histologic protection is not assured with these topical products [^113NiyJm].

> I will now examine the quality and consistency of compounded creams, because even if the route were theoretically adequate, dose variability could undermine protection. Analytical testing across compounding pharmacies shows significant between- and within-pharmacy variation in both estradiol and progesterone content for creams, with coefficients of variation up to about 9 percent for creams and measured progesterone content deviating meaningfully from the labeled 100 mg per gram, which would make precise, reproducible endometrial protection even harder to achieve in practice [^1118NzTV] [^116umsp4]. I should confirm the regulatory context. Compounded hormones are not subject to routine FDA potency, purity, or contamination testing, so the delivered dose can be subtherapeutic or inconsistent, adding another layer of uncertainty to endometrial safety with creams [^113NiyJm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking authoritative positions. The FDA labeling for systemic estradiol repeatedly advises adding a progestogen in women with a uterus to reduce endometrial cancer risk, but there is no FDA-approved progesterone cream for endometrial protection, which implies a lack of evidence meeting regulatory standards for this indication and route [^1157dZfP] [^114UUsY1]. The North American Menopause Society has long emphasized that all FDA-approved progestogens protect the endometrium when used at adequate doses and durations, while compounded hormones may lack reliable bioavailability and may fail to protect the uterus, a stance that specifically cites failures of transdermal progesterone creams and gels to achieve protective serum levels or histology endpoints [^116nHVgh] [^112herxj]. I should verify international guidance as well. RCOG recommends against systemic estrogen-only therapy in women with a uterus and endorses continuous combined regimens or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for endometrial protection, without endorsing compounded progesterone creams for this purpose [^113JwhQc] [^112fss9c].

> Synthesis time, but wait, what if the formulation could be optimized to overcome the route problem. Progesterone is a BCS Class II drug with poor aqueous solubility and challenging transdermal bioavailability, so achieving consistent, therapeutic venous serum levels requires precise formulation and often higher doses than typically compounded, and salivary measures do not reliably reflect endometrial exposure, leaving clinicians without a validated monitoring strategy for topical progesterone's uterine effects [^116umsp4] [^117N77iA]. The combination of low, delayed, and variable systemic exposure, demonstrated histologic failures, and product variability makes reliable endometrial protection by cream pharmacologically and operationally unlikely in routine care, even before considering adherence and application-site variables that further affect exposure [^111AaL9j] [^112herxj] [^1118NzTV].

> Given all of this, I should state the bottom line clearly and then check that each pillar is supported. No, progesterone cream cannot be relied upon to protect the uterus from estrogen-induced endometrial proliferation, hyperplasia, or cancer risk, because systemic exposure is inconsistent and often subtherapeutic, clinical trials document substantial failure rates on endometrial biopsy, compounded dosing is variable, and no regulatory body has approved this route for uterine protection while multiple professional societies caution against it for this purpose [^111AaL9j] [^117N77iA] [^112herxj] [^1118NzTV] [^1157dZfP] [^116nHVgh] [^113JwhQc].

> Practical implications follow, and I need to ensure they are evidence anchored. Women using systemic estrogen with an intact uterus should receive an FDA-approved progestogen regimen that has demonstrated endometrial protection, such as oral micronized progesterone 200 mg daily for 12 days each cycle in a sequential regimen or a continuous combined estradiol plus progesterone oral softgel capsule that met FDA endometrial safety criteria with a hyperplasia rate under 1 percent in the REPLENISH trial, or a levonorgestrel intrauterine system when acceptable and appropriate, all of which have supporting data and guidance [^111MQy1D] [^113jmok2] [^113TpLk5] [^112EVYoW] [^113JwhQc] [^116HvuWF]. I should also emphasize standard precautions. Any unscheduled bleeding on hormone therapy warrants evaluation to rule out endometrial pathology per guideline and label recommendations, and therapy should be periodically reassessed to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest appropriate duration in line with individual risk profiles [^116o1psd] [^1157dZfP] [^114UUsY1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if a patient insists on continuing a compounded progesterone cream despite counseling. Initially, I wondered if simply using a higher topical dose would solve the problem, but the histologic failure signals persist even at doses up to 64 to 80 mg per day and serum levels still fail to achieve luteal-like concentrations consistently, so the safety gap remains, and if such use continues despite recommendations, the minimum risk-mitigation approach would be close surveillance with prompt investigation of bleeding and consideration of periodic endometrial assessment, recognizing that this remains a non–evidence-based path compared with approved alternatives and should prompt re-discussion of switching to validated regimens [^111AaL9j] [^112herxj] [^113NiyJm].

No, progesterone cream does not reliably protect the uterus because it delivers **insufficient systemic levels** [^111AaL9j] to oppose estrogen and prevent endometrial hyperplasia or cancer [^112herxj]. Clinical trials show **inadequate endometrial protection** with topical progesterone [^112herxj], and major guidelines (NAMS, ACOG, FDA) do not recommend it for this purpose. For women on estrogen therapy with a uterus, use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins at established doses [^114UUsY1] [^111MQy1D] [^113JwhQc].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and absorption of progesterone cream

- **Low systemic absorption**: Topical progesterone creams produce low serum levels [^111AaL9j], typically below the luteal threshold (~5 ng/mL) needed for endometrial protection [^112herxj].

- **Salivary vs serum levels**: Salivary progesterone rises after topical use [^111AaL9j], but serum levels remain low, indicating limited systemic availability [^117N77iA].

- **Formulation variability**: Compounded creams show significant dose variability [^1118NzTV], leading to inconsistent absorption and unreliable endometrial protection [^113NiyJm].

---

## Clinical evidence on endometrial protection

- **Insufficient endometrial protection**: Trials of topical progesterone (40–64 mg/day) with estrogen report inadequate protection [^112herxj]: 27% endometrial proliferation and 5% complex hyperplasia in one study.

- **Histological evidence**: Biopsies after topical progesterone often show proliferative or hyperplastic endometrium, indicating insufficient opposition to estrogen [^112herxj] [^112Bwetc].

- **Comparison with approved formulations**: Oral micronized progesterone (200 mg/day for 12 days/month) [^111MQy1D] and vaginal progesterone (100–200 mg/day) reliably prevent hyperplasia [^115PKz5e]; topical creams do not [^112herxj].

---

## Guidelines and professional recommendations

- **North American Menopause Society (NAMS)**: Topical progesterone creams are not recommended for endometrial protection due to inadequate systemic absorption and lack of evidence.

- **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)**: ACOG does not recommend topical progesterone creams for endometrial protection; use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins.

- **FDA stance**: The FDA does not recognize topical progesterone creams as effective for endometrial protection; they are not approved for this indication.

## Risks associated with inadequate endometrial protection

Inadequate progesterone exposure increases the risk of **endometrial hyperplasia**, a precursor to endometrial cancer [^113q2S8s]. Chronic unopposed estrogen significantly increases **endometrial cancer risk** [^1157dZfP], and insufficient progesterone opposition does not offset this risk [^112herxj]. Inadequate endometrial protection can also cause **abnormal uterine bleeding**, necessitating evaluation and intervention [^116o1psd].

## Alternative progesterone formulations for uterine protection

| **Formulation** | **Dose** | **Route** | **Endometrial protection** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral micronized progesterone | 200 mg/day for 12 days/month | Oral | Effective [^111MQy1D] [^115PKz5e] |
| Medroxyprogesterone acetate | 5–10 mg/day for 12 days/month | Oral | Effective [^112qkhjT] |
| Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system | 20 µg/day | Intrauterine | Highly effective [^113RpfGV] |
| Vaginal progesterone gel | 90 mg/day | Vaginal | Effective |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Progesterone cream **does not provide reliable uterine protection** because of low systemic absorption [^111AaL9j] and inconsistent dosing [^1118NzTV]. Clinicians should **use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins** at established doses [^114UUsY1] [^111MQy1D] to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with a uterus receiving estrogen therapy.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^113NiyJm]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

In general, the safety of compounded products has been a government concern for the last two decades, including issues with potency (too weak or too strong), purity (could contain harmful chemicals), and contamination (bacteria, fungus, or viruses). Compounded drugs are not subject to the same US FDA regulations or oversight as non-compounded products and are not routinely tested by any regulatory agency for quality, purity, or potency. Thus, some compounded products, including hormone therapy (HT), may be associated with increased risks.

Because the dose, duration, and ratio of estrogens to progesterone are well known to affect endometrial protection, ensuring the accuracy of the dose of the estrogen and progestogen components used for HT is critical. Improperly formulated HT combinations could have serious health consequences, such as endometrial cancer, in users. However, because compounded drugs are not systematically studied, limited safety reports are available. A few publications reported cases of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer with the use of custom-compounded estradiol and progesterone products prescribed to relieve menopausal symptoms.

- **Example case**: One woman diagnosed with atypical endometrial hyperplasia used a 2% compounded topical estradiol gel and a 6% compounded topical progesterone gel daily.

A North American Menopause Society (NAMS) survey of postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms also reported an increased risk of endometrial cancer and suggested an increase in vaginal bleeding with compounded HT compared with US FDA-approved products.

### Percutaneous progesterone delivery via cream or gel application in postmenopausal women: A randomized cross-over study of progesterone levels in serum, whole blood, saliva, and capillary blood [^111AaL9j]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

This study aims to investigate the distribution of progesterone in venous whole blood, venous serum, fingertip capillary blood, and saliva after its topical application in both cream and gel formulations.

- **Methods**: Ten postmenopausal women were randomized to receive 80 mg of progesterone cream or gel applied daily for 14 days, crossing over following a 14-day washout. On the last day of each treatment period, venous blood, fingertip capillary blood, and saliva were sampled frequently for 24 hours after the final application.

- **Results**: After progesterone cream or gel application, serum progesterone levels rose gradually, reaching a peak at 9 and 8 hours, respectively; AUC(0–24) h was significantly higher with cream (12.39 vs. 8.32 ng h mL(-1), P = 0.0391). Whole venous blood levels followed a pattern similar to that of serum but were considerably lower. Saliva progesterone showed a peak at 1 and 6 hours after cream and gel application, respectively, and C(max) was comparable with both cream and gel. Saliva AUC(0–24) h was substantially higher than the corresponding area under the curve for serum or whole blood but did not differ significantly by delivery method (39.02 and 58.37 ng h mL(-1), P = 0.69). In capillary blood, C(max) was reached at the same time (8 h) and was similar with both formulations; AUC(0–24) h was also similar with both formulations (1,056 ng h mL(-1) for cream and 999 ng h mL(-1) for gel) but was dramatically higher than the corresponding areas under the curve for venous serum and whole blood.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^112herxj]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast, compounded hormone therapy (HT) is not reviewed and approved by the FDA. Makers of compounded HT are not required to conduct the costly trials needed to prove the safety and efficacy of the medications they create. Compounded hormones that have inadequate bioavailability or do not contain the correct amounts of estrogens and progestogen may fail to protect the uterus. Several studies that evaluated compounded transdermal progesterone creams and gels in postmenopausal women observed posttreatment serum levels of progesterone far below the luteal level of 5 ng/mL.

- **Study by Wren et al**: Reported serum levels of progesterone similar to baseline levels among 21 women treated with a 100-μg estradiol patch plus up to 64 mg of progesterone cream daily for three 28-day cycles. In addition, a biopsy after cycle 3 showed that 13 women developed endometrial proliferation during the study.

- **Study by Vashisht et al**: Treated postmenopausal women (N = 54) with a compounded cream delivering progesterone 40 mg/day and with a compounded gel delivering estradiol 1 mg/day for 48 weeks. Biopsy results at the study's conclusion showed that the progesterone had provided insufficient endometrial protection for 32% of participants: 27% had endometrial proliferation and 5% had complex hyperplasia.

Many US women turned to compounded HT after findings from the Women's Health Initiative indicated that the risks of HT used to prevent chronic diseases outweighed its benefits. Surveys suggested that some women have been persuaded by marketing claims from compounding pharmacies that compounded hormones — also sometimes referred to as bioidentical hormones — are safer or more natural than FDA-approved products.

### Role of progestogen in hormone therapy for postmenopausal women: Position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116nHVgh]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen, or EPT) for the management of menopause-related symptoms. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged as experts in the field of postmenopausal hormone therapy were enlisted to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature and develop a position statement for approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

The results indicate that the primary role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy is endometrial protection. Unopposed estrogen therapy (ET) is associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. Adding the appropriate dose and duration of progestogen to ET has been shown to lower that risk to the level found in never-users of ET. The clinical goal of progestogen in EPT is to provide endometrial protection while maintaining estrogen benefits and minimizing progestogen-induced side effects, particularly uterine bleeding. EPT discontinuance correlates with uterine bleeding, with women who experience more days of amenorrhea having higher rates of continuance. All US Food and Drug Administration-approved progestogen formulations will provide endometrial protection if the dose and duration are adequate. Progestogens may diminish the beneficial effects of ET on cardiovascular risk factors. However, no EPT (or ET) regimen should be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular issues.

### Estrogen and progesterone receptors and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, and normal endometrium [^1153MxCf]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is seen in endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, and normal endometria, and whether it correlates with expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: The study was a retrospective, IRB-approved analysis of biopsy samples from 14 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, 19 with endometrial hyperplasia, and 10 with normal endometrium. Samples from women with a history of pelvic radiation, NSAID use, or hormone treatment during the previous year were excluded. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Expression of COX-2, estrogen, and progesterone receptors were scored according to the proportion of positive-staining cells: 1(+) for 50%. A score ≥ 2(+) was considered positive. Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance were used to compare proportions and continuous variables, respectively.

- **Results**: Overexpression of COX-2 was observed in 4 (29%) of the endometrial cancers, 6 (32%) of the endometrial hyperplasia cases, and 4 (20%) of the normal endometria, though these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.90). No COX-2 expression was found in stromal tissue. Among the 14 endometrial cancers, 7 (50%) expressed any COX-2, with 4 (29%) having an expression score of ≥ 2(+). Of the 19 endometrial hyperplasias, 11 (58%) expressed any COX-2, with 6 (32%) having a score of ≥ 2(+). All 10 normal endometria showed only 1(+) expression. No significant differences were detected in COX-2 expression by grade or stage.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1118NzTV]. Menopause (2019). High credibility.

To analytically characterize the doses of estradiol and progesterone found in compounded combined forms of oral capsule and transdermal cream formulations, this study aims to determine the consistency of the hormone formulations within a batch.

- **Methods**: Prescriptions for combined estradiol/progesterone capsules (0.5 and 100 mg, respectively) and creams (0.5 and 100 mg/g, respectively) were sent to 15 custom-compounding pharmacies. Estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassays. Hormone levels were measured in 2 capsules and 2 creams from each pharmacy; 10 capsules from 3 pharmacies; and top, middle, bottom layers of cream containers to assess consistency. The magnitude and sources of variation for the measurements were examined by analysis of variance models.

- **Results**: Thirteen pharmacies filled the prescriptions. Measured estradiol levels were 0.365 to 0.551 mg for capsules and 0.433 to 0.55 mg/g for creams, and progesterone levels were 90.8 to 135 mg for capsules and 93 to 118 mg/g for creams. Greater variations in estradiol levels were observed between pharmacies for estradiol in capsules than in creams; however, measured estradiol levels within pharmacies were more consistent in the capsules than in the creams. Similar results were obtained for progesterone levels.

The variations in estradiol and progesterone levels observed in compounded hormone therapy formulations justify concerns regarding risks as a result of variability, which have been outlined by The North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians.

### Estrace [^1157dZfP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important (see PRECAUTIONS). Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Breast cancer**: The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (green-top guideline no. 67) [^113JwhQc]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

The BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines specifically address the management of endometrial hyperplasia in patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy. It is recommended not to offer systemic estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy to females with a uterus.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top Guideline No. 67) [^116HvuWF]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

In the context of endometrial hyperplasia, particularly for patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, the 2016 BSGE/RCOG guidelines recommend offering the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as first-line therapy. Oral progestogens should be considered as a second alternative for patients with atypical hyperplasia who wish to preserve their fertility or are ineligible for surgery.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^112EVYoW]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single-capsule, bioidentical 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) hormone therapy on mammograms and breasts in postmenopausal women after 1 year of use.

Methods: In the 12-month, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter REPLENISH trial, postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 years) with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and a uterus were randomized to four active daily dose groups of E2/P4 (TX-001HR) or a placebo group. Mammograms were performed and read locally at screening (or within 6 months before the first dose) and at study end using BI-RADS classification. The incidence of abnormal mammograms and breast adverse events was evaluated.

Results: All but 8 (0.4%) mammograms at screening were normal (BI-RADS 1 or 2). At 1 year, 39 (2.9%) of the 1,340 study-end mammograms were abnormal (BI-RADS 3 or 4); the incidence was 1.7% to 3.7% with active doses and 3.1% with placebo. Breast cancer incidence was 0.36% with active doses and 0% with placebo. Breast tenderness was reported at frequencies of 2.4% to 10.8% with active doses versus 0.7% with placebo and led to eight study discontinuations (1.6% of discontinuations in active groups).

In this phase 3 trial of a combined E2/P4, results of secondary outcomes suggest that E2/P4 may not be associated with an increased risk of abnormal mammograms versus placebo, and the incidence of breast tenderness was low relative to most of the rates reported in other studies using hormone therapy.

### Guideline no. 390-classification and management of endometrial hyperplasia [^113RpfGV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly concerning progestin therapy, the SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend offering the levonorgestrel intrauterine system as first-line therapy in patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. This recommendation is due to its effectiveness, favorable side effect profile, and the possibility of maintaining it for 5 years in patients responding to treatment.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: Analyses of data from 2 Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use. This study aims to report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010. Specifically, 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to receive conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo, with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years. Another 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to receive conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo, with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

Main outcomes and measures included time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and post-intervention phases in the 2 HT trials. In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for 2 years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout the intervention. This ultimately resulted in a significantly increased HR for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early post-intervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1171Xg7M]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Many postmenopausal women are treated with hormone therapy (HT) to alleviate menopausal symptoms, primarily hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal atrophy, and to prevent osteoporosis. The postmenopausal period is considered an endocrine-deficient state, and HT can help restore the premenopausal endocrine milieu. Estrogen is the principal hormone used to treat postmenopausal symptoms. A variety of estrogenic preparations are available, including the natural endogenous estrogen, 17β-estradiol. To prevent endometrial hyperplasia from exogenous estrogens in women with a uterus, a progestogen is used either continuously combined or sequentially with the estrogens. The progestogens available for therapeutic use include synthetic progestogens (progestins) and natural progestogen (progesterone).

A high demand for HT-containing natural hormones is evidenced by the estimated annual prescriptions of up to 21 million products containing natural progesterone, representing the most prescribed form of HT in the United States. Because there was no single US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved formulation containing both estradiol and progesterone before 2018, most of these (up to 18 million prescriptions) were for non-US FDA-approved compounded HT. In October 2018, the US FDA approved the first oral softgel capsule containing 1 mg of estradiol and 100 mg of progesterone, marketed as Bijuva (TherapeuticsMD, Boca Raton, FL).

### Endometrial effects, bleeding control, and compliance with a new postmenopausal hormone therapy regimen based on transdermal estradiol gel and every-other-day vaginal progesterone in capsules: A 3-year pilot study [^112HYZPu]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

In a 3-year prospective study, 30 postmenopausal women received transdermal E2 gel and every-other-day vaginal P in capsules. At the study's completion, endometrial thickness was significantly reduced as compared with baseline (2.7 ± 0.5 vs. 3.4 ± 0.9 mm). Endometrial biopsy showed endometrial atrophy in all cases, and amenorrhea was achieved in 92.6% of cycles, while excellent patient satisfaction was achieved.

### Progesterone [^112ZNEAH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Progesterone injection, a progestin, is a sterile solution of progesterone in a suitable vegetable oil available for intramuscular use. Progesterone occurs as a white or creamy white crystalline powder. It is odorless and stable in air. While practically insoluble in water, it is soluble in alcohol, acetone, and dioxane, and sparingly soluble in vegetable oils.

It has the following structural formula: C21H30O2 with a molecular weight of 314.47. Its chemical name is pregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione.

Each milliliter contains: Progesterone 50 mg, Benzyl Alcohol 10% as a preservative in Sesame Oil q.s.

### Vaginal rings delivering progesterone and estradiol may be a new method of hormone replacement therapy [^113xAEWx]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether a low dose of progesterone delivered together with estradiol from a vaginal ring on a continuous schedule can prevent endometrial proliferation and yield a bleeding pattern dominated by amenorrhea, a longitudinal clinical study was conducted at three university hospitals. The study involved fifty-five women aged 45 to 75 years who had not undergone hysterectomy, with estradiol levels of less than 20 pg/mL and a hot-flash incidence of two or more per day in the past week.

Participants used a vaginal ring delivering approximately 150 micrograms per day of 17beta-estradiol and approximately 5 mg/day or approximately 9 mg/day of progesterone continuously for 4 to 6 months. The main outcome measures were endometrial thickness, bleeding pattern, and hot flash incidence.

Results showed that endometrial proliferation was prevented by both doses of progesterone. The bleeding incidence decreased, with 8 out of 12 women experiencing no bleeding in months 4, 5, and 6. The incidence of hot flashes and night sweats decreased quickly and significantly.

In conclusion, a vaginal ring delivering estradiol and a low dose of progesterone merits further study as a method for long-term hormone replacement therapy.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top guideline no. 67) [^1153Bzkr]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients receiving tamoxifen, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems in patients with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. This is due to the unknown effect on breast cancer recurrence risk. However, there is evidence that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems prevent polyp formation and reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in patients receiving tamoxifen.

### Endometrial hyperplasia: A review [^113q2S8s]. Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey (2004). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on endometrial hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: Endometrial hyperplasia is an abnormal growth of endometrial glands and stroma due to excessive estrogen exposure and can be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia is primarily driven by chronic exposure to unopposed estrogen, which stimulates the proliferation of endometrial cells, and a deficiency in progesterone, which normally counteracts the effects of estrogen by inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is estimated at 133 per 100,000 woman-years, peaking at ages 50–60. The peak incidences of simple, complex, and atypical endometrial hyperplasia are estimated at 142, 213, and 56 per 100,000 woman-years, respectively.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia include obesity, diabetes, PCOS, and postmenopausal status, all of which can lead to an excess of estrogen. Certain medications, such as tamoxifen and selective estrogen-receptor modulators, can also increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, endometrial hyperplasia most commonly presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which can manifest as heavy menstrual bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of endometrial hyperplasia varies based on the type of hyperplasia and the presence of atypical cells. While most cases of endometrial hyperplasia are benign, there is a potential for progression to endometrial cancer.

### Effects and side-effects of 2% progesterone cream on the skin of peri- and postmenopausal women: results from a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized study [^1152yris]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

For many years, topical progesterone has been prescribed by gynecologists as an anti-aging and skin-firming treatment without any clinical scientific evidence of its effects, tolerability, and safety when applied to the skin.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the influence of 2% progesterone cream on the function and texture of the skin in peri- and postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: A double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in 40 subjects. Objective methods for measuring skin elasticity, epidermal hydration, and skin surface lipids, clinical monitoring and self-assessment, and determination of blood hormone levels (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estrogen, and progesterone) were used to determine effects and side-effects of this treatment at four visits over a 16-week period.

- **Results**: The study demonstrated a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in the elastic skin properties in the treatment group, as demonstrated by objective measurements of three skin elasticity parameters, whereas in the control group, no such effect was observed. This effect in the treatment group was further paralleled by the results of the clinical monitoring, where the 2% progesterone cream showed consistent superiority over the vehicle in counteracting different signs of aging in the skin of peri- and postmenopausal women. Clinical monitoring showed a greater reduction in wrinkle counts (29.10% vs. 16.50%) and wrinkle depth (9.72% vs. 7.35%) around the right eye, a greater decrease in nasolabial wrinkle depth (9.72% vs. 6.62%), and a significantly higher (P < 0.05).

### Evaluation of endometrial progesterone receptor expression after 12 weeks of exposure to a low-dose vaginal estradiol insert [^113VPDH7]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

Vaginal versus oral administration of estrogens has been shown to provide lowered systemic exposure when used for the treatment of local VVA symptoms. While studies have shown no significant increase in endometrial or breast cancer and cardiovascular risk with vaginal estrogens, the direct effects of vaginal estrogens on the endometrium have not been well studied. Because of this lack of direct, definitive evidence to support endometrial safety with low-dose vaginal estrogen, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required the addition of the boxed warning of systemically administered estrogens, which includes risks of endometrial cancer, for all vaginal estrogen products.

To assess whether vaginal E2 may have a direct effect on the endometrium, the progesterone receptor (PGR) was used as a biomarker of E2 exposure. Endometrial PGR expression is one of the most sensitive gene responses to estradiol. We hypothesized that there may be insufficient E2 exposure from the 4-μg and 10-μg E2 vaginal inserts placed in the lower part of the vagina to increase endometrial PGR expression. If bioavailable estradiol is insufficient to stimulate PGR expression, we would not expect inserts to cause endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia/cancer. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the expression of PGR in endometrial tissues of women who used the softgel vaginal E2 or placebo insert in the REJOICE study.

### Estradiol [^114UUsY1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider adding a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus generally does not need a progestogen with her estrogen therapy. However, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may require a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically to determine if treatment is still necessary.

- **Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause**: Start therapy with the estradiol transdermal system at 0.0375 mg per day, applied to the skin twice weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue the estradiol transdermal system at intervals of 3 to 6 months.

- **Application instructions**: Place the adhesive side of the estradiol transdermal system on a clean, dry area on the lower abdomen (below the umbilicus) or buttocks. Do not apply the estradiol transdermal system to the breasts. Replace the estradiol transdermal system twice weekly (every 3 to 4 days). Rotate the sites of application, with an interval of at least 1 week between applications to a particular site. Select an area for application that is not oily, damaged, or irritated. Avoid the waistline, as tight clothing may interfere.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^116umsp4]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Estradiol and progesterone are highly potent molecules with low aqueous solubility. These characteristics pose a challenge to formulating these hormones consistently. Specifically, progesterone is categorized as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class II drug, which is poorly soluble and highly permeable. Its bioavailability is closely associated with its solvation rate, thereby being significantly impacted by the method of formulation.

Testing of steroid hormone products from compounding pharmacies indicates that the received dose may differ from the actual prescribed dose. An evaluation of estradiol and progesterone doses in compounded formulations revealed variability in consistency across different pharmacies, as well as within individual batches. Our results demonstrated that for estradiol in capsules, there was greater variation between pharmacy-compounded capsules (mean range: 0.370–0.525 mg) compared to creams (mean range: 0.445–0.507 mg/g). However, within individual pharmacies, capsules showed more consistency (coefficient of variation % CV: 2.66–4.56) than creams (% CV: 2.98–9.17).

Similarly, the range of means for progesterone in capsules was between 91.4 to 131 mg, compared to creams which ranged from 94.7 to 112 mg/g between different pharmacies. However, the within-pharmacy consistency was similar for both capsules (% CV: 6.05–7.27) and creams (% CV: 2.11–7.20).

### Menopausal hormone therapy in a health maintenance organization before and after Women's Health Initiative hormone trials termination [^115MkGcR]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

In July 2002, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) published results that led to the early termination of the randomized controlled trial of estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Subsequently, the trial of estrogen only was also terminated early, and the results were published in April 2004. This study examines the impact of both sets of results on menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) prescription patterns, as well as the characteristics of women who did and did not change their MHT behavior after the publication of results.

- **Methods**: We examined the number of MHT prescriptions filled in the months before and after each set of results was published, using claims data from 24,446 women aged 50–79 years who were continuously enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO) at Henry Ford Health System from January 2000 through December 2004.

- **Results**: After July 2002, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) drop occurred in the rate of MHT prescriptions filled; 29% of the women stopped MHT for at least 4 months, but 24% of these women resumed use by December 2004. Successful stoppers tended to be older. Twenty-one percent of users in April 2004 stopped in May 2004 for at least 4 months; 25% of these had restarted by December. Women continued to initiate MHT after July 2002, but at lower rates in 2003 and 2004 (73% and 77% decreases, respectively, compared with 2001). The types of MHT prescriptions obtained by new users changed after 2001: fewer initiated MHT with oral Premarin (Wyeth, St. David's, PA) and Prempro or Premphase (Wyeth-Ayerst).

### Evaluation of endometrial progesterone receptor expression after 12 weeks of exposure to a low-dose vaginal estradiol insert [^113RJxAQ]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

Based on these data, several professional organizations, including NAMS and ACOG, have stated that there is no need for women to use an additional progestogen for endometrial protection, and that no endometrial surveillance is necessary with the use of vaginal estrogen unless a woman presents with unexpected vaginal bleeding. While the FDA requires a boxed warning for all estrogen therapies, the majority of the data found in the literature do not show an association between low-dose vaginal estrogens and endometrial cancer. No association was found in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (1993–2005) and Extension Study (2005–2010), a large cohort trial that evaluated 45,663 women. Similarly, the Nurses' Health Study (1992–2002) found a nonsignificant association of vaginal estrogen use with endometrial cancer (HR = 1.52, 95% CI 0.78–2.98), which was lower after removing women who had previously used systemic estrogen and adjusting for those who had used systemic estrogen plus progestin or progestin alone (HR = 1.24, 95% CI 0.64–2.41). A systematic review of 38 studies (20 randomized controlled trials, 8 interventional studies, and 10 observational studies) also did not support an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with low-dose vaginal estrogens.

Some limitations of our study include the relatively low number of biopsies analyzed, no systemic estradiol measurements at baseline and at 12 weeks, and the fact that this was a post hoc analysis. While endometrial PGR expression is very sensitive to estrogens, the systemic level of estradiol/estrogens was not measured.

### Provera [^114V63VE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last more than ten years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Endometrial cancer**: An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about two to twelve times greater.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top guideline no. 67) [^112fss9c]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend offering a switch to continuous progestogen with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Alternatively, a continuous combined hormone replacement therapy preparation can be considered in patients with endometrial hyperplasia who are taking a sequential hormone replacement therapy preparation and wish to continue hormone replacement therapy.

### Bioidentical hormones for menopausal hormone therapy: Variation on a theme [^114XwCqg]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Progesterone creams and natural or bioidentical compounded estrogen preparations are being promoted to consumers as safe alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy and as health-promoting tonics; however, no reliable data support these claims.

- **Safety**: Natural hormones, including estradiol, estriol, estrone, and progesterone, can be expected to have the same adverse event profile as conventional menopausal hormone regimens.

- **Salivary hormone tests**: Salivary tests may be used to persuade asymptomatic consumers to use hormones (or symptomatic patients to use higher doses than those needed to mitigate symptoms), a practice that can be expected to result in adverse events.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^115LcN9D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

We used vaginal, micronized progesterone in the PROMISE and PRISM trials. The results from these trials are not necessarily generalizable to progestogens such as dydrogesterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The natural progesterone used in the PROMISE and PRISM trials is derived from soybeans and Mexican yam roots, and it has an identical chemical structure to physiological progesterone synthesized in the human body. Synthetic progestogens, which include dydrogesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, have different molecular structures, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles compared to natural progesterone. We have restricted our analysis to progesterone, and our data do not support or refute the role of other progesterone-like compounds.

- **Implications for clinical practice**: In summary, the PRISM and PROMISE trials found a small but positive treatment effect that seems to be dependent on the number of miscarriages. Our analysis did not suggest any benefit from progesterone therapy for women with early pregnancy bleeding but no history of miscarriages. We believe that the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages identify high-risk women in whom progesterone is beneficial. The question is how this should affect clinical practice. We recommend that the information be communicated to women at high risk of miscarriages to enable shared decision-making. Our suggestion is to consider offering progesterone to women with vaginal bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116o1psd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology. This assessment is crucial for identifying endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in patients with persistent unscheduled bleeding while on menopausal hormone therapy.

### Management of premenstrual syndrome: Green-top guideline no. 48 [^1148VWsS]. BJOG (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for endometrial hyperplasia, specifically with respect to primary prevention, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend considering offering a cyclical 10–12 day course of oral or vaginal progesterone. Alternatively, long-term progestogen treatments, such as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (52 mg), may be used to prevent endometrial hyperplasia in patients with premenstrual syndrome who are receiving percutaneous estradiol.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^115PKz5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Declining circulating estrogen levels around the time of menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone therapy, including both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations, is an effective treatment for these symptoms but is associated with risks. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose, with treatment reviewed regularly. This review aims to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia does not increase compared to placebo. The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2008), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to May 2008), and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy, and/or sequential estrogen-progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period.

### Bleeding patterns of the hormone replacement therapies in the postmenopausal estrogen and progestin interventions trial [^1145Kf7M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore whether significant differences exist between bleeding patterns with common regimens of hormone replacement therapy using two different progestogens. A total of 875 women in the Postmenopausal Estrogen and Progestin Interventions Trial took either placebo, conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg, conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in a continuous fashion, or conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg daily plus either cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg or cyclical micronized progesterone 200 mg/day for 12 days per month. Bleeding days, amounts, and episodes were recorded in diaries and aggregated by 6-month intervals for 3 years for the 596 participants with a uterus. Any bleeding for women on continuous regimens, or more than six episodes of bleeding per 6-month period for cyclical regimens, was considered excess.

- **Results**: Conjugated equine estrogen plus micronized progesterone cyclical was associated with fewer excess episodes of bleeding than conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate continuous in the first six months. Quantities of bleeding for conjugated equine estrogen plus micronized progesterone cyclical were less than for conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate cyclical through 30 months and for the number of bleeding days through study end. The 3-year cumulative quantities, days, and episodes of bleeding were significantly lower for conjugated equine estrogen plus micronized progesterone cyclical than for conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^112bLkXm]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, published by Rossouw JE and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA, explores the influence of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women. This research targets diseases such as coronary artery disease and menopause.

The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving a population of 16,608 female patients. The inclusion criteria specified healthy postmenopausal women aged between 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus at baseline. Key exclusion criteria included any medical condition likely associated with a predicted survival of less than three years, prior breast cancer, other cancers within the last 10 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), low hematocrit or platelet counts, alcoholism, or dementia.

In terms of interventions:

- **Estrogen plus progestin group**: 8,506 participants received conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d) in one tablet.
- **Placebo group**: 8,102 participants received a matching placebo tablet.

The primary outcome indicated a borderline significant increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (0.37% vs. 0.3%; HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.63). Secondary outcomes included:

- No significant difference in stroke (0.29% vs. 0.21%; HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07).
- A borderline significant increase in venous thromboembolic disease (0.34% vs. 0.16%; HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.82).
- A borderline significant decrease in osteoporotic fractures (1.47% vs. 1.91%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85).

### The safety of oral versus transdermal estrogen [^1142wTRy]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

There exists a growing number of treatment options available to women who choose hormone therapy for the management of systemic menopause symptoms. Choosing the product that is the "best fit" for each individual woman can be a challenging task. One of these decisions pertains to the optimal route of estrogen administration. This practice pearl will explore some of the differences between oral and transdermal estrogens.

### Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: Endometrial hyperplasia and irregular bleeding [^117T4GoG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The decline in circulating oestrogen around the time of menopause often induces unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone replacement therapy (both unopposed oestrogen and oestrogen-progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms. In women with an intact uterus, unopposed oestrogen may induce endometrial stimulation and increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The addition of progestogen reduces this risk but may cause unacceptable symptoms, bleeding, and spotting, which can affect adherence to therapy.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review is to assess which hormone replacement therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma with a low rate of abnormal vaginal bleeding.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2003), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003), Contents (1993 to January 2003), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2002), Social Sciences Index (1980 to January 2003), PsycINFO (1972 to February 2003), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2003). The search strategy was developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorder and Subfertility Group. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data. In most cases, the corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^113PdyLb]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to combine the natural hormones 17β-estradiol (estradiol) and progesterone in a single-dose form to treat menopause symptoms while providing endometrial protection would be clinically useful. A comprehensive search suggests that no single drug combining these two hormones has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A product that combines 17β-estradiol with progesterone and offers good bioavailability of both hormones is difficult to achieve biochemically. Progesterone has poor bioavailability — it is highly lipophilic and undergoes a complex metabolic process, making it difficult to administer orally or transdermally. Administering clinically effective oral doses of estradiol and progesterone together in a formulation that does not compromise the bioavailability of either hormone is challenging because of differences in their structure and solubility.

Many compounding pharmacies manufacture products that combine estrogen and progesterone. Considering the poor bioavailability of oral and transdermal progesterone and the difficulty in determining the appropriate ratio of progesterone to estradiol, compounded hormone products should be viewed with caution. Pharmacokinetic studies of products manufactured by compounding pharmacies, with the aim to ensure adequate bioavailability, are rarely performed. Few clinical trials have appropriately evaluated the safety and efficacy of compounded hormones. For example, despite the widespread use of custom-compounded progesterone gels and creams, no evidence exists to show that any of them effectively opposes estradiol.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^112oDMni]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

One limitation of the study is that analysis of breast density changes with E2/P4 was not a prespecified endpoint in the REPLENISH study. Increased breast density is often found in women using hormone therapy (HT) containing a progestin. Greater breast density may be associated with increased breast cancer risk, although it is unknown whether the elevated breast cancer risk by combined HT is mediated through hormone-induced breast density change. Another limitation of the study is the relatively short duration time for observations of breast changes. As a longer duration of combined hormone use is associated with higher breast cancer risk, our study is likely not sufficiently powered to observe long-term breast safety of TX-001HR (in addition to the low incidence of breast cancer in women of similar age). Nevertheless, this duration is typical in evaluating menopausal hormone medications, and the study suggests short-term breast safety of TX-001HR.

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) with the two highest doses of TX-001HR studied, with favorable safety profiles including endometrial protection, pharmacologically effective absorption, improved quality of life and sleep outcomes, and no adverse effects on cardiometabolic markers. The results reported here suggest that the TX-001HR, an FDA-approved bioidentical combined HT, is potentially safe with no significant adverse impact on the breast after 1 year of use.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^116XyXTU]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

The endometrial histology was reported in 20 randomized controlled trials of menopausal women who used various doses and durations of vaginal estrogen creams, tablets, inserts, or rings. Multiple products were utilized in some studies. From a total of 2,983 unique women exposed to vaginal estrogen products for up to 1 year (with 66 women exposed to multiple doses), 1 case of endometrial cancer (0.03%) and 12 cases of hyperplasia (0.4%, including a case of hyperplasia in an endometrial polyp) were detected.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^113BpQZB]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to the FDA-approved vaginal estrogen creams currently on the market, such as Premarin® (0.625 mg/g) and Estrace® 0.01% (0.1 mg/g), estradiol 0.003% provides a lower vaginal dose of 30 μg/g (15 μg/0.5g in this study) per application. This dosage is similar to the lower dose vaginal estradiol tablets currently available in the US (10–25 μg/tablet) and aligns with FDA and NAMS recommendations to use the lowest effective vaginal estrogen dose for VVA treatment to reduce systemic exposure.

Many postmenopausal women with VVA using prescription estrogen treatment report concerns over long-term safety, hormone exposure, and general side effects, which may negatively impact medication adherence. Furthermore, local application of low-dose estrogen may be an appropriate treatment for some women who have moderate-severe VVA where systemic absorption of estrogen might present greater risks than benefits.

Treatment with the estradiol cream was well tolerated, as indicated by the similar rates of TEAEs and related discontinuations between the two treatment groups. One exception is that vulvovaginal mycotic infections were more frequent in the estradiol group. This finding was not unexpected and may reflect the impact of estrogen on decreasing vaginal pH, a shift in the vaginal biome, or a direct effect of estrogen on candida species. No serious TEAEs were considered treatment-related or led to discontinuations, and no deaths occurred.

### Continuous combined hormone replacement therapy and risk of endometrial cancer [^1131Tek3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2000). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal women who receive sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month over a prolonged period may have an elevated risk of endometrial cancer relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. This study investigated whether the daily use of estrogen and progestogen (continuous combined hormone replacement therapy) could diminish any excess risk of endometrial cancer.

- **Study design**: A population-based study in Washington State obtained interview data from 969 women aged 45 to 74 years with endometrial cancer diagnosed during 1985 through 1991 or 1994 through 1995 and from 1325 age-matched control subjects selected primarily by random digit dialing. Women who had received only continuous combined hormone replacement therapy were compared with women who had only received another hormone replacement therapy regimen or who had never received hormone replacement therapy.

- **Results**: The risk of endometrial cancer among users of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (n = 9 case patients, n = 33 control subjects) relative to women who had never received hormone replacement therapy was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3–1.3); the risk relative to women who received hormone replacement that included progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month was 0.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.2–1.1). Most continuous combined hormone replacement therapy use was short-term (< 72 months) or recent (in the previous 24 months).

Women who had received continuous combined hormone replacement therapy for several years did not appear to show an increased risk of endometrial cancer compared to those who had never received hormone replacement therapy or who had received other hormone replacement regimens.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: A critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^114EhXYn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the interpretation of subgroup effects note that "debates about subgroup effects may be framed in terms of absolute acceptance or rejection", but such "yes versus no polarized approach is undesirable and destructive, mainly because it ignores the uncertainty that is inevitably part of such judgments". Furthermore, "an approach that is more productive and more realistic is to place the likelihood that a subgroup effect is real on a continuum from 'highly plausible' to 'extremely unlikely' ". The question is then a decision of where on this continuum a putative subgroup effect lies. We propose the subgroup effect first suggested in the PROMISE trial and then confirmed in the PRISM trial is highly plausible.

More than two million women in the United States are estimated to use vaginal estrogen products to treat symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Because most women do not use vaginal estrogens with concomitant progestogen, examining the impact of unopposed vaginal estrogens on the endometrium is an important safety parameter. Although it is well accepted that local unopposed vaginal estrogens do not have the same stimulatory effects on the endometrium as unopposed oral estrogens, the association between vaginal estrogen use and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer has not been systematically reviewed in published studies. A systematic review of the published clinical evidence to examine the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogens would enhance future development of novel, safe, and effective low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women in the published medical literature.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1121KrKa]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

The variation in estradiol and progesterone levels observed in compounded HT formulations justifies concerns regarding risks due to variability. These concerns have been outlined by NAMS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the US FDA in their statements regarding compounded hormone use. These data support the need to develop a US FDA-approved bioidentical HT for women who prefer bioidentical hormones, including up to 3 million women using unregulated, compounded HT annually in the United States.

### Estrogel [^116Rk1LU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider the addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. However, in some cases, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may require a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen alone, or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically, as clinically appropriate, to determine if treatment is still necessary.

- **Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause**: EstroGel 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the single approved dose for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. The lowest effective dose of EstroGel 0.06% for this indication has not been determined. Before using the canister for the first time, it must be primed. Remove the large canister cover and fully depress the pump five times. Discard the unused gel by thoroughly rinsing it down the sink or placing it in the household trash. After priming, the pump is ready to use. The recommended area of application is the arm. Apply a thin layer over the entire arm, on the inside and outside, from wrist to shoulder.

### Prevention strategies in endometrial carcinoma [^115ApTb3]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up data provides convincing evidence that the use of combined oral contraceptives (COC) is associated with a significant and enduring reduction in the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer. Iversen et al. demonstrate that the protective effects of COC persist for at least 30 years in this updated follow-up study of users who were recruited between 1968 and 1969. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health advises that at a BMI greater than 35 kg/m², the risks of COC are likely to outweigh the benefits, which precludes its use as chemoprevention in the most obese women.

- **Hormonal treatment**: Oral, injectable, and intrauterine progestin use has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Data from the Finnish Cancer Registry showed a standardized incidence ratio of 0.46 for endometrial cancer in users of the LNG-IUS. The NOWAC study was a Norwegian population-based prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 12.5 years; 9% of the cohort reported LNG-IUS use during or prior to 1998–2007. After adjusting for BMI, activity, age at start of follow-up, combined oral contraceptive use, menopausal status, and parity, ever-users of LNG-IUS had a relative risk of endometrial cancer of 0.34 (95% CI 0.18–0.65) compared with never-users.

Almost 25 years ago, the harmful effects of unopposed estrogen HRT in women with a uterus were apparent. Sequential HRT has also been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, with risk being inversely proportional to the number of days progestin is given. Continuous combination has not been shown to increase risk.

### Using progestins in clinical practice [^115GU4nS]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Progestational agents have many important functions, including the regulation of the menstrual cycle, treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, prevention of endometrial cancer and hyperplastic precursor lesions, and contraception. Because of the reported side effects of synthetic analogs called "progestins", there has been interest in replicating the natural hormone for clinical use.

Natural progesterone is obtained primarily from plant sources and is currently available in injectable, intravaginal, and oral formulations. An oral micronized progesterone preparation has improved bioavailability and fewer reported side effects compared with synthetic progestins. Adolescents and perimenopausal women may require progestational agents for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding resulting from anovulatory cycles. These agents may also be used in women at risk for endometrial hyperplasia because of chronic unopposed estrogen stimulation.

Progestin-only contraceptives can be used in women with contraindications to estrogen; however, efficacy requires rigorous compliance. New progestins for use in combination oral contraceptive pills were specifically developed to reduce androgenic symptoms. It is unclear whether these progestins increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease. Progestin-only emergency contraception offers a regimen that is more effective than combination oral contraceptive pills, with fewer reported side effects.

### Progesterone [^112zDhVs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Please read this information carefully before you start to use Progesterone Injection and each time your prescription is renewed, in case anything has changed. This leaflet does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. If you still have any questions, ask your doctor or health-care provider.

Progesterone Injection is a sterile injectable solution containing the natural female hormone called progesterone. It is indicated for the treatment of amenorrhea (absence of menses in women who have previously had a menstrual period) and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance.

Progesterone is one of the hormones essential for regular menstrual periods. If your doctor has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own, Progesterone Injection may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need. When you do not produce enough progesterone, menstrual irregularities can occur. Progesterone Injection can provide you with the progesterone needed during a normal menstrual cycle.

The following possible side effects have been reported with Progesterone Injection. Consult your doctor if you experience any of the side effects mentioned below, or other side effects:

- **If you experience sleepiness**: Do not drive or operate machinery.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^112qkhjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Effects on the endometrium**: In a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women aged between 45 and 64 years, participants were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 119), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only (n = 119), or 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen plus cyclic MPA (n = 118). Results demonstrated a reduced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in the treatment group receiving 10 mg MPA plus 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens compared to the group receiving 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens only.

In a second 1-year study, 832 postmenopausal women aged between 45 and 65 years were treated with daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen (days 1–28) plus either 5 mg cyclic MPA or 10 mg cyclic MPA (days 15–28), or daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only. The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic MPA plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

### Estradiol and progesterone bioavailability for moderate to severe vasomotor symptom treatment and endometrial protection with the continuous-combined regimen of TX-001HR (oral estradiol and progesterone capsules) [^113jmok2]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, very high oral doses of crystalline P4 were needed to achieve biological effects due to low absorption. Better absorption was achieved with micronized P4 particles suspended in an oil-based formulation. Creating a product that combines E2 and P4 in a single oral pill has been challenging because of the differing structures and solubilities of E2 and P4, which could have resulted in poor P4 bioavailability. The unique formulation of TX-001HR allows E2/P4 to be combined in a single softgel capsule while retaining pharmacologically effective absorption of both E2 and P4, as shown in this report.

The REPLENISH trial is the first randomized controlled trial powered to detect endometrial hyperplasia, showing that continuous daily use of oral 100 mg P4 with 0.5 or 1 mg E2 can protect postmenopausal women from endometrial hyperplasia. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that sequential use of oral 200 mg P4 for 12 to 14 days each cycle may offer protection against estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia.

- **Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial**: This was the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential protective effect of P4 on the endometrium from estrogen-induced stimulation. While the PEPI study was not fully powered to demonstrate endometrial protection, women taking 200 mg P4 cyclically for 12 days plus 0.625 mg CEE for up to 36 months had rates of endometrial hyperplasia similar to that of placebo.

Conversely, two European observational studies — the Etude Epidémiologique Auprès de Femmes de l'Education Nationale (E3N) and…

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^112Bwetc]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Authors of a systematic literature search for RCTs evaluating compounded progesterone cream for vasomotor symptoms found three RCTs, none of which applied the FDA methodology for assessing endometrial safety. A few observational studies and surveys offered low-level evidence that CBHT improved menopausal symptoms, but most consolidated results for all CBHT used, ignoring differences in hormones, doses, and delivery methods.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies published over the last 15 years (1987–2002), as well as meta-analyses and reviews that may have included earlier literature.

The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies containing a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects noted in the Women's Health Initiative, such as reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials using different estrogen/progestin combinations. However, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density — an excellent predictor of fracture risk — with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^113i2HST]. Menopause (2019). High credibility.

Vaginal conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) creams, including both conjugated equine estrogen cream and synthetic conjugated estrogens-A cream, were evaluated in 1,064 women across eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Doses ranged from 0.3 to 1.25 mg, with treatment durations spanning from 2 to 52 weeks.

In a 24-week study, CEEs cream at 2 g (equivalent to 1.25 mg of CEE) was applied daily by 79 women for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break. Out of 28 women with sufficient tissue biopsies at 24 weeks, two cases (7.1%) of endometrial hyperplasia were identified: one case of simple hyperplasia without atypia (3.6%) and one case of complex hyperplasia without atypia (3.6%). No endometrial cancers were detected.

In other studies, there were no reported instances of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with various CEE cream regimens: daily 1.25 mg CEE cream for 3 weeks (n = 7), 1.25 mg CEE cream three times weekly for 12 weeks (n = 67), and 0.625 mg CEE cream daily for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly application for 10 weeks (n = 26). A 12-week study comparing synthetic conjugated estrogens-A 1.25 mg (n = 161) or 0.625 mg (n = 150) to placebo also reported no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

Two studies used 0.625 mg CEE cream in women awaiting hysterectomy. In one study, participants received the CEE cream daily for 2 weeks prior to hysterectomy (n = 150), resulting in two cases of simple hyperplasia (1.3%). In a similar trial lasting 4 to 8 weeks, involving the use of 0.625 mg CEE vaginally inserted for 2 weeks and then twice weekly before hysterectomy for vaginal wall prolapse (n = 8), no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer were reported.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^111zbUzT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone are principal hormones in a woman's life. Before menopause, women are exposed to regularly varying levels of endogenous estrogens and progesterone during repeated menstrual cycles and potentially to sustained levels of these hormones during pregnancy. Reproductive-age women may also be exposed to these hormones via oral contraceptives, which are composed of a progestin with or without an estrogen, and other forms of hormonal contraception. Near or after menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) — estrogen alone or combined with a progestin — may be offered to mitigate menopausal symptoms arising from precipitous declines in endogenous estrogen production and to reduce the risk of bone fractures.

Women with prior use of oral contraceptive pills show a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Despite the intended medical effects and additional health benefits, these hormonal agents, specially estrogens, continue to raise concerns for breast cancer risk.

In this review, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between estrogens and breast cancer. Given the expansive scope of scientific investigations pertaining to this topic, we focused on findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses with rigor and a large sample size, as well as preclinical mechanistic studies. To be inclusive on the topic with depth, we examined vast evidence, via extensive searches on PubMed, from clinical and basic experimental studies, which include hormonal contraceptives and HRT.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60.

More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of three ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results.

The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for five or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Salivary, but not serum or urinary levels of progesterone are elevated after topical application of progesterone cream to pre-and postmenopausal women [^117N77iA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

Use of topically applied micronized ('natural') progesterone as a substitute for synthetic estrogens and progestogen preparations is controversial. This study aimed to examine the changes in blood and salivary concentrations of progesterone following a single topical application of a progesterone cream.

- **Patients and measurements**: We investigated six premenopausal women in the luteal phase and six postmenopausal women to determine the short-term changes in serum, urinary, and salivary progesterone concentrations following a single 64 mg topical application of micronized progesterone.

- **Results**: Serum progesterone concentrations did not increase during the first 3 hours after the application of progesterone cream; however, salivary values rose significantly in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, consistent with the view that progesterone is absorbed and transported through the body. Salivary progesterone concentrations were significantly elevated above basal levels by 30–60 minutes and reached peak levels at 1–4 hours, with mean levels approximately fivefold higher in premenopausal than in menopausal women.

- **Conclusions**: Salivary progesterone measurements confirm that topically applied progesterone is absorbed, despite the lack of change in serum progesterone concentrations. However, at the dose administered, serum progesterone levels do not reach those observed after oral or vaginally delivered progesterone preparations. Higher doses may be required to induce biological responses within the endometrium.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: a systematic evidence review [^112XndL3]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Abstracts were independently reviewed by four reviewers who initially determined from the title/abstract if the article met eligibility criteria for full-text review. This included studies using vaginal estrogens in menopausal women for any reason, such as vulvar and vaginal atrophy, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Endometrial histology was required to identify cases of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia, except for larger cohort studies where incidence rates were reported. Citations were included for full-text review if it was unclear from the abstract whether endometrial histologic data were reported, including data on endometrial cancer, hyperplasia, or proliferation.

From the full-text review, primary studies were eligible for review if they reported endometrial histology data obtained from a biopsy in menopausal women using vaginal estrogens, or incidence of endometrial cancer and/or hyperplasia in larger cohort studies. Articles were excluded if they reported no use of vaginal estrogen, use of vaginal ring with a progestogen, exclusive use of estriol or other non-US-approved estrogen, no endometrial histology, or unrelated content. General reviews, editorials, abstracts of studies now fully published, or duplicate publications were also excluded. However, no studies reporting endometrial histology in women using vaginal estrogens were excluded.

### Endometrial safety and bleeding profile of a 17β-estradiol/progesterone oral softgel capsule (TX-001HR) [^113TpLk5]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated endometrial protection and favorable amenorrhea rates for all four doses of TX-001HR, an E2/P4 single-dose softgel capsule, when used to treat moderate to severe VMS in menopausal women with a uterus. This is the first time that E2 and P4 have been combined in a single capsule for continuous use. After one year of TX-001HR use, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was less than 1%, demonstrating that endometrial protection, as defined by the FDA, was accomplished with the P4 component of TX-001HR. The high rates of cumulative amenorrhea with 1 mg E2/100 mg P4 make it a good therapeutic option for postmenopausal women seeking treatment for moderate to severe VMS and those who may be concerned about bleeding and bleeding-associated malignancy risks.

The data showing that oral TX-001HR did not cause endometrial stimulation are noteworthy because this is the first time dosages of 50 and 100 mg of P4 were shown to inhibit the stimulatory effects of E2 when taken continuously in a properly powered and randomized controlled trial. In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial, women taking individual capsules of 200 mg of micronized P4 cyclically 12 days out of a 28-day cycle with 0.625 mg of continuous conjugated equine estrogens had a risk of hyperplasia not different than the placebo group. Although the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial was longer than the REPLENISH trial, it was not powered to show an increase in endometrial hyperplasia risk.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^111Z7DXd]. Menopause (2018). High credibility.

This study was performed in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for good clinical practice and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, parts 50, 56, and 312. The protocol was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards, and all participants provided written informed consent.

- **Study design**: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in postmenopausal women reporting dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. Once screening and baseline assessments were completed, participants were randomized (1:1) to estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% (15 μg estradiol; 0.5 g cream) or placebo cream (0.5 g of cream). During the 2-week initial treatment period, estradiol and placebo creams were applied vaginally every day for 2 weeks to rapidly maximize vaginal response. Dosages for both treatments were then reduced to three maintenance applications per week for 10 weeks. After completion of the 12-week trial, those participants who had an intact uterus at baseline were provided a progestin for 14 days; the type and dose of progestin were determined by the investigator.

### Efficacy of progestin-only treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms: a systematic review [^116Uevcw]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with bothersome symptoms for many women, including mood changes, hot flushes, sleep problems, and fatigue. Progesterone is commonly prescribed in combination with estrogen therapy. Although monotherapy with progestins has been used as a treatment for menopausal symptoms in women with contraindications to estrogens, the optimal route and dosage of progestin monotherapy have not been established.

- **Objective**: To assess whether progestin as a standalone treatment is effective for treating vasomotor and mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Evidence review**: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Embase databases from January 1980 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated different forms of progestin for the treatment of vasomotor or mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Findings**: A systematic search of 892 studies identified seven RCTs involving a total of 601 patients. The available literature was heterogeneous in terms of formulation and dose of progesterone; administration ranged from 5 to 60 mg of transdermal progesterone, 10 to 20 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone. Duration of treatment also differed between studies, ranging from 21 days to 12 months (median: 12 weeks). Three of seven RCTs reported that progestin therapy led to an improvement in vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women. The largest study administering oral progestin using 300 mg micronized progesterone reported a 58.9% improvement in VMS compared to 23.5% in the placebo group.
