## Question

treatment for crps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for CRPS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging using validated criteria. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of interdisciplinary functional restoration. Next, I will examine mechanism-based pharmacotherapy, followed by rehabilitation strategies and psychological interventions. After that, I need to review interventional options and escalation thresholds. I should also consider special populations, prevention, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and uncertainties, ensuring I double-check claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease, because treatment hinges on accurate classification and timing. I should apply the Budapest Criteria endorsed by IASP, recognizing that CRPS is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and that ancillary tests are used to rule out mimics rather than to confirm CRPS itself, so I need to check for red flags suggesting alternative diagnoses before committing to CRPS-specific therapy [^112EvsTU] [^1126uchP]. Hold on, I should verify staging assumptions: the traditional three sequential stages are not supported empirically, but distinguishing warm (likely inflammatory) versus cold (likely chronic, non-inflammatory) phenotypes and noting early versus persistent disease can guide prognosis and therapy selection, so I will document these features without overcommitting to rigid stages [^113xKcLq] [^117VgrTT]. I should also track severity over time using the CRPS Severity Score to quantify change, since a change of about 5 points is considered clinically meaningful and helps monitor response to therapy [^116uJrV5].

> Next, I should review the foundational principle: interdisciplinary functional restoration is the cornerstone of CRPS care. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: interdisciplinary programs with coordinated, team-based care are preferred; if unavailable, a coordinated multidisciplinary approach is acceptable, but unimodal care is inadequate for this multifactorial syndrome [^116BE912] [^112TcZ29]. I need to ensure the team includes physical and occupational therapy, psychology, and pain medicine, with regular meetings to adjust the plan, because functional gains are as critical as pain reduction and often drive long-term outcomes [^115zewxQ].

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy, but I should confirm that no single drug cures CRPS and that mechanism-based, time-sensitive choices are prudent. Bisphosphonates have the most consistent signal for early CRPS-I, with randomized data for neridronate showing large, sustained pain reductions and functional benefits; I should consider IV bisphosphonates early, especially in warm presentations, while acknowledging that long-term disability effects remain less certain and that adverse events are more frequent than placebo in pooled analyses [^113i5n6s] [^111YC6Mw] [^114AeX7B]. Ketamine has a plausible role for refractory pain, but I should double-check the evidence quality: systematic reviews conclude the data are mostly low quality, so ketamine remains a bridge or rescue strategy rather than first-line, and I should monitor closely for adverse effects and abuse potential [^112fRjsA]. For neuropathic pain features, I can extrapolate from general neuropathic pain evidence to consider gabapentinoids, TCAs, or SNRIs, but I must be transparent that CRPS-specific RCTs are sparse and that I should trial one agent at a time to effect, then switch if ineffective or poorly tolerated [^112pjk8P] [^112e8fP9]. NSAIDs may help myofascial or peri-limb pain but have not shown clear benefit for core CRPS pain, so I will not rely on them for primary CRPS analgesia [^116Hc5ZC].

> Let me consider rehabilitation strategies next, and I should confirm the strength of evidence. Graded motor imagery and mirror therapy show the most promising signals for pain and function in small RCTs, but the certainty is very low, so I will integrate them within a broader functional program and set expectations accordingly [^1142ugw3] [^115eHqmY]. Exposure-based physiotherapy targeting pain-related fear and learned disuse has RCT-level support for reducing disability and pain catastrophizing, so I should prioritize graded exposure to feared activities alongside conventional PT/OT to restore range of motion, strength, and desensitization, while avoiding pain-contingent protective strategies that reinforce disuse [^1172gBQ6] [^111sAcG1]. Hold on, I should verify that multimodal PT has only shown small, uncertain benefits on disability at 12 months in one trial, so I will frame PT as essential for function but not as a standalone pain cure [^1142ugw3].

> Psychological interventions are integral, and I need to ensure I address both education and comorbidities. Early, structured education about CRPS, the harm of disuse, and the need for active self-management reduces fear-avoidance and improves engagement; I should also screen for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and catastrophizing because these predict worse outcomes and can derail rehabilitation [^116Ze8Rn] [^112nJPef]. Cognitive-behavioral strategies and acceptance-based approaches can reduce pain-related fear and improve functioning, and although CRPS-specific RCTs are limited, general chronic pain evidence and preliminary CRPS data support their inclusion in care plans [^1112Cafn] [^114xgQbn]. I should double-check that relaxation-based adjuncts may help with autonomic features, but they are not substitutes for active rehabilitation and exposure work [^114aZi3S].

> Now, I should review interventional options and the escalation thresholds. Sympathetic blocks have been historically used, but I must not jump to conclusions: Cochrane reviews consistently find no convincing benefit of local anesthetic sympathetic blockade over placebo or other active treatments, so I will reserve them for diagnostic purposes or as adjuncts when rehabilitation is stalled, rather than as routine therapy [^1149oNZ4] [^111CMc6s]. For refractory cases beyond 12–16 weeks of optimized conservative care, spinal cord stimulation has the best randomized evidence for short-term pain reduction and improved global perceived effect, though effect sizes are modest and long-term durability varies; I should counsel on risks, costs, and the need for ongoing rehabilitation even after implantation [^114fwHAc] [^114mftjV]. Motor cortex stimulation is a last-resort option for intractable cases after SCS failure, and I need to ensure a trial period precedes permanent implantation given invasiveness and limited high-quality data [^1153Yi81].

> But wait, what about special populations and prevention. In pediatrics, I should confirm that most cases are CRPS-I and that prognosis is generally favorable with intensive PT and CBT; delays to diagnosis are common, so early, coordinated rehabilitation with family education is key, and I should avoid unnecessary invasive procedures [^1135o3uq] [^114DHJAs] [^113a7XNk]. For prevention after wrist fractures, vitamin C has conflicting evidence, with an older meta suggesting benefit and a newer RCT showing no benefit or harm, so I should individualize and not overpromise prophylaxis [^1154hnBE]. I need to ensure that any preventive strategy is framed within risk–benefit discussions and shared decision-making, especially given the low absolute risk of CRPS after fractures [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and outcome assessment, and I need to ensure I use validated tools. The CRPS Severity Score provides a practical, clinic-friendly way to track changes across sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor, and trophic domains, and a change of about 5 points is clinically meaningful; I should pair this with functional measures and patient-reported pain, disability, and psychological constructs to guide iterative adjustments [^116uJrV5] [^113sbvjV]. Hold on, I should verify that dichotomous diagnostic criteria alone are insufficient for longitudinal care; continuous severity tracking better captures clinically relevant change and supports mechanism-based adjustments over time [^116uJrV5].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence and expert consensus. Early disease (within 6–18 months) warrants immediate interdisciplinary functional restoration, early education, and consideration of bisphosphonates if warm/inflammatory features predominate, while using gabapentinoids or TCAs/SNRIs for neuropathic features and integrating graded motor imagery or mirror therapy within PT; I should set pre-agreed functional and pain targets and reassess at defined intervals to avoid therapeutic inertia [^112e8fP9] [^1142ugw3]. Persistent disease (> 12–18 months) requires intensified psychological support for fear-avoidance and disuse, continuation of graded exposure-based rehabilitation, and rational pharmacologic rotation; if refractory after 12–16 weeks of optimized care, I should discuss SCS as a next step, maintaining rehabilitation throughout [^111sAcG1] [^114mftjV]. Throughout, I must avoid overpromising cures, emphasize self-management, and continuously screen for mimics or evolving comorbidities that could alter management [^112e8fP9].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and evidence gaps so we do not overstate conclusions. High-certainty evidence for CRPS treatments remains sparse; most pharmacologic and rehabilitation signals are low to very low certainty, and even SCS evidence, while positive, is modest in magnitude and limited in scope, so shared decision-making and expectation management are essential [^111YC6Mw] [^114fwHAc]. Let me reconsider the role of mechanism-based subtyping: warm versus cold phenotypes and early versus persistent disease likely influence response to specific interventions, but formal subtyping is not yet standard, so I will use these distinctions heuristically while participating in registries and research to advance precision care [^117VgrTT] [^115oyAyQ]. Until larger, high-quality RCTs are completed, interdisciplinary functional restoration remains the most defensible, patient-centered approach, with pharmacologic and interventional therapies tailored to phenotype, stage, and evolving mechanisms [^111NsCXg] [^116BE912].

---

CRPS treatment is best managed with a **multidisciplinary approach** [^111NsCXg] that prioritizes **early functional restoration** [^116BE912] and **mechanism-based pharmacotherapy** [^112dKriF]. The most effective options include **bisphosphonates for early-stage CRPS** [^113i5n6s] [^114rAhwc], **ketamine for refractory pain** [^112fRjsA] [^1157nqF7], and **spinal cord stimulation for chronic, refractory cases** [^114fwHAc] [^114mftjV]. Physical therapy with graded motor imagery [^111YC6Mw] and mirror therapy [^115eHqmY] improves pain and function, while psychological therapies (CBT, ACT) address fear-avoidance and coping [^111sAcG1] [^114xgQbn]. Sympathetic blocks are not first-line [^1149oNZ4] and should be reserved for select cases [^115zewxQ]. Early diagnosis and **individualized care** are critical to outcomes [^1126uchP] [^112vDcn8].

## Pharmacological treatments

Key characteristics of bisphosphonates and ketamine:

| **Aspect** | **Bisphosphonates** | **Ketamine** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Inhibit osteoclast activity and reduce inflammatory mediators [^114AeX7B] | NMDA antagonist reducing central sensitization [^notfound] |
| Evidence | Strong for early CRPS-I; neridronate RCT showed durable pain relief and functional gains [^113i5n6s] [^1173MsAR] [^114e15K3] | Moderate for refractory pain; IV ketamine provides short-term relief [^116kbCE1] |
| Clinical use | Preferred for early-stage CRPS-I; consider IV formulations in acute cases [^113i5n6s] [^114e15K3] | Short infusions for severe, refractory cases; monitor for psychotomimetic effects [^notfound] |

---

### Neuropathic pain medications

Among neuropathic pain medications, **gabapentin and pregabalin** have limited CRPS-specific evidence but are commonly used for neuropathic pain [^112pjk8P]; **tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** may help neuropathic pain and comorbid mood symptoms [^112e8fP9]; and **serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)** likewise have limited CRPS-specific data but are used for neuropathic pain [^1157nqF7].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids may reduce neurogenic inflammation; **short courses can help acute flares**, though long-term use is limited by adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Interventional procedures

### Spinal cord stimulation (SCS)

Spinal cord stimulation modulates pain pathways via electrical stimulation [^notfound]. Evidence from randomized trials shows **SCS reduces pain and improves function in refractory CRPS** [^114mftjV]. Clinically, it is indicated for chronic, refractory cases after conservative care fails [^114mftjV].

---

### Sympathetic nerve blocks

Sympathetic nerve blocks modulate sympathetic outflow; however, **evidence is limited and mixed**, with Cochrane reviews showing no consistent benefit [^1149oNZ4] [^111CMc6s]. They may be considered for select refractory cases, but not as first-line therapy [^115zewxQ].

---

## Physical and occupational therapy

- **Graded motor imagery (GMI)**: Improves pain and function in CRPS-I [^115eHqmY].
- **Mirror therapy**: Benefits post-stroke CRPS-I; evidence growing for other CRPS [^115eHqmY].
- **Exposure-based therapy**: Reduces pain-related fear and disability [^111sAcG1] [^1172gBQ6].
- **General PT/OT**: Essential for mobility, strength, and function; early active rehabilitation is key [^117KorhH] [^115zewxQ].

---

## Psychological interventions

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Reduces pain, distress, and disability; targets fear-avoidance [^111sAcG1] [^113WXjs3].
- **Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)**: Enhances acceptance and coping, improving quality of life [^114xgQbn] [^112nJPef].
- **Education**: Early education on self-management and activity is critical [^116Ze8Rn] [^113WXjs3].

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Early data suggest benefit in autoimmune subsets [^notfound].
- **Low-dose naltrexone (LDN)**: Under study for neuroinflammation modulation [^1157nqF7].
- **Botulinum toxin**: Small studies suggest potential in refractory cases [^1157nqF7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Early, **multidisciplinary care** with functional restoration is recommended [^116BE912] [^114LE4W4]. Treatment should be **individualized** based on stage, phenotype, and patient factors [^111Kqk8F] [^112vDcn8]. Evidence remains limited; many recommendations are based on low-quality data and expert consensus [^111YC6Mw] [^1113hYR8].

---

## Summary of evidence-based treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Bisphosphonates | High | First-line for early CRPS-I |
| Ketamine | Moderate | Short-term use in refractory cases |
| SCS | Moderate | Chronic, refractory CRPS |
| GMI/Mirror therapy | Moderate | Adjunctive rehabilitation |
| CBT/ACT | Moderate | Psychological support |
| Sympathetic blocks | Low | Selective cases only |
| IVIG/LDN | Low | Experimental; research settings |

---

CRPS management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^111NsCXg] that integrates pharmacotherapy, rehabilitation, and psychological care, with treatment tailored to disease stage and patient characteristics. Early diagnosis and **individualized care** are essential to optimize outcomes [^1126uchP].

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 4th edition [^114K7xdp]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This is the fourth edition of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy).

Methods

Expert practitioners in each discipline traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS systematically reviewed the available and relevant literature; due to the paucity of levels 1 and 2 studies, less rigorous, preliminary research reports were included. The literature review was supplemented with knowledge gained from extensive empirical clinical experience, particularly in areas where high-quality evidence to guide therapy is lacking.

Results

The research quality, clinical relevance, and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail with an eye to the expert practitioner in each therapeutic area. Levels of evidence are mentioned when available, so that the practitioner can better assess and analyze the modality under discussion, and if desired, to personally consider the citations. Tables provide details on characteristics of studies in different subject domains described in the literature.

Conclusions

In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case-by-case analysis of the risk/cost vs benefit analysis, the authors offer these "practical" guidelines.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112vDcn8]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating painful state of an extremity that can develop after trauma. CRPS is diagnosed by the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS. The syndrome is characterized by continuing regional pain with abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, edema, and/or trophic signs. The clinical presentation of CRPS can be very heterogeneous because CRPS is a multi-mechanism syndrome. Therefore, mechanism-based subgroups have been suggested to personalize treatment for CRPS. Additionally, the presentation of symptom pain may also be able to identify different subgroups of CRPS. In this review, the types of pain recognized by the IASP-nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain-will be discussed as possible subgroups for CRPS. Each pain type should be identified in CRPS patients, with a thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests or (novel) biomarkers to optimize treatment effectiveness. Over the course of the syndrome, patients with CRPS probably experience more than one distinct pain type. Therefore, pain specialists should be alert to not only adjust their treatment if underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms tend to change but also to personalize the treatment of the associated type of pain in the CRPS patient.

### Physiotherapy for pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II [^1142ugw3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition that usually manifests in response to trauma or surgery and is associated with significant pain and disability. CRPS can be classified into two types: type I (CRPS I) in which a specific nerve lesion has not been identified and type II (CRPS II) where there is an identifiable nerve lesion. Guidelines recommend the inclusion of a variety of physiotherapy interventions as part of the multimodal treatment of people with CRPS. This is the first update of the review originally published in Issue 2, 2016.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for treating pain and disability associated with CRPS types I and II in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, PEDro, Web of Science, DARE and Health Technology Assessments from February 2015 to July 2021 without language restrictions, we searched the reference lists of included studies and we contacted an expert in the field. We also searched additional online sources for unpublished trials and trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapy interventions compared with placebo, no treatment, another intervention or usual care, or other physiotherapy interventions in adults with CRPS I and II. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were composite scores for CRPS symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), patient global impression of change (PGIC) scales and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened database searches for eligibility, extracted data, evaluated risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE system.

Main Results

We included 16 new trials (600 participants) along with the 18 trials from the original review totalling 34 RCTs (1339 participants). Thirty-three trials included participants with CRPS I and one trial included participants with CRPS II. Included trials compared a diverse range of interventions including physical rehabilitation, electrotherapy modalities, cortically directed rehabilitation, electroacupuncture and exposure-based approaches. Most interventions were tested in small, single trials. Most were at high risk of bias overall (27 trials) and the remainder were at 'unclear' risk of bias (seven trials). For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as very low, downgraded due to serious study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Included trials rarely reported adverse effects. Physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS I One trial (135 participants) of multimodal physiotherapy, for which pain data were unavailable, found no between-group differences in pain intensity at 12-month follow-up. Multimodal physiotherapy demonstrated a small between-group improvement in disability at 12 months follow-up compared to an attention control (Impairment Level Sum score, 5 to 50 scale; mean difference (MD) -3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.13 to -0.27) (very low-certainty evidence). Equivalent data for pain were not available. Details regarding adverse events were not reported. Physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS II We did not find any trials of physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS II.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physiotherapy interventions on pain and disability in CRPS. This conclusion is similar to our 2016 review. Large-scale, high-quality RCTs with longer-term follow-up are required to test the effectiveness of physiotherapy-based interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with CRPS I and II.

### Physiotherapy for pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II [^115eHqmY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition that usually manifests in response to trauma or surgery. When it occurs, it is associated with significant pain and disability. It is thought to arise and persist as a consequence of a maladaptive pro-inflammatory response and disturbances in sympathetically-mediated vasomotor control, together with maladaptive peripheral and central neuronal plasticity. CRPS can be classified into two types: type I (CRPS I) in which a specific nerve lesion has not been identified, and type II (CRPS II) where there is an identifiable nerve lesion. Guidelines recommend the inclusion of a variety of physiotherapy interventions as part of the multimodal treatment of people with CRPS, although their effectiveness is not known.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for treating the pain and disability associated with CRPS types I and II.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from inception up to 12 February 2015: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, PEDro, Web of Science, DARE and Health Technology Assessments, without language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapy interventions for treating pain and disability in people CRPS. We also searched additional online sources for unpublished trials and trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of physiotherapy interventions (including manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, electrotherapy, physiotherapist-administered education and cortically directed sensory-motor rehabilitation strategies) employed in either a stand-alone fashion or in combination, compared with placebo, no treatment, another intervention or usual care, or of varying physiotherapy interventions compared with each other in adults with CRPS I and II. Our primary outcomes of interest were patient-centred outcomes of pain intensity and functional disability.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated those studies identified through the electronic searches for eligibility and subsequently extracted all relevant data from the included RCTs. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments and rated the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (739 participants) that tested the effectiveness of a broad range of physiotherapy-based interventions. Overall, there was a paucity of high quality evidence concerning physiotherapy treatment for pain and disability in people with CRPS I. Most included trials were at 'high' risk of bias (15 trials) and the remainder were at 'unclear' risk of bias (three trials). The quality of the evidence was very low or low for all comparisons, according to the GRADE approach. We found very low quality evidence that graded motor imagery (GMI; two trials, 49 participants) may be useful for improving pain (0 to 100 VAS) (mean difference (MD) -21.00, 95% CI -31.17 to -10.83) and functional disability (11-point numerical rating scale) (MD 2.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.48), at long-term (six months) follow-up, in people with CRPS I compared to usual care plus physiotherapy; very low quality evidence that multimodal physiotherapy (one trial, 135 participants) may be useful for improving 'impairment' at long-term (12 month) follow-up compared to a minimal 'social work' intervention; and very low quality evidence that mirror therapy (two trials, 72 participants) provides clinically meaningful improvements in pain (0 to 10 VAS) (MD 3.4, 95% CI -4.71 to -2.09) and function (0 to 5 functional ability subscale of the Wolf Motor Function Test) (MD -2.3, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.72) at long-term (six month) follow-up in people with CRPS I post stroke compared to placebo (covered mirror). There was low to very low quality evidence that tactile discrimination training, stellate ganglion block via ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy compared to placebo, and manual lymphatic drainage combined with and compared to either anti-inflammatories and physical therapy or exercise are not effective for treating pain in the short-term in people with CRPS I. Laser therapy may provide small clinically insignificant, short-term, improvements in pain compared to interferential current therapy in people with CRPS I. Adverse events were only rarely reported in the included trials. No trials including participants with CRPS II met the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available data show that GMI and mirror therapy may provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function in people with CRPS I although the quality of the supporting evidence is very low. Evidence of the effectiveness of multimodal physiotherapy, electrotherapy and manual lymphatic drainage for treating people with CRPS types I and II is generally absent or unclear. Large scale, high quality RCTs are required to test the effectiveness of physiotherapy-based interventions for treating pain and disability of people with CRPS I and II. Implications for clinical practice and future research are considered.

### Interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome-an overview of systematic reviews [^111YC6Mw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that usually occurs in a limb following trauma or surgery. It is characterised by persisting pain that is disproportionate in magnitude or duration to the typical course of pain after similar injury. There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal management of CRPS, although a broad range of interventions have been described and are commonly used. This is the first update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2013.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of any intervention used to reduce pain, disability, or both, in adults with CRPS.

Methods

We identified Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews through a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, PEDro, LILACS and Epistemonikos from inception to October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that included adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with CRPS, using any diagnostic criteria. Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews and certainty of the evidence using the AMSTAR 2 and GRADE tools respectively. We extracted data for the primary outcomes pain, disability and adverse events, and the secondary outcomes quality of life, emotional well-being, and participants' ratings of satisfaction or improvement with treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We included six Cochrane and 13 non-Cochrane systematic reviews in the previous version of this overview and five Cochrane and 12 non-Cochrane reviews in the current version. Using the AMSTAR 2 tool, we judged Cochrane reviews to have higher methodological quality than non-Cochrane reviews. The studies in the included reviews were typically small and mostly at high risk of bias or of low methodological quality. We found no high-certainty evidence for any comparison. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may reduce pain intensity post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.8 to -3.4, P = 0.001; I² = 81%; 4 trials, n = 181) and moderate-certainty evidence that they are probably associated with increased adverse events of any nature (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.47; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 168.0; 4 trials, n = 181). There was moderate-certainty evidence that lidocaine local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade probably does not reduce pain intensity compared with placebo, and low-certainty evidence that it may not reduce pain intensity compared with ultrasound of the stellate ganglion. No effect size was reported for either comparison. There was low-certainty evidence that topical dimethyl sulfoxide may not reduce pain intensity compared with oral N-acetylcysteine, but no effect size was reported. There was low-certainty evidence that continuous bupivacaine brachial plexus block may reduce pain intensity compared with continuous bupivacaine stellate ganglion block, but no effect size was reported. For a wide range of other commonly used interventions, the certainty in the evidence was very low and provides insufficient evidence to either support or refute their use. Comparisons with low- and very low-certainty evidence should be treated with substantial caution. We did not identify any RCT evidence for routinely used pharmacological interventions for CRPS such as tricyclic antidepressants or opioids.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite a considerable increase in included evidence compared with the previous version of this overview, we identified no high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of any therapy for CRPS. Until larger, high-quality trials are undertaken, formulating an evidence-based approach to managing CRPS will remain difficult. Current non-Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions for CRPS are of low methodological quality and should not be relied upon to provide an accurate and comprehensive summary of the evidence.

### Pharmacologic treatment of complex regional pain syndrome I: a conceptual framework [^116mAMtd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Pain may be a leading symptom in complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I) and may hinder functional recovery. In this case, a pharmacotherapeutic approach to pain should be part of the individually tailored interdisciplinary treatment regimen. However, operational criteria for determining which patient may profit from what therapeutic intervention are lacking. This article discusses a conceptual framework in which the rapid progress made in basic pain research may contribute to the clinical management of pain in CRPS I. First, recent insights in the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CRPS I are reviewed. CRPS I is considered a neuropathic pain syndrome with a mixed and time-dependent profile of a regional inflammation, sensitization of primary somatosensory afferents (peripheral sensitization), and sensitization of spinal neurons (central sensitization). The dominant mechanisms may vary across individual patients with different time profiles. Second, a model was constructed in which signs and symptoms in an individual patient are related to these mechanisms. Finally, relating the clinical picture to the underlying pathophysiology may help determine the pharmacotherapeutic approach for an individual patient. Pharmacologic options are discussed in this context. The presented framework does not aim to provide an evidence-based treatment algorithm, ready to be used in daily clinical practice; rather it offers a crude, first step toward a mechanism-based pharmacotherapy in CRPS I, in an effort to shift from a mainly empirical treatment paradigm toward theory-driven treatment procedures.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111NsCXg]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare pain disorder that usually occurs in a limb after trauma. The features of this disorder include severe pain and sensory, autonomic, motor, and trophic abnormalities. Research from the past decade has offered new insights into CRPS epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Early identification of individuals at high risk of CRPS is improving, with several risk factors established and some others identified in prospective studies during the past 5 years. Better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS has led to its classification as a chronic primary pain disorder, and subtypes of CRPS have been updated. Procedures for diagnosis have also been clarified. Although effective treatment of CRPS remains a challenge, evidence-based integrated management approaches provide new opportunities to improve patient care. Further advances in diagnosis and treatment of CRPS will require coordinated, international multicentre initiatives.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^117NzziS]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare, chronic pain disorder. It is challenging for patients and physicians because it leads to significant morbidity due to chronic pain that may last for years. CRPS typically develops four to six weeks after direct trauma, such as an injury or surgery, and causes pain that is out of proportion to the inciting injury. It is associated with multiple physiologic mechanisms, affecting skin texture or localized sensory, motor, sudomotor, and vasomotor pathways. The diagnosis is made clinically using standardized diagnostic criteria. Ancillary testing is not necessary for the diagnosis of CRPS but can be useful to rule out alternative diagnoses. There are two types of CRPS, type 1 and type 2, although treatment is the same for both. There is no single proven treatment modality for CRPS, and there have been no large randomized controlled studies of CRPS treatments. Most treatments are based on studies of their use for other types of neuropathic pain. The mainstay of treatment is to improve function of the affected body part and to decrease pain; therefore, treatment requires multiple modalities, including medications, behavioral health interventions, and referral to a pain specialist.

### The therapeutic approach to complex regional pain syndrome: light and shade [^114ouDez]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly painful, limb-confined condition that usually arises after a trauma although its causes remain unknown. It is associated with a particularly poor quality of life, and considerable healthcare and societal costs. Its distinct combination of abnormalities includes limb-confined inflammation and tissue hypoxia, sympathetic dysregulation, small fibre damage, serum autoantibodies, central sensitisation and cortical reorganisation, which place it at the crossroads of disciplines including rheumatology, pain medicine and neurology. The significant scientific and clinical advances made over the past 10 years promise an improved understanding of the causes of CRPS, and for more effective treatments. This review summarises the currently available treatments. The therapeutic approach is multidisciplinary, and involves educating patients about the condition, sustaining or restoring limb function, reducing pain, and providing psychological support. This paper describes the systemic drug treatments, grouped on the basis of their real or presumed antinociceptive mechanisms and reported actions without making any formal distinction between CRPS types I and II.

### Mechanism-based treatment in complex regional pain syndromes [^112dKriF]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) are multifactorial disorders with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. Management of CRPS is challenging, partly because of a lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of the various therapies, and partly because successful treatment of CRPS requires a multidisciplinary, patient-tailored approach. The pain in CRPS is often described as typical 'burning' neuropathic pain, and is accompanied by a variety of sensory, motor and autonomic signs and symptoms. Because research into therapies specifically in CRPS has been scarce, treatment for these syndromes has been largely based on therapeutic strategies adapted from neuropathic pain states; however, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of CRPS has provided the opportunity to develop mechanism-based treatments. The interactions between the multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development, progression and maintenance of CRPS remain poorly understood. This Review describes the challenges in linking the current theories and knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms to the mode of actions of the different treatment approaches. We discuss the current treatment strategies for CRPS, including pharmacotherapy, sympathetic ganglion block interventions, psychological support, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and establish the concept of mechanism-based treatment for CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome in adults [^112HatbE]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly painful, limb-confined condition, which arises usually after trauma. It is associated with a particularly poor quality of life, and large health-care and societal costs. The causes of CRPS remain unknown. The condition's distinct combination of abnormalities includes limb-confined inflammation and tissue hypoxia, sympathetic dysregulation, small fibre damage, serum autoantibodies, central sensitization and cortical reorganization. These features place CRPS at a crossroads of interests of several disciplines including rheumatology, pain medicine and neurology. Significant scientific and clinical advances over the past 10 years hold promise both for an improved understanding of the causes of CRPS, and for more effective treatments. This review summarizes current concepts of our understanding of CRPS in adults. Based on the results from systematic reviews, treatment approaches are discussed within the context of these concepts. The treatment of CRPS is multidisciplinary and aims to educate about the condition, sustain or restore limb function, reduce pain and provide psychological intervention. Results from recent randomized controlled trials suggest that it is possible that some patients whose condition was considered refractory in the past can now be effectively treated, but confirmatory trials are required. The review concludes with a discussion of the need for additional research.

The Rationale for Functional Restoration

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome bio-medically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features (and thus, critical treatment targets). The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment. To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known; evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis (see above); and, moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined (here) as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable (but more accessible) is multidisciplinary treatment (a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties).

Many patients with CRPS experience refractory pain that significantly restricts their daily activities. Although a range of therapeutic interventions, including pharmacological, procedural, and rehabilitative therapy, have been explored, pain management is often suboptimal. Effective management requires a comprehensive understanding of CRPS pathophysiology and the available treatment modalities.

This review explores the underlying mechanisms of CRPS and highlights non-invasive treatment approaches — pharmacological and rehabilitative — aiming to support clinical decision-making and improve symptom management. The following sections present the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS, pharmacological treatments, and rehabilitative treatment approaches for managing the condition.

Introduction

This is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS; also known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy [RSD], causalgia). These guidelines have been sponsored by the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association and are written by expert practitioners in each discipline that is traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS. There is a fairly recent, excellent, rigorous systematic review of the treatment literature in CRPS which confirmed there is only modest high-quality research in the area. Nonetheless, in this "evidence vacuum" we still have a responsibility to treat. Certainly, we must develop better evidence, but our patients cannot wait for that. Thus, although the authors of these practical guidelines all utilized a systematic approach to reviewing the available and relevant literature, they have also included less rigorous, preliminary research reports, often supplemented by extensive empirical experience. The authors perforce must also extrapolate from "related conditions" (e.g. neuropathy). The research quality, clinical relevance and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail. Where there have been no discernable updates in areas since the 4th edition, text from that has been kept, sometimes verbatim.

These guidelines are intended to serve as an aid to the informed practitioner. They are not intended to replace or supplant the clinician's best judgment, experience, training and/or a careful consideration of the clinical context. Although every reasonable attempt has been made to minimize the bias of the authors, it must be recalled that, in context, all the experts are to a degree biased to "their" therapeutic approach.

Detailed sections are provided as a guide and informational source not only to the "expert" in CRPS therapy but also the primary practitioner who is interested. Levels of evidence are mentioned when appropriate (Table 1), so that the practitioner can better assess the modality under discussion and, if desired, to personally review the citations in detail. In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case by case analysis of the risk/cost versus benefit analysis, we offer these "practical" guidelines.

It is critical to identify and aggressively treat all spheres of the pain experience. Obsessing with only the biomedical sphere often dooms the clinician and patient to failure, especially in chronic CRPS. Psychological factors and comorbidity are equally important, often modifiable, treatment targets in CRPS and can help ensure optimal outcomes (detailed below). The psychological spheres of the pain experience can now be identified through the many psychometric, quantified measures that have been created and that have demonstrated efficacy in psychological assessment.

Psychological features are sometimes critically important diagnostic components to identify and aggressively treat. Subjective but quantifiable psychometric scores are also often employed as secondary outcomes in research. CRPS is not a psychological disorder, however, and it is therefore usually illogical to designate psychometric outcomes as primary benchmarks of improvement in CRPS treatment. Thus, solely treating psychological aspects of a patient's CRPS is also doomed to fail. Both pain intensity and the psychological sequelae/co-morbidities of pain are recognized, fundamental elements in understanding the whole patient, yet the subjective character of these elements and their measurement deem them less suitable for research or for interpreting clinical outcomes. Applying interventions solely as a means of trying to reduce pain ratings is a strategy that is equally doomed to fail. More objective clinical benchmarks and outcomes should be identified if possible — standards upon which clinical decisions may be made and success may be measured. Thus, ideally, treatment of CRPS should rely upon an intuitive, measurable, and step-wise functional restoration algorithm as the pivotal feature of treatment of CRPS.

Functional restoration has historically and empirically been considered a critical and necessary component of interdisciplinary pain management programs for CRPS. This contention has been codified by two large international consensus-building conferences. Baron and Wasner concluded that physiotherapy is "of utmost importance", and Birklein et al. argued that rehabilitation techniques should always be employed for the "obvious reasons" outlined in these manuscripts. In a Dutch multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline for treatment of CRPS, physical therapy is reported to have beneficial effect with regard to functional restoration and ability to cope with the complaint, and therefore should form a part of the standard treatment for CRPS. Furthermore, the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) has concluded that physical functioning is a "core domain" in the assessment of pain treatment efficacy, second only to pain assessment.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^111Kqk8F]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a syndrome that is initiated by trauma to an extremity. This results in continuous regional pain that is disproportionate to the extent and healing of the trauma. Besides continuous pain, patients have additional clinical signs such as disturbed blood flow or abnormal sudomotor activity, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes in the affected CRPS extremity. CRPS is a clinical diagnosis based on the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS, that were validated in 2010 and adopted by the IASP in 2012. Nowadays, CRPS is considered a multi-mechanism syndrome, and the experienced continuous pain can be linked to mechanisms such as inflammation, vasomotor disturbances, and peripheral and central sensitization. The presentation of symptoms and signs of CRPS patients can be heterogeneous, because a combination of the underlying mechanisms may be more prominent. Rather than a one-size-fits-all treatment approach, pain specialists nowadays specifically determine the most prominent underlying mechanism(s). These mechanisms are targeted with different pharmacologic treatment categories in order to improve treatment efficacy.

To personalize the management of CRPS, several subgroups have been suggested. The subgroups CRPS type 1 (without nerve lesion) and CRPS type 2 (with nerve lesion) are recognized by the IASP. In addition, different subgroups have been proposed based on clinical presentation (warm/cold), syndrome duration (early/persistent), and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (peripheral/centraland florid/sensory/vasomotor). Recently, our research group suggested creating subgroups on the mechanisms that are targeted by the pharmacotherapeutic options for CRPS: 1) inflammation; 2) peripheral and central sensitization; 3) vasomotor disturbances and 4) motor disturbances. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet on which classification of CRPS subtypes is best to use.

Different presentations of symptom pain in CRPS can potentially also identify possible subgroups of CRPS that require a distinct treatment strategy. The IASP recognizes nociceptive (tissue damage), neuropathic (nerve injury), and nociplastic pain (sensitized nervous system) as distinct pain types driven by different mechanisms. In this article, we describe a strategy to phenotype CRPS patients based on the three types of chronic pain defined by the IASP because this classification affects the work-up and treatment decisions in chronic pain. Diagnostic tests and biomarkers are developed for nociceptive and neuropathic pain. However, especially to differentiate nociplastic pain, diagnostic tests have to be further developed.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^113Nnjxb]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating painful state of an extremity that can develop after trauma. CRPS is diagnosed by the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS. The syndrome is characterized by continuing regional pain with abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, edema, and/or trophic signs. The clinical presentation of CRPS can be very heterogeneous because CRPS is a multi-mechanism syndrome. Therefore, mechanism-based subgroups have been suggested to personalize treatment for CRPS. Additionally, the presentation of symptom pain may also be able to identify different subgroups of CRPS. In this review, the types of pain recognized by the IASP―nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain―will be discussed as possible subgroups for CRPS. Each pain type should be identified in CRPS patients, with a thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests or (novel) biomarkers to optimize treatment effectiveness. Over the course of the syndrome, patients with CRPS probably experience more than one distinct pain type. Therefore, pain specialists should be alert to not only adjust their treatment if underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms tend to change but also to personalize the treatment of the associated type of pain in the CRPS patient.

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^1126uchP]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Most frequently, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) develops after a trauma and affects distal parts of the limbs. Early recognition and initiation of adequate treatment is crucial for a favorable outcome. On the other hand, misdiagnosing other disorders as CRPS is detrimental because more appropriate treatment may be withheld from the patients. Despite intensive research, a specific biomarker or paraclinical measure for CRPS diagnosis is still lacking. Instead, clinical criteria approved by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and latest adapted in 2019 are central for diagnosing CPRS. Thus, the CRPS diagnosis remains challenging with the risk of a "deliberate diagnosis" for unexplained pain, while at the same time a delayed CRPS diagnosis prevents early treatment and full recovery. CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. To clinically diagnose CRPS, a vigorous exclusion of "other diseases that would better explain the signs and symptoms" are needed before the patients should be referred to tertiary centers for specific pain treatment. We highlight red flags that suggest "non-CRPS" limb pain despite clinical similarity to CRPS. Clinical and neurological examination and paraclinical evaluation of a probably CRPS patient are summarized. Finally, we pinpoint common differential diagnoses for CRPS. This perspective might help CRPS researchers and caregivers to reach a correct diagnosis and choose the right treatment, regardless whether for CRPS mimics or CRPS itself.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review for the practising clinician [^113G4YeL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a life-altering condition that usually affects the extremities after a trauma or nerve injury. The physiologic changes that occur as a result of the inciting injury are complex, as the name of the syndrome implies. The pain and disability associated with CRPS often lead to psychological co-morbidities that create a vicious cycle of pain, isolation, and depression. We review recent developments in the understanding of CRPS and advancements in management of this syndrome. Further research in targeting specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of CRPS should lead to prevention of this condition.

### Intravenous therapies for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^112fRjsA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains a challenging clinical pain condition. Multidisciplinary approaches have been advocated for managing CRPS. Compared with spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal targeted therapy, IV treatments are less invasive and less costly. We aimed to systemically review the literature on IV therapies and determine the level of evidence to guide the management of CRPS. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane databases for articles published on IV therapies of CRPS up through February 2015. The search yielded 299 articles, of which 101 were deemed relevant by reading the titles and 63 by reading abstracts. All these 63 articles were retrieved for analysis and discussion. We evaluated the relevant studies and provided recommendations according to the level of evidence. We conclude that there is evidence to support the use of IV bisphosphonates, immunoglobulin, ketamine, or lidocaine as valuable interventions in selected patients with CRPS. However, high-quality studies are required to further evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of IV therapies for CRPS.

### An update on the pathophysiology of complex regional pain syndrome [^111RMqDg]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a neuropathic pain disorder with significant autonomic features. Few treatments have proven effective, in part, because of a historically poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disorder. CRPS research largely conducted during the past decade has substantially increased knowledge regarding its pathophysiologic mechanisms, indicating that they are multifactorial. Both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms are involved. These include peripheral and central sensitization, inflammation, altered sympathetic and catecholaminergic function, altered somatosensory representation in the brain, genetic factors, and psychophysiologic interactions. Relative contributions of the mechanisms underlying CRPS may differ across patients and even within a patient over time, particularly in the transition from "warm CRPS" (acute) to "cold CRPS" (chronic). Enhanced knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CRPS increases the possibility of eventually achieving the goal of mechanism-based CRPS diagnosis and treatment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: a comprehensive and critical review [^1117hQko]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a term used to describe a variety of disorders characterized by spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain that is disproportional to the inciting event and accompanied by a myriad of autonomic and motor disturbances in highly variable combinations. There are no standards which can be applied to the diagnosis and would fulfill definitions of evidence-based medicine. Indeed, there are almost as many diagnostic criteria as there are names to this disorder. The umbrella term CRPS has been subdivided into type I and type II. CRPS I is intended to encompass reflex sympathetic dystrophy and similar disorders without a nerve injury; while CRPS II occurs after damage to a peripheral nerve. There are numerous etiological pathophysiological events that have been incriminated in development of CRPS, including inflammation, autoimmune responses, abnormal cytokine production, sympathetic-sensory disorders, altered blood flow and central cortical reorganization. However, the number of studies that have included appropriate controls and have sufficient numbers of patients to allow statistical analysis with appropriate power calculations is vanishingly small. This has led to over-diagnosis and often excessive pharmacotherapy and even unnecessary surgical interventions. In this review we provide a detailed critical overview of not only the history of CRPS, but also the epidemiology, the clinical features, the pathophysiological studies, the proposed criteria, the therapy and, in particular, an emphasis that future research should apply more rigorous standards to allow a better understanding of CRPS, i.e. what it is, if it is, and when it is.

### Recommendations for a first core outcome measurement set for complex regional PAin syndrome clinical sTudies (COMPACT) [^113sbvjV]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a persistent pain condition that remains incompletely understood and challenging to treat. Historically, a wide range of different outcome measures have been used to capture the multidimensional nature of CRPS. This has been a significant limiting factor in the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms and management of CRPS. In 2013, an international consortium of patients, clinicians, researchers, and industry representatives was established, to develop and agree on a minimum core set of standardised outcome measures for use in future CRPS clinical research, including but not limited to clinical trials within adult populations. The development of a core measurement set was informed through workshops and supplementary work, using an iterative consensus process. "What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS, and what factors influence it?" was agreed as the most pertinent research question that our standardised set of patient-reported outcome measures should be selected to answer. The domains encompassing the key concepts necessary to answer the research question were agreed as follows: pain, disease severity, participation and physical function, emotional and psychological function, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and patient's global impression of change. The final core measurement set included the optimum generic or condition-specific patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures, which captured the essence of each domain, and 1 clinician-reported outcome measure to capture the degree of severity of CRPS. The next step is to test the feasibility and acceptability of collecting outcome measure data using the core measurement set in the CRPS population internationally.

Diagnosis

Historically, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) has been referred to by many names, with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) and Causalgia the best known. Both terms are sometimes still used inappropriately, and there are no validated diagnostic criteria for either. The historical evolution of terms and diagnostic criteria for CRPS is interesting and colorful but is beyond the scope of this review. Interested readers are referred to the prior version of this review for a more detailed history.

The label CRPS originated at an international conference held in Orlando, Florida, in 1994 that led to the first consensus-based diagnostic criteria for CRPS adopted by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). These 1994 IASP criteria for CRPS were necessary and important, yet experience gained from developing and systematically improving diagnostic criteria for headache and psychiatric disorders highlighted the necessity of validating and modifying such preliminary consensus-based criteria through systematic validation research. To this end, a series of validation studies were conducted, leading ultimately to an empirically derived set of CRPS criteria (the so-called Budapest Criteria) that were adopted formally by the IASP committee on taxonomy as the new IASP criteria in 2012 (Table 2). The fact that the clinical presentation of CRPS (and its underlying mechanisms) can differ between patients and even within a patient over time made development of validated and clinically useful criteria somewhat more challenging. The results of these diagnostic validation studies are now briefly reviewed to detail the rationale for the format and content of the 2012 revised IASP criteria.

Psychological Interventions

Clinicians who work with CRPS patients recognize that successful management of the syndrome presents a significant challenge. In the absence of any definitive medical treatment the need for interdisciplinary management of CRPS has been emphasized as above. It is now generally agreed that successful treatment must simultaneously address the medical, psychological, and social aspects of the syndrome. As will be described below, there are several reasons why addressing psychological and behavioral factors may be crucial to successful treatment in patients with CRPS. A rationale for use of psychological interventions in the management of CRPS will first be described. The treatment outcome literature regarding efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS will then be presented, followed by a brief overview of relevant meta-analytic literature regarding efficacy of such interventions for non-CRPS chronic pain conditions. Finally, an overview of clinical recommendations for psychological care of CRPS patients based on both research literature and clinical experience will be presented.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^113WF6BT]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pain experienced by CRPS patients should be differentiated between nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain to optimize the management of CRPS. Pain should be seen as a continuum in which nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain can shift over the course of the syndrome due to a change in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS. Precision medicine―by subgrouping CRPS patients based on history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing on the most prominent pain type―may tailor a more specific and effective treatment for individual CRPS patients.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112Wp6UJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hence, the aim of this narrative review is threefold: 1) to describe the types of pain in CRPS and link these pain types to pathophysiological underlying mechanisms in CRPS; 2) to explain how these pain types can be differentiated by history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests; 3) to illustrate how these pain types can be specifically targeted to optimize treatment effectiveness. Ultimately, a personalized treatment plan should be made for each CRPS patient. For this purpose, the differentiation of symptom pain in nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain may be an additional helpful tool to optimize the management of CRPS.

CRPS Stages? CRPS Subtypes?

Is CRPS a uniform phenomenon across individuals, or are there distinct subtypes and/or stages of the syndrome? This issue of diagnostic heterogeneity, addressing whether or not patient presentations (i.e. the overall pattern of CRPS signs and symptoms) tend to be similar across individuals, may have significant implications for both prognosis and treatment. Historically, three progressive stages of CRPS have been cited as important in identifying and treating the syndrome (e.g.), but empirical studies indicate that the existence of such sequential stages is clinical lore and is an unsubstantiated theory based on certain authors' clinical experience rather than an outcome of specific scientific study (level 4). Statistical analysis (cluster analysis) to identify CRPS patient subgroups based on presence of similar patterns of clinical features has failed to support the traditional sequential staging of CRPS (level 2). When patients are assigned into three subgroups based on similarity of CRPS features, pain duration is similar across the groups, unlike what would be expected if the traditional sequential stages of CRPS were valid. Results of the first such study, for example, identified distinct patient subgroups characterized by: (1) a relatively limited syndrome with vasomotor signs predominating, (2) a relatively limited syndrome with neuropathic pain/sensory abnormalities predominating, and (3) a florid CRPS syndrome with a wide array of CRPS features similar to "classic RSD" descriptions. Both studies addressing this issue found statistical evidence for this latter, more severe CRPS patient subgroup.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^113QkBjh]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by an exaggerated response to an initial stimulus, accompanied by autonomic, sensory, motor, and sudomotor dysfunctions. Recognized as a systemic disorder, CRPS involves complex interactions among inflammatory, immunologic, neurogenic, genetic, and psychological factors. The primary mechanisms include peripheral and central sensitization, sympathetic nervous system dysregulation, and altered somatosensory processing. However, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear, contributing to ongoing debate about optimal treatment approaches. Management typically involves a multimodal approach. Pharmacologic options such as corticosteroids, ketamine, and bisphosphonates have demonstrated relative safety and efficacy in clinical practice. Moreover, rehabilitation therapies -including cortically directed sensorimotor rehabilitation, range-of-motion or aerobic exercises, exposure therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and thermal therapy -serve as valuable nonpharmacologic interventions. No consensus currently exists on standardized treatment protocols for CRPS, particularly regarding the choice of non-invasive approaches. In this context, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for guiding appropriate management strategies. This review provides updated insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, alongside a synthesis of evidence-based non-invasive treatment, to support mechanism-driven clinical decision-making, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

Background

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a challenging and often disabling condition marked by persistent pain, most commonly in a limb following injury or surgery. It presents with a wide array of symptoms, including intense pain, swelling, alterations in skin color and temperature, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes such as skin and tissue atrophy. While the precise cause of CRPS is not fully understood, it is thought to stem from abnormal nervous system activity, leading to heightened pain sensitivity and inflammatory responses. A thorough understanding of CRPS is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and enhancing patients' quality of life. Although attempts have been made to distinguish between acute and chronic CRPS, there are currently no established diagnostic criteria specific to chronic CRPS in medical literature.

Objective

This ASIPP guidance document offers updated, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Chronic Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), with a primary focus on introducing novel, time-based diagnostic criteria specific to the chronic phase. These proposed criteria address significant gaps in the current literature, where existing standards, such as the Budapest Criteria, do not sufficiently differentiate between the acute and chronic stages of the condition.

An expert panel convened by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) conducted a comprehensive literature review and employed a structured consensus process to develop recommendations. Acknowledging that the clinical and pathological characteristics of CRPS change significantly beyond 12 months, the panel proposed chronic-specific diagnostic criteria based on disease duration, clinical history, physical examination findings, and optional diagnostic tests. These draft criteria were refined through multidisciplinary input and expert consensus.

Results

The diagnostic framework for chronic CRPS consists of four key components:General Criteria - Require fulfillment of the Budapest Criteria for at least 12 months, continued recognition of CRPS as a diagnosis of exclusion, and differentiation from generalized nociplastic pain syndromes. History-Based Criteria - Mandate the presence of at least three out of five specific historical features. Physical Examination Criteria - Include asymmetric limb findings, sensory disturbances, and musculoskeletal changes. Optional Diagnostic Testing - May involve assessments such as intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and imaging evidence of regional bone demineralization. This framework builds upon the Budapest Criteria by incorporating time-dependent features of chronic CRPS, including musculoskeletal dystrophy, neurogenic inflammation, and sympathetic dysfunction. Emerging objective tools-such as quantitative sensory testing (QST), skin biopsy for IENFD, functional MRI, and serum biomarkers of neuroinflammation-may further support diagnosis in complex or uncertain cases. Treatment recommendations highlight a multimodal strategy that integrates physical rehabilitation, pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain, sympathetic nerve blocks, and advanced neuromodulation. Emphasis is placed on individualized care pathways tailored to disease stage and patient-specific characteristics.

Conclusions

This article presents the first structured, time-sensitive diagnostic criteria for chronic CRPS, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy and informing treatment strategies. Adoption of these criteria may enhance clinical outcomes and promote further research into the natural history and pathophysiology of CRPS progression.

### Proposed new diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome [^116XCY5u]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This topical update reports recent progress in the international effort to develop a more accurate and valid diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The diagnostic entity of CRPS (published in the International Association for the Study of Pain's Taxonomy monograph in 1994; International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP]) was intended to be descriptive, general, and not imply etiopathology, and had the potential to lead to improved clinical communication and greater generalizability across research samples. Unfortunately, realization of this potential has been limited by the fact that these criteria were based solely on consensus and utilization of the criteria in the literature has been sporadic at best. As a consequence, the full potential benefits of the IASP criteria have not been realized. Consensus-derived criteria that are not subsequently validated may lead to over- or underdiagnosis, and will reduce the ability to provide timely and optimal treatment. Results of validation studies to date suggest that the IASP/CRPS diagnostic criteria are adequately sensitive; however, both internal and external validation research suggests that utilization of these criteria causes problems of overdiagnosis due to poor specificity. This update summarizes the latest international consensus group's action in Budapest, Hungary to approve and codify empirically validated, statistically derived revisions of the IASP criteria for CRPS.

### A prospective, multisite, international validation of the complex regional pain syndrome severity score [^114hCkZE]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a dichotomous (yes/no) categorization, a format necessary for clinical decision making. Such dichotomous diagnostic categories do not convey an individual's subtle gradations in the severity of the condition over time and have poor statistical power when used as an outcome measure in research. This prospective, international, multicenter study slightly modified and further evaluated the validity of the CRPS Severity Score (CSS), a continuous index of CRPS severity. Using a prospective design, medical evaluations were conducted in 156 patients with CRPS to compare changes over time in CSS scores between patients initiating a new treatment program and patients on stable treatment regimens. New vs stable categorizations were supported by greater changes in pain and function in the former. Results indicated that CSS values in the stable CRPS treatment group exhibited much less change over time relative to the new treatment group, with intraclass correlations nearly twice as large in the former. A calculated smallest real difference value revealed that a change in the CSS of ≥ 4.9 scale points would indicate real differences in CRPS symptomatology (with 95% confidence). Across groups, larger changes in CRPS features on the CSS over time were associated in the expected direction with greater changes in pain intensity, fatigue, social functioning, ability to engage in physical roles, and general well-being. The overall pattern of findings further supports the validity of the CSS as a measure of CRPS severity and suggests it may prove useful in clinical monitoring and outcomes research.

### Rational pain management in complex regional pain syndrome 1 (CRPS 1) – a network meta-analysis [^114e15K3]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) 1 advocate several substance classes to reduce pain and support physical rehabilitation, but guidance about which agent should be prioritized when designing a therapeutic regimen is not provided. Using a network meta-analytic approach, we examined the efficacy of all agent classes investigated in randomized clinical trials of CRPS 1 and provide a rank order of various substances stratified by length of illness duration.

Design

In this study a network meta-analysis was conducted.

Patients

The participants of this study were patients with CRPS 1.

Method

Searches in electronic, previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and the reference lists of relevant articles were performed. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing at least one analgesic agent with placebo or with another analgesic and reporting efficacy in reducing pain. Summary efficacy stratified by symptom duration and length of follow-up was computed across all substance classes. Two authors independently extracted data.

Results

In total, 16 studies were included in the analysis. Bisphosphonates appear to be the treatment of choice in early stages of CRPS 1. The effects of calcitonin surpass that of bisphosphonates and other substances as a short-term medication in more chronic stages of the illness. While most medications showed some efficacy on short-term follow-up, only bisphosphonates, NMDA analogs, and vasodilators showed better long-term pain reduction than placebo.

Limitation

For some drug classes, only a few studies were available and many studies included a small group of patients. Insufficient data were available to analyze efficacy on disability.

Conclusion

This network meta-analysis indicates that a rational pharmacological treatment strategy of pain management should consider bisphosphonates in early CRPS 1 and a short-term course of calcitonin in later stages. While most medications showed some efficacy on short-term follow-up, only bisphosphonates, NMDA analogs and vasodilators showed better long-term pain reduction than placebo.

### Clinical features and pathophysiology of complex regional pain syndrome [^1156nUnX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

A complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) — multiple system dysfunction, severe and often chronic pain, and disability — can be triggered by a minor injury, a fact that has fascinated scientists and perplexed clinicians for decades. However, substantial advances across several medical disciplines have recently improved our understanding of CRPS. Compelling evidence implicates biological pathways that underlie aberrant inflammation, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity in the clinical features of CRPS. Collectively, the evidence points to CRPS being a multifactorial disorder that is associated with an aberrant host response to tissue injury. Variation in susceptibility to perturbed regulation of any of the underlying biological pathways probably accounts for the clinical heterogeneity of CRPS.

### A systematic review of ketamine for complex regional pain syndrome [^1125SP3B]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This systematic review aims to examine the available literature and to synthesize published data concerning the treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) with ketamine.

Methods

The search was conducted utilizing the databases Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. All relevant articles were systematically reviewed.

Results

The search yielded 262 articles, 45 of which met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of those included, 6 were reviews, 5 were randomized placebo-controlled trials, 13 were observational studies, and 21 were case reports.

Conclusion

There is no high quality evidence available evaluating the efficacy of ketamine for CRPS and all manuscripts examined in this review were of moderate to low quality. Therefore, we conclude there is currently only weak evidence supporting the efficacy of ketamine for CRPS, yet there is clearly a rationale for definitive study.

### Interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome [^116kbCE1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is currently no strong consensus regarding the optimal management of complex regional pain syndrome although a multitude of interventions have been described and are commonly used.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of the effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention used to reduce pain, disability or both in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Methods

We identified Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews through a systematic search of the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and PEDro. We included non-Cochrane systematic reviews where they contained evidence not covered by identified Cochrane reviews. The methodological quality of reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. We extracted data for the primary outcomes pain, disability and adverse events, and the secondary outcomes of quality of life, emotional well being and participants' ratings of satisfaction or improvement. Only evidence arising from randomised controlled trials was considered. We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included six Cochrane reviews and 13 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. Cochrane reviews demonstrated better methodological quality than non-Cochrane reviews. Trials were typically small and the quality variable. There is moderate quality evidence that intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine is not effective in CRPS and that the procedure appears to be associated with the risk of significant adverse events. There is low quality evidence that bisphosphonates, calcitonin or a daily course of intravenous ketamine may be effective for pain when compared with placebo; graded motor imagery may be effective for pain and function when compared with usual care; and that mirror therapy may be effective for pain in post-stroke CRPS compared with a 'covered mirror' control. This evidence should be interpreted with caution. There is low quality evidence that local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade is not effective. Low quality evidence suggests that physiotherapy or occupational therapy are associated with small positive effects that are unlikely to be clinically important at one year follow up when compared with a social work passive attention control. For a wide range of other interventions, there is either no evidence or very low quality evidence available from which no conclusions should be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a critical lack of high quality evidence for the effectiveness of most therapies for CRPS. Until further larger trials are undertaken, formulating an evidence-based approach to managing CRPS will remain difficult.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^117KorhH]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

This paper provides a review of the current concepts of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and current diagnostic criteria are presented. Etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of painful disorders, previously addressed as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) remain doubtful.

Issues

The supposition of a sympathetic hyperactivity in the development of this syndrome could not be confirmed. Up to now no diagnostic test that would be specific for the diagnosis of CRPS is available. The diagnosis relies on clinical findings and the exclusion of conditions that could account for the degree of pain and dysfunction. Pain relief and functional restoration are the primary goals of all therapeutic intervention and should start as early as possible.

Challenge 3: defining subtypes of CRPS

Just as there is controversy regarding subtyping CRPS into types 1 and 2, based on the presence or absence of significant neural damage as described above, so is there little consensus on staging CRPS according to duration or severity. At one time CRPS was empirically staged according to specific characteristics that occurred in a suggested time-frame (Table 4). This staging provided at best only very limited prognostic information on a small group of patients with very severe CRPS and has not been found to be clinically useful in the majority. Other suggested ways of subtyping CRPS have been examined but not achieved universal acceptance. The CRPS severity score provides grading of severity of CRPS but cutoff scores for various outcome measures have not yet been established.

In clinical practice it is hard to predict the outcome at first presentation in any one patient with CRPS. It is also hard to predict response to different treatment interventions and hence to predict overall prognosis in CRPS. Certain age groups, such as adolescents, seem to have better and more positive predictive outcomes than others. In general, early diagnosis and early intervention with a variety of strategies, including education, psychological support, and mobilization, remain a hallmark of standard care. Additionally, early intervention with evidence-based treatments will improve outcomes across a range of clinical presentations.

Comment

Better classification of subtypes of CRPS may aid choice of management strategies and clinical outcomes.

General Considerations

To help avoid unrealistic expectations, patients should be told that while there is no treatment proven to cure CRPS or reduce symptoms in all patients, the drugs that patients will receive during their treatment have been shown to help with CRPS for some patients.
Recognize that CRPS may be more than just a single unitary condition. Early CRPS (up to 6–18 months duration) can respond differently to interventions than persistent CRPS. Importantly, patients diagnosed with early CRPS likely will naturally improve and drugs or nerve-blocks that are effective even for only a few months may bridge the time to natural recovery. Approximately 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, and an early cold limb may be a poor prognostic sign.
Understand that most patients will over time develop analgesic tolerance to available drugs whereas side effects often continue.
Available drugs are not thought to "cure" the condition.
Monotherapy is best, to minimize adverse effects, cost, and patient non-compliance, but rational polypharmacy is often needed, particularly to address the various CRPS symptoms (and disease subtypes). This of course should comprise rational combinations of different classes of medications rather than multiple medications from the same class.
The choice of medications should include cost considerations and other patient needs.
Drugs that simultaneously treat multiple symptoms are desirable, for example, tricyclic antidepressants are relatively effective in RCTs for relieving neuralgic pain and also effective for anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
Traditionally, as needed (PRN) drug intake was considered inferior to scheduled drug intake. However, recognition that patients often develop tolerance to regular analgesic drug intake has changed this consideration somewhat. Some patients may benefit from taking certain drugs as and when required, for example after a bad day, or in anticipation of a difficult night. More research is needed to clarify this question.
Reasonable treatment outcomes should be agreed upon in partnership with the patient before treatment starts (e.g. a pain reduction of two points on a 0–10 scale, improvement in specific functional activities). If these targets are not achieved, or if initial beneficial effects later lessen, the drug treatment should then be reconsidered.

Prevention

Analysis and meta-analysis of the first four published studies on the use of vitamin C for prevention of CRPS suggested that vitamin C significantly reduced the likelihood of CRPS developing after limb fracture or surgery with 500 mg vitamin C daily recommended for at least 45 days after injury or surgery. However, a more recent large RCT that used this protocol for the prevention of post-fracture CRPS found that vitamin C was associated with an increased incidence of CRPS at 6 weeks after fracture relative to placebo, with no effect at subsequent time points The potential utility of vitamin C in the prevention of CRPS therefore remains unproven".

To summarize, there are few therapeutic drug trials in CRPS patients that meet criteria for level 1 or level 2 evidence. Clinicians must thus be guided by the results of RCTs for neuropathic pain, smaller specific CRPS trials, and clinical experience. A methodical and patient-centered empirical approach is essential (see Figure 3). New drugs should be trialed one at a time, up to maximum dose, and discontinued if not clearly helpful or where adverse effects are intolerable. The goal is as much to allow progress in functional restoration and rehabilitation as to relieve pain.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^114YMds6]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Current diagnostic criteria are very rigid and define patients with more severe or established CRPS, both in the clinic and for research purposes. Patients with lesser or earlier CRPS are not captured by these criteria yet early diagnosis and treatment seem the logical way to progress in order to achieve better outcomes. New criteria acknowledging CRPS as a spectrum diagnosis are needed.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^1165UvbX]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary of Rehabilitation

Rehabilitation plays a key role in the multidisciplinary management of CRPS, aiming to alleviate pain, restore limb function, and prevent chronic disability. Although studies remain limited, approaches such as MT, GMI, and PEPT show promising analgesic effects and are considered potential therapeutic options. Other physiotherapeutic interventions may also offer benefits; however, given the limited available evidence, their effectiveness should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, most rehabilitation studies for patients with CRPS have small sample sizes and are primarily focused on individuals with CRPS type I. Therefore, to establish more comprehensive evidence on rehabilitation strategies for CRPS, future studies should prioritize high-quality RCTs involving patients with different CRPS subtypes. Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on evaluating the long-term effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^112HuqMS]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Challenges exist in the terminology, definitions, and classification of CRPS. The progress made so far needs to be expanded through appreciation of the clinical features and pathophysiology of other similar and related chronic pain disorders. We suggest that better understanding and documentation of CRPS as a spectrum disorder rather than a dichotomous disorder will allow for earlier diagnosis and interventions with the likelihood of better prognosis.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113RtY42]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Even the identification and measurement of the pain, the principal symptom of CRPS, is problematic. The defining characteristic (and critical diagnostic criterion) is "continuing pain that is disproportionate to any inciting event" — pain deemed "disproportionate" in intensity and duration according to the (subjective) opinion of the diagnosing physician. The problem is that different types of physicians may have distinct impressions of what level of pain is disproportionate. This necessary, yet biased, assessment of pain is confounded by the patient's outlook; although pain is clearly a necessary and central component of a CRPS patient's condition, its report is always a personal, private, and entirely subjective experience. Any number of factors can affect pain report, including culture, memory of past pain experiences, the meaning and context of the pain, personality type, affective state, and many other functional variables. Furthermore, pain report is behavioral: filling out a visual analog scale is a behavior, and any such behavior can be affected by a range of psychosocial/operant features. Unfortunately, only the subjective experience of pain is quantifiable. Limited by this subjectivity of both physician and patient, the most pragmatic assessment of pain must be based upon the patient's complete context: biologic, psychologic, and sociologic. Obviously, the only treatment methodology that can treat all these aspects effectively is, again, the interdisciplinary approach.

### Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome [^1149oNZ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in The Cochrane Library, 2005, Issue 4, on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain used to treat complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure.

Search Methods

We updated searches of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library (Issue 11 of 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to 22/11/12), EMBASE (1974 to 22/11/12), LILACS (1982 to 22/11/12), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain (1995 to 2010), and various clinical trial registers (inception to 2012). We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity levels, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm.

Main Results

We included an additional 10 studies (combined n = 363) in this update. Overall we include 12 studies (combined n = 386). All included studies were assessed to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham. We were able to pool the results from two of these trials (intervention n = 23). Pooling did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for LASB (in terms of the risk of a 50% reduction of pain scores). Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB. Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to another active intervention. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block and other active treatments. Only five studies reported adverse effects, all with minor effects reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This update has found similar results to the original systematic review. There remains a scarcity of published evidence to support the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS. From the existing evidence it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^112fEtqd]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic and debilitating pain condition that typically develops following trauma, operation, or limb immobilization, with a reported prevalence of 5.46 to 26.2 per 100,000 individuals annually.CRPS occurs more commonly in females than in males, with reported female-to-male ratios ranging from 2:1 to 4:1. Patients with CRPS often experience substantial socioeconomic challenges. Approximately 30%–40% of affected patients with CRPS are unable to return to their jobs, and 27%–35% require workplace adaptations. At diagnosis, total healthcare and pain medication prescription costs are 2.17 and 2.56 times higher than baseline, respectively, peaking within the first year and gradually decreasing over time. Overall, their healthcare costs are approximately 20% higher than those of non-CRPS patients. Consequently, CRPS is associated with significantly reduced quality of life and represents a notable societal burden.

It is characterized by disproportionate pain not confined to a single peripheral nerve distribution, accompanied by varying combinations of sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, trophic, and motor abnormalities. CRPS has previously been referred to by several names, including reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causalgia, Sudeck's atrophy, algoneurodystrophy, and shoulder-hand syndrome. In 1994, a consensus conference in Orlando standardized the terminology as CRPS. The diagnosis of CRPS lacks specific confirmatory tests and is primarily clinical, based on patient history and symptomatology. In 2003, the Budapest criteria were introduced by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)to improve diagnostic consistency and were revised in 2012. In 2019, the IASP CRPS Special Interest Group convened a workshop in Valencia and proposed pragmatic updates to diagnostic instructions and taxonomy (Table 1). These revisions refined the definitions of CRPS type II (CRPS II) and CRPS Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), added a third CRPS subtype — CRPS with Remission of Some Features, and clarified symptom assessment procedures, while retaining the original phrasing to preserve criterion validity.

Clinical Recommendations

There is little well-controlled CRPS-specific outcome research on which to base psychological treatment recommendations for the condition. However, clinical experience and available data do suggest several specific strategies that may be helpful.

While there are indications that many cases of acute CRPS may resolve relatively quickly without any need for specific psychological intervention, a low cost and potentially helpful intervention recommended for all acute or chronic CRPS patients is comprehensive education about the condition. Specifically, it is recommended that all patients and their families receive detailed information early in treatment that addresses the negative effects of disuse, the importance of reactivation, the need for an active self-management approach to treatment, and that provides an explanation of how possible psychophysiological interactions could affect severity of CRPS. Such education may help prevent development of dysfunctional behavior patterns (e.g. elevated distress and severe disuse) that could contribute to the severity, disability, and chronicity of the condition. For more chronic CRPS patients or those who do not respond to limited intervention, individualized psychological evaluation is recommended, followed by focused psychological pain management treatment. An overview of several key issues to address in this assessment and treatment is provided below.

Psychological Assessment

Several specific areas of relevance to CRPS management should be addressed in the psychological evaluation, including: 1) presence of comorbid Axis I (or Axis II) psychiatric disorders, 2) cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses to CRPS, 3) ongoing life stressors, and 4) responses by significant others to the patient's CRPS. As noted previously, Axis I psychiatric disorders such as Major Depression, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder are at least as common in CRPS patients as in other chronic pain patients. The importance of assessing for disorders such as major depression is highlighted by the fact that diminished energy level and motivation related to clinical depression may be a significant barrier to success in active physically-focused treatment modalities (e.g. physical and occupational therapy); also, there are very effective and safe medications available. Identification of specific life stressors and general emotional arousal (depressed, anxious, fearful, or angry mood) even in the absence of clinically diagnosable psychiatric disorder may be equally important given possible psychophysiological interactions hypothesized above.

### Canadian surveillance study of complex regional pain syndrome in children [^114DHJAs]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This study describes the minimum incidence of pediatric complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), clinical features, and treatments recommended by pediatricians and pain clinics in Canada. Participants in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program reported new cases of CRPS aged 2 to 18 years monthly and completed a detailed case reporting questionnaire from September 2017 to August 2019. Descriptive analysis was completed, and the annual incidence of CRPS by sex and age groupings was estimated. A total of 198 cases were reported to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program, and 168 (84.8%) met the case definition. The minimum Canadian incidence of CRPS is estimated at 1.14/100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.93–1.35/100,000) children per year. Incidence was highest among girls 12 years and older (3.10, 95% confidence interval 2.76–3.44/100,000). The mean age of CRPS diagnosis was 12.2 years (SD = 2.4), with the mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis of 5.6 months (SD = 9.9) and no known inciting event for 19.6% of cases. Most cases had lower limb involvement (79.8%). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (82.7%) and acetaminophen (66.0%) were prescribed more commonly than antiepileptic drugs (52.3%) and antidepressants (32.0%). Referrals most commonly included physical therapy (83.3%) and multidisciplinary pain clinics (72.6%); a small number of patients withdrew from treatment because of pain exacerbation (5.3%). Pain education was recommended for only 65.6% of cases. Treatment variability highlights the need for empiric data to support treatment of pediatric CRPS and development of treatment consensus guidelines.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^115GUudA]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

4.1. Recommendations for clinicians in the adult setting

There is no gold standard laboratory, radiological, or genetic test to diagnose CRPS. This is true for many primary pain disorders, where the etiology is ill defined and can be highly variable with many contributing biological, psychological, and social factors. In addition, CRPS is highly complex with the large number of symptoms that coexist with pain. As is the case with many pain disorders, in the absence of a gold standard test, patients are often diagnosed based on a clinical diagnosis. To aid in making a clinical diagnosis for CRPS, clinicians can use one of the 4 diagnostic tools. There are no existing screening tools for CRPS, and as such, people with suspected CRPS should undergo rapid diagnostic assessment. Reducing wait-times for patients with suspected CRPS is recommended in community-based settings and specialist pain clinics.

Of the 4 diagnostic tools reviewed in this article, there are no significant differences in the feasibility of applying the criteria. All tools require a combination of physical examination and self-report, and none require costly equipment. The Budapest Criteria are explicitly endorsed by the IASP, the international society that makes recommendations on assessment, prevention, and treatment of pain diseases. Clinicians should follow the recommendations of the IASP and use the Budapest Criteria for diagnosing CRPS in adults. This review cannot make recommendations based on the sufficiency of measurement properties of the diagnostic tools because this review did not comprehensively examine them (eg, with a tool such as the COSMIN guideline for systematic reviews of outcome measures). However, based on the data that were gathered, no tool was comprehensively evaluated across all measurement property domains, which would be required to approach a strong recommendation according to COSMIN guidelines. Furthermore, there is a notably high degree of variability across studies in the sensitivity of the Budapest Criteria (45%-99%) and the Budapest Research Criteria (20%-78%). This highlights the importance of using clinical expertise, and not using any diagnostic tool as a standalone assessment.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^1127T41i]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Some interventions can be beneficial for multiple pain types in CRPS such as patient education, psychological interventions, and physical therapy. These therapies should be considered as part of a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program. Patient education should highlight a biopsychosocial model that addresses physical exercise, fatigue, stress reduction, and cognitive difficulties. Regarding psychological interventions for CRPS, there are only few small studies testing their efficacy for CRPS. Given the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic pain in general, its utility for the management of CRPS might also be expected. Furthermore, clinical experience indicates that mobilization and active physiotherapy play an important role in functional restoration, but the evidence about the effect of physical therapy on CRPS is still very uncertain. Our research groups recommend that the management of CRPS should be based on biopsychosocial model and psychological support and physical therapy should be integrated as early as possible and continued during the course of the syndrome (Table 2). Additional pharmacological treatment should target the most prominent pain type at clinical presentation and target specific underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS. When patients do not respond to conservative and pharmacological treatment, neurostimulation can be considered. Neurostimulation may target multiple mechanisms including neuropathic pain, ischemic pain, and inflammation. We suggest that neurostimulation also affects nociplastic pain, as it is described that neurostimulation inhibits pain transmission and neuron hyperactivity in the dorsal horn and activates descending modulatory pathways that suggest supraspinal involvement. A consensus-based e-health tool can help physicians in selecting CRPS patients for neurostimulation.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: manifestations and the role of neurostimulation in its management [^114mftjV]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

The hallmark of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is excruciating pain (aching, burning, pricking, or shooting). Diagnosis should be established as soon as possible, as response to treatment is adversely affected by any delay. Treatment of CRPS is aimed at improving function, using an interdisciplinary, time-dependent, patient-dependent approach that encompasses rehabilitation, psychological therapy, and pain management. If no response to conventional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) is noted within 12–16 weeks, a more interventional technique such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be used. SCS has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of CRPS type I, resulting in a significant, long-term reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life. SCS is particularly effective at helping to restore function in affected extremities, especially if applied early in the course of the disease. SCS is also cost effective and improves health-related quality of life.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^116rRaZU]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) may develop after limb trauma and is characterized by pain, sensory-motor and autonomic symptoms. Most important for the understanding of the pathophysiology of CRPS are recent results of neurophysiological research. Major mechanism for CRPS symptoms, which might be present subsequently or in parallel during the course of CRPS, are trauma-related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetically maintained pain and cortical reorganisation in response to chronic pain (neuroplasticity). The recognition of these mechanisms in individual CRPS patients is the prerequisite for a mechanism-oriented treatment.

### Experiences of diagnosis and treatment for upper limb complex regional pain syndrome: a qualitative analysis [^111cbSDD]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) most frequently affects the upper limb, with high associated disability. Delays to diagnosis and appropriate treatment can adversely impact prognosis and quality of life, but little is known about the healthcare experiences of people with CRPS. This study aimed to explore lived experiences of diagnosis and treatment for people with upper limb CRPS.

Methods

Participants were recruited through online support groups and multiple public and private healthcare settings in the Greater Wellington Region, New Zealand. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who had experienced upper limb CRPS for more than three months and less than three years. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.

Results

Thirteen participants (11 female, 2 male) aged between 43 and 68years were interviewed. Duration of CRPS ranged from 7months to 2.5years. Five themes were identified. Participants initially engaged in healthcare out of a desire to return to being the person they were before having CRPS. Three interacting experiences epitomised the overall healthcare experience: (1) not knowing what is going on, (2) not being taken seriously, and (3) healthcare as adding another layer of load. Meanwhile, participants used multiple approaches in an attempt to not let CRPS stop them from continuing to live their lives.

Conclusions

Participants in this study felt that credible information, validation, and simplification from healthcare providers and systems would support their process of navigating towards a meaningful life and self-concept in the presence of CRPS.

Beyond Dichotomous Diagnosis: Assessment of CRPS Symptom Severity

Dichotomous diagnostic criteria (yes/no), while valuable both clinically and in research for consistent identification of CRPS as a syndrome, do not capture individual differences in the severity of CRPS. Tracking severity of CRPS symptoms (i.e. beyond pain intensity) is important for monitoring treatment-related changes in clinical care and is potentially valuable as a disease modification outcome in CRPS clinical trials. In 2010, the CRPS Severity Score (CSS) was developed to address this gap (level 2). The CSS deliberately uses the components of the 2012 IASP diagnostic criteria (and can be applied in any clinic, without special training or equipment; i.e. it is accessible) to create a continuous index of CRPS symptom severity. The final CSS version contains 16 elements (8 signs and 8 symptoms; e.g. allodynia/hyperalgesia, edema, skin temperature changes etc.) coded as present/absent based on the history and physical examination (possible score 0–16). In initial development work, CSS scores were associated significantly, as expected (i.e. higher scores were linked to worse patient status), with dichotomous diagnosis results, levels of pain intensity, distress, and functional impairments; and they discriminated well between CRPS and non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients. In a subsequent cross-validation sample (level 2), CSS scores were relatively stable, as expected, in established chronic CRPS patients, with scores changing significantly more over time in acute CRPS patients undergoing initial treatment. Moreover, extent of changes in CSS scores over time were significantly associated with contemporaneous changes in pain intensity, fatigue, and functional impairments. Thus, the CSS appears to be valid and sensitive to change, a prerequisite for clinical utility. Available data indicate that a change of 5 or more CSS scale points reflects a clinically-significant change.

Interdisciplinary Management

The following interdisciplinary rehabilitation section focuses on the history, description and evidence for CRPS rehabilitation-based treatment. A systematic review of the evidence was conducted utilizing PubMed and MEDLINE. Search terms included "CRPS", "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome", "causalgia", "reflex sympathetic dystrophy", "rehabilitation", "interdisciplinary management", "occupational therapy", "physical therapy", "recreational therapy", and "vocational therapy". No time limit was applied to this search. Studies were selected based on the highest quality evidence available and relevance to CRPS rehabilitation. Also, anecdotal and practical information are included to assist the CRPS treatment practitioner.

A Dahlem type (think-tank) conference was held in Malibu, California, in 1997 to generate consensus as to treatment guidelines for CRPS. All treatments were focused on functional restoration (primarily the "reanimation of the affected part"); the use of drugs, blocks, and psychotherapy was reserved for patients failing to progress in the functional algorithm. Figure 2 portrays the Malibu CRPS treatment algorithm, updated to reflect some newer intervention approaches now available. Interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary pain management techniques emphasizing functional restoration are thought to be the most effective therapy for chronic pain, perhaps by resetting altered central processing and/or normalizing the distal environment (level 1). The Malibu algorithm has been corroborated and empirically "validated" by frequent clinical use, although a proper controlled trial of such a clinical algorithm is not fiscally feasible.

Pharmacotherapy

For the past 150 years, multiple drug treatments for CRPS have been tried. One of the first drugs mentioned was laudanum (tincture of opium) by Weir-Mitchell (who coined the term causalgia) and his use of the" new invention", the hypodermic syringe, to perform cocaine nerve blocks. Unfortunately, most medications used clinically to manage CRPS have not yet been tested adequately in high quality, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). This absence of multiple trials to document efficacy of many pharmacotherapy agents is attributable to many factors, including previous lack of uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria (preventing generalization across studies), the low prevalence of this rare disease causing difficulties in recruitment, as well as lack of funding for trials using promising older agents without patent protection to provide financial incentives. Fortunately, with the Food and Drug Administration's designation of CRPS as a Rare Disease in the past decade, industry interest in conducting definitive trials for CRPS therapeutics has increased.

The resourceful clinician will extrapolate from RCTs, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews concerning treatments for related neuropathic conditions and ultimately utilize empirical drug trials in each patient, based on consideration of what mechanisms seem most germane. However, repeated trials of ultimately ineffective drugs can also lead to patient frustration and disengagement. CRPS differs from other neuropathic pain syndromes by having additional tissues and systems involved, including the microcirculation, bone, and inflammatory pathways. In fact, although qualities of CRPS pain are often neuropathic, by currently accepted standards the condition does not fulfill criteria for neuropathic pain. Reliable data now show variable involvement of central sensitization, motor abnormalities, and sympathetic efferent features at different times and in different individuals suffering from CRPS. It is very likely that there will never be a single medication that will effectively treat all patients with this multi-factorial disease.

Medications trialed specifically for CRPS include calcitonin and bisphosphonates, and several immune modulating drugs. Treatments better studied in neuropathic pain include tricyclic anti-depressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, carbamazepine, opioids, clonidine, nifedipine, α-adrenergic antagonists, lidocaine patches, and topical capsaicin. This section summarizes the outcomes from the few CRPS trials, as well as the pertinent trials for related neuropathic pains. As with most treatments, drug therapy works best when prescribed in conjunction with functional restoration and treatment of other comorbid conditions (please see above).

### Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome [^111CMc6s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013 issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Birme), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and various clinical trial registers up to September 2015. We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS compared to placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included an additional four studies (N = 154) in this update. For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. As a result, we excluded four studies from the previous review in this update. Overall we included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32). They did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for LASB for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence). One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space, reporting statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one-year follow-up but not at short term follow-up (very low quality evidence). Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence). Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence). One small study compared ultrasound-guided LASB with non-guided LASB and found no clinically important difference in pain outcomes (very low quality evidence). Six studies reported adverse events, all with minor effects reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This update's results are similar to the previous versions of this systematic review, and the main conclusions are unchanged. There remains a scarcity of published evidence and a lack of high quality evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS. From the existing evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention, but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.

### Complex regional pain type 1 [^113a7XNk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome is increasingly recognized in the pediatric population. Owing to the nature of presentation with pain, many of these children present to the emergency setting at different stages of the syndrome with or without numerous prior interactions with health professionals. Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) is a clinical syndrome characterized by amplified musculoskeletal limb pain that is out of proportion to the history and physical findings, or pain due to non-noxious stimuli (allodynia/hyperalgesia), and accompanied by one or more signs of autonomic dysfunction. Differential diagnosis may include significant trauma (eg, fractures), inflammatory conditions, malignancies, and systemic illness. The diagnosis is clinical. The treatment goals for CRPS1 are restoration of function and relief of pain. Education, physical, and occupational therapy with psychotherapy and defined goals of achievement with reward are the mainstay of treatment for this population. Most children with CRPS1 will have a favorable outcome.

### Patients' experiences of treatment-relevant processes in multimodal pain rehabilitation for severe complex regional pain syndrome-a qualitative study [^1123GFEc]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a longstanding condition with spontaneous and evoked pain, that usually occurs in an upper or lower extremity. Although it often resolves within the first year, it may for a minority progress to a chronic and occasionally severely disabling condition. The aim of this study was to explore patients' experiences and perceived effects of a specific treatment, designed for patients with severe and highly disabling CRPS, in order to identify possible treatment-relevant processes.

Methods

The method used was a qualitative design, using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions to capture participants' experiences and perceptions. Ten interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis.

Results

Despite the fact that participants had a severe conditions, including nerve damage and a long duration of illness, they reported having been helped to increase flexible persistence, reduce fear and avoidance, and improve connections. This helped participants to significant improvements in daily life functioning.

Conclusions

The participants described distinct possible treatment-relevant processes leading to a substantial improvement in everyday life. The results imply that there is hope for this group that has been severely disabled for many years. This may help guide future clinical treatment trials.

### Experiences of diagnosis and treatment for upper limb complex regional pain syndrome: a qualitative analysis [^116utfut]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a pain condition characterised by severe pain and sensory, motor, and autonomic changes. It occurs most frequently following limb injury, although the trauma can be mild, and sometimes without initiating event. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, early uncontrolled baseline pain, crush injuries, severe fractures, immobilisation, and female gender. CRPS is thought to involve an interplay between aberrant inflammatory mechanisms, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity. Due in part to this complexity, CRPS can be difficult to diagnose and treat. The diagnostic criteria widely recognised today (the Budapest/New International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP] criteria) was proposed in 2003 in an attempt to standardise diagnosis. However, there remain delays to recognition, and, in turn, commencement of appropriate treatment. Such delays can lead to poorer outcomes and medicolegal complications; thus, early recognition and intervention is critical to reducing long-term disability and psychosocial distress.CRPS is associated with high health costs and work incapacity, severe pain, significant disability, and high risk of suicide. It most frequently affects the upper limb, disability of which has profound consequences for activities of daily living and wellbeing. Thus, CRPS of the upper limb may be particularly debilitating. Studies exploring lived experiences of CRPS often feature challenges to receiving a diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Calls have been made for more lived experience research to enhance understanding and enable development of appropriate national pain strategies and treatment guidelines. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore lived experiences of diagnosis and treatment for people with upper limb CRPS in New Zealand.

Given the nearly complete absence of RCTs of psychological interventions for CRPS, results of a recent review and meta-analysis of cognitive behavioral interventions in other neuropathic pain patients may be informative. Only a single randomized controlled trial of high methodological quality was identified, which demonstrated significant efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions for reducing neuropathic pain intensity, although this effect was restricted to women (level 2). However, meta-analysis of all four available controlled trials (level 1) indicated no overall significant effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on neuropathic pain intensity. These results do not provide unambiguous support for the likely efficacy of psychological interventions in CRPS patients, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limited number of studies available.

In summary, there are only a few small RCTs specifically testing the efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS, either alone or in the multidisciplinary context. However, the data available do suggest that psychological interventions are likely to be a useful part of a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program. The efficacy of such techniques for CRPS would not be surprising, given the strong evidence of their utility in other types of chronic pain. These results will be briefly summarized below.

Another application of behavioral therapy for CRPS management noted previously is graded exposure therapy, an intervention that directly targets pain-related fears and learned disuse. In an initial trial of this intervention, in vivo graded exposure therapy was used to target fear of movement in eight CRPS patients in a series of well-controlled single subject experiments (level 3 evidence). This exposure therapy resulted in significant reductions in pain-related fear of movement, with pain, disability, and other symptoms of CRPS also decreasing significantly in parallel fashion. A subsequent RCT (level 2) showed that compared to treatment as usual (pain-contingent therapy), in vivo exposure led to significantly greater improvements in pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, perceived harmfulness of activities, and disability at 6 month follow-up. These results are consistent with findings based on per protocol (but not intent-to-treat) analyses in a separate RCT (level 2). Recent work suggest that exposure therapy may be more effective for CRPS when it targets a greater variety of feared activities.

### Parameters of spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114fwHAc]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic debilitating neuropathic pain condition characterized by autonomic and inflammatory features that typically occurs after a traumatic event. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic CRPS refractory to conventional treatment modalities. The collective evidence of novel parameters of SCS for treating CRPS has not been characterized extensively.

Objective

To provide evidence for the use of SCS to treat CRPS and characterize the additional benefits of various SCS waveforms.

Study Design

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Methods

PubMed, Embase and CINHLA were screened for all randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing SCS parameters for the treatment of CRPS.

Results

Four RCTs were identified that included SCS as a treatment arm for CRPS. Of these, one study compared low frequency tonic SCS (LF-SCS) versus conventional physical therapy, 2 studies compared placebo/sham SCS with LF-SCS and a multitude of waveforms, and one study compared LF-SCS with high-frequency SCS (HF-SCS). Two of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, one study was rated as having some concerns for bias, while the final study was rated as having a high risk of bias. A meta-analysis of 4 studies comparing conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation against LF-SCS revealed increased benefit of LF-SCS in pain reduction up to a month (mean difference [MD] = -1.17 points; 95% CI = -1.61 to -0.73; P < 0.001, I² = 42%). Another meta-analysis of 2 studies showed that LF-SCS results in higher global perceived effect scores relative to conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation (MD = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.15; P < 0.001, I2 = 0%).

Limitations

A pooled analysis using different designs for RCTs was conducted. Some studies folded in multiple neuropathic pain pathologies in addition to CRPS. One study was at a high risk for bias in at least one domain.

Conclusion

LF-SCS is superior to conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation. However, more evidence is required to demonstrate that novel SCS parameters are superior to LF-SCS in improving pain scores and functional outcomes.

### Expose or protect? A randomized controlled trial of exposure in vivo vs pain-contingent treatment as usual in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type 1 [^1172gBQ6]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) highly affects patients' ability to perform daily life activities. Pain-related fear might be a key target to reduce disability in chronic pain. Current treatments aiming at reducing pain show little improvements on pain and disability, whereas novel exposure-based treatments targeting pain-related fears have shown to be promising. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (N = 46) comparing exposure in vivo (EXP) with pain-contingent treatment as usual (TAU), for CRPS-I patients with at least moderate levels of pain-related fear. Primary outcome is self-reported disability, for upper and lower extremity, respectively. Secondary outcomes are self-reported pain-intensity, pain-catastrophizing, perceived harmfulness of physical activity, and health-related quality of life. Pretreatment to posttreatment and pretreatment to 6-month follow-up change scores were tested using randomization-based inference. EXP was superior to TAU in reducing upper extremity disability from pretreatment to posttreatment (between-group difference, 1.082; 95% confidence interval, 0.563–1.601; P < 0.001) and from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up (1.303; 95% CI, 0.917–1.690; P < 0.001). EXP was superior in reducing lower extremity disability from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up (3.624; 95% CI, 0.467–6.781; P = 0.02), but not from pretreatment to posttreatment (3.055; 95% CI, -0.018 to 6.128; P = 0.054). All secondary outcomes significantly favored EXP pretreatment to posttreatment, as well as pretreatment to 6-month follow-up. Exposure to daily activities shows to be more effective than a protective pain-contingent TAU in reducing self-reported disability in daily life of CRPS-I patients with at least moderate levels of pain-related fear.

### The valencia consensus-based adaptation of the IASP complex regional pain syndrome diagnostic criteria [^115oyAyQ]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

It is hoped that the modified ICD-11 text clarifies important pragmatic aspects of CRPS assessment and diagnosis, and that it will enhance usability of these criteria in both clinical and research settings. All changes and clarifications marked with a # above have already been incorporated into the ICD-11 CRPS text and should be applied in the CRPS diagnostic process immediately. Future research should (1) clarify whether CRPS type 1 and 2 are indeed separate entities or are better merged; (2) assess whether introduction of further subgroups such as warm-cold and early-persistent CRPS is useful (eg, for predicting treatment responses); (3) ascertain the utility of biomarkers for supporting the clinical CRPS diagnosis; and (4) define "resolved CRPS".

Evidence in non-CRPS pain conditions also suggests that targeting acceptance of CRPS may enhance pain coping and quality of life in CRPS patients. ACT is considered a next generation CBT intervention, and it focuses on helping patients engage in flexible patterns of behavior that increase engagement in valued life activities despite continuing pain and discomfort. Given the dearth of proven medical interventions for CRPS and its sometimes intractable nature, interventions such as ACT that target learning to live more effectively with the condition are likely to prove valuable.

Given the impact of learned disuse as a potential barrier to reactivation, behavioral interventions targeting this disuse can also be an integral component of the overall treatment program. Reactivation and behavioral goals must necessarily balance disuse concerns with avoiding severe pain exacerbations that could potentially contribute to maintenance of CRPS and reinforce learned disuse. Realistic pain-limited incremental reactivation is key, with the psychologist and functional therapists coordinating efforts to ensure that appropriate activity goals are set and that problems encountered in this reactivation process (e.g. pain-related fear of movement) are effectively addressed. As noted above, there is some experimental evidence supporting the efficacy of graded in vivo exposure therapy to address pain-related fear in CRPS, with apparent beneficial effects on pain and other CRPS symptoms as well.

### The efficacy of an interdisciplinary pain management program for complex regional pain syndrome compared to low back pain and chronic widespread pain: an observational study [^115vhUP2]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating condition which can occur in a person's limb following injury or surgery, or spontaneously. It is characterised by significant pain, sensory changes, temperature disturbance, discolouration, swelling, abnormal sweating, and trophic changes to nails, hair and skin. The pathophysiology of CRPS is complex and includes inflammatory mechanisms, autonomic dysregulation and nociplastic changes to the central nervous system. Full recovery from CRPS is relatively rare and it frequently leads to long-term disability.CRPS often causes significant psychological distress, and people with CRPS generally require support to manage pain, functional limitations and the broader effects of the condition.

Because CRPS is relatively uncommon, large clinical trials are challenging to conduct and there is a paucity of research documenting treatment efficacy. Although there have been some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medical and physiotherapy interventions for CRPS, these are relatively few and treatment guidelines focus on functional restoration and physical rehabilitation, in addition to education, psychological intervention and pain relief.

Interdisciplinary pain management programs (IPMPs) are typically 3–4 week fulltime programs (30–40 hours per week) provided to people with chronic pain. They deliver cognitive and behavioural interventions including pain education, goal setting and activity planning, graded exercise, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, and medication management, in an environment designed to reinforce "well" behavior (ie, operant therapy). The efficacy of IPMPs is well established for mixed chronic pain samples, low back pain (LBP), neck pain and chronic widespread pain (CWP). Treatment guidelines for CRPS include a recommendation for interdisciplinary pain management, and 80% of clinicians report using IPMPs for patients with persistent CRPS 9; however, there are no published RCTs evaluating the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapies or IPMPs in this population. Several observational studies have reported improvements in physical function, disability and emotional distress following an IPMP for a CRPS population, with mixed findings on outcomes for pain intensity. However, no studies of IPMP outcomes for CRPS have included a comparison group to test whether people with CRPS have a comparable treatment response as those with more widely studied conditions, where there is evidence for IPMP efficacy (LBP, CWP).

Table 2
IASP diagnostic criteria for CRPS

Table 3
Budapest clinical diagnostic criteria for CRPS

As previously mentioned, the diagnosis of CRPS is a clinical one, based on a meticulous history and physical examination which includes a thorough neurologic assessment. The diagnostic criteria developed for the diagnosis of adult CRPS can further assist in the diagnosis of CRPS in children and adolescents. We recommend that all patients suspected of CRPS should also undergo baseline laboratory tests, including complete blood count, blood chemistry, CRP, ESR, creatinine kinase and ANA. When the history or physical examination arouses suspicion of an active thyroid disease, thyroid function test should be performed as well. It is also recommended to perform a plain radiograph (if not previously performed) of the affected limb to rule out any localized pathology to the bones, joints and surrounding tissue. Usually, no further diagnostic evaluations are needed if there are no abnormal findings in the initial diagnostic workup. However, if the initial diagnostic workup suggests a different diagnosis, such as infection, a rheumatic disease, or a malignancy, further laboratory and imaging test are needed.

Treatment

The primary goals for the treatment of CRPS are pain relief and the improvement of all domains of functioning; thus, improving the patient's quality of life. The scope of therapy includes an intensive physical therapy program combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention. This often contradicts the patient's logic, where rest is considered as means of improving his or her symptoms. A Cochrane review published in 2013 on interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with CRPS concluded that there was a lack of high quality evidence for most CRPS therapies. In 2012, The American Pain Society published a position statement on assessing and managing children with chronic pain. It recommended the use of interdisciplinary treatment programs for children with chronic pain, which incorporate CBT with physical and occupational rehabilitation.

### Physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral treatment for complex regional pain syndromes [^114cWeYC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS; type 1, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and type 2, causalgia) involve persistent pain, allodynia, and vasomotor signs. We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-blind trial of physical therapy (PT) and cognitive-behavioral treatment for children and adolescents with CRPS. Children 8 to 17 years of age (n = 28) were randomly assigned to either group A (PT once per week for 6 weeks) or group B (PT 3 times per week for 6 weeks). Both groups received 6 sessions of cognitive-behavioral treatment. Assessments of pain and function were repeated at two follow-up time periods. Outcomes were compared at the three time points through the use of parametric or nonparametric analysis of variance and post hoc tests. All five measures of pain and function improved significantly in both groups after treatment, with sustained benefit evident in the majority of patients at long-term follow-up. Recurrent episodes were reported in 50% of patients, and 10 patients eventually received sympathetic blockade. Most children with CRPS showed reduced pain and improved function with a noninvasive rehabilitative treatment approach. Long-term functional outcomes were also very good.

An iterative program of research, conducted by members of the COMPACT consortium, has informed the development of the long-term, international CRPS clinical research registry and core data set (Figure 1). This work is ongoing, and more detail is given below on each stage of the program to date.

Figure 1.
COMPACT process.

A CRPS Core Data Set

A core outcome measurement set can be defined as a minimum set of standardized outcomes, which should be measured and reported in all research studies for a particular clinical condition. The COMPACT core data set was developed in two stages and includes:

Demographic data
Patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures
Clinician-reported outcomes/questionnaires.
Clinical outcome measures (currently in development)

In the first stage, a core set of patient-reported and clinician-reported questionnaire outcome measures was agreed upon (Table 4). This work was informed by a systematic literature review utilizing PubMed of outcome measures used in CRPS clinical trials (level 1 evidence), and an online survey (level 4 evidence) of usage of outcome measures in CRPS clinical trials by healthcare professionals and academics. Agreement on the final core set was achieved by means of consensus within international workshops. The patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures captured the minimum domains needed to answer the consortium-agreed research question "What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS and what factors influence it?" and comprised the following domains: pain, disease severity, participation and function, emotional and psychological function, sleep quality, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and patient's global impression of change. One clinician-reported questionnaire outcome measure, namely, the CSS, was also included.

Table 4.
COMPACT data set

The second stage was comprised of a two stage e-Delphi study of clinicians and academics working internationally in the area of CRPS in order to agree on which (if any) clinical outcome measures should be included in the core data set. Results of the e-Delphi survey were presented to core members of the study team in a workshop held in Valencia, Spain, in September 2019. The group considered the feasibility and acceptability of each outcome in the final selected list, and whether an outcome should be "core" or optional. This work is in preparation for publication.

Motor Cortex Stimulation

Of all therapies, ranging from minimally invasive to interventional, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is the most invasive form of treatment for pain conditions, including CRPS. The mechanism of action for MCS is the modulation of pathologic hyperactivity in the thalamic relay nuclei. Deafferentation results in the loss of inhibitory control of the nociceptive neurons, and MCS has been shown to normalize this disinhibition to a greater degree than somatosensory cortex stimulation (level 4). Similar to SCS procedures, a trial is required prior to the implantation of MCS. Risks are surprisingly rare but complications may occur consistent with other chronically implanted hardware in functional neurosurgery (level 4).

According to the spirit of the Malibu treatment scheme (Figure 2) simpler, less invasive, less dangerous and less expensive interventional techniques should be tried before invasive, experimental and much more expensive techniques (Figure 4 and Appendix A2).

Inadequate or partial response to any mentioned therapy may lead to a stepwise progression down through modalities always in conjunction with other non-interventional treatments.

In this 5th edition of these diagnostic and treatment guidelines, we find progress evident in diagnosis, clinical outcome measures, and evidence-based treatments compared to prior versions. Nonetheless, the conclusion in prior guidelines that "we need more high quality research regarding CRPS interventions" still stands. There are few interventions with efficacy that has been convincingly demonstrated, and until such data are available, reliance on the standard clinical principles of interdisciplinary pain and symptom management will be necessary. While evidence for efficacy of most CRPS interventions remains weak in CRPS patients as a group, we suggest that going forward there may be value in exploring intervention efficacy within empirically-identified CRPS subtypes (e.g. warm vs cold CRPS) to determine whether a precision medicine approach to CRPS management could enhance outcomes. In each clinical situation the specific risk, benefit and expense of any intervention must be carefully and continuously considered.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^116Yk6v1]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

This systematic review identified 4 diagnostic tools validated for use in adults, none validated in pediatric populations, and no screening tools for any age group. The 4 diagnostic tools identified include the Veldman criteria, IASP criteria, Budapest Criteria, and Budapest Research Criteria. Several studies suggest that early diagnosis intervention may lead to a more favorable outcome and potentially prevent disability and poor quality of life. The importance of early diagnosis is recognized by the IASP that recommends rapid assessment of acute CRPS. Furthermore, an accurate diagnosis is critical, given that CRPS has specific treatments that differ from other types of chronic pain; for example, common interventions for CRPS include specific physiotherapies (graded motor imagery), pharmacotherapy (intravenous ketamine), and interventions (spinal cord stimulation).

The results of this review represent how our understanding of this rare disease has evolved. In 1993, expert consensus agreed upon the term CRPS, and defined 2 subtypes (1 and 2). In the same year, 2 sets of diagnostic criteria (the IASP criteria and Veldman criteria) were published. Another critical time point was the expert consensus meeting held by the IASP in Budapest in 2003 whereby the former IASP criteria were replaced with the Budapest Criteria. These new criteria were more robust, including more diverse symptoms, particularly with the addition of motor and trophic features.

### Global burden of complex regional pain syndrome in at-risk populations: estimates of prevalence from 35 countries between 1993 and 2023 [^112SNXuP]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, the most commonly used diagnostic criteria are the Budapest criteria, followed by The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria, and Veldman criteria. However, due to the complex and variable presentation of CRPS, there is no gold standard test for diagnosis, and clinicians often rely on clinical assessment supported by imaging, such as x-ray evidence of trophic changes, 3-phase (Tc99m) bone scintigraphy, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Owing to its variable manifestation and unknown pathophysiology, CRPS treatment remains challenging. Patients typically require an interdisciplinary and multimodal approach, including conservative treatment (eg, physical therapy, mirror therapy, and acupuncture), multimodal pharmacological therapy, and interventional procedures (eg, sympathetic plexus block, spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and intrathecal drug delivery). Despite these efforts, severe cases may progress to the extent of requiring amputation. The multifaceted treatment contributes to the substantial economic burden associated with CRPS. Analysis of the Swiss national database revealed that management of CRPS approximates $86,900 in insurance costs and $23,300 in treatment costs per affected individual over a 5-year period. Moreover, after diagnosis, health care costs double, and prescription costs increase by approximately 2.6-fold from baseline costs annually.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that is debilitating and dramatically decreases quality of life. CRPS is characterized by a constellation of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction.CRPS differs from other chronic pain conditions; neuropathic or generalized non-specific pain conditions; in that pain is associated with obvious and distinct alterations in sensory processing, sympathetic nervous involvement, and motor dysfunction. CRPS patients commonly present with allodynia whereby non-painful stimuli evoke a painful sensation. The worldwide incidence of CRPS is 26.2 per 100,000 people per yearand is 3 to 4 times more prevalent in females. Options for medical management of CRPS include medications such as opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and procedures such as sympathetic blockade and invasive spinal cord stimulation. However, evidence for these treatments come from medium to low quality randomized controlled trials (RCT). At present, CRPS is managed through continued physiotherapy with supportive treatment for pain and mental health.

### Bisphosphonates in complex regional pain syndrome type I: how do they work? [^114AeX7B]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Complex Regional Pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) is a disease characterised by extreme pain for which no gold-standard treatment exists to date. In recent years a possible role for bisphosphonates in the treatment of CRPS-I has been proposed. These drugs were first used for their effect in decreasing pain in bone diseases in which bisphosphonates act through their antiosteoclastic properties (metastatic disease, Paget disease, myeloma). In CRPS-I, enhanced osteoclastic activity has never clearly been demonstrated and the benefit shown is possibly exerted by different mechanisms of action. In this paper we review other conjectural mechanisms involved in reducing pain intensity and improving clinical signs and functional status in these patients. The results of most studies on this topic show that bisphosphonates may be effective in the early phases of the disease, when scintigraphic bone scan more frequently shows a local radiotracer accumulation that possibly means a high local concentration of the drug. These features probably represent the required conditions by which bisphosphonates might modulate various inflammatory mediators that are upregulated in CRPS-I. Patients in whom a scintiscan is often negative (long-standing disease or a primarily cold disease) could be less responsive to this treatment. With these limitations, bisphosphonates appear to present a therapeutic strategy that has been proven to reliably offer benefits in patients with CRPS-I.

Interdisciplinary versus Multidisciplinary

Although interdisciplinary treatment programs are clearly the sine qua non of CRPS treatment (holistic, planned team treatment with special training of all modalities; meeting frequently to assess plan, progress/problems and re-plan as a team), this level of intensity is often unavailable except in large urban or academic centers. Payors often consider these interdisciplinary programs to be "too expensive" (although in actuality, our urban 4 week program costs 1/3 to 1/2 as much as a single spinal cord stimulator implant, and this doesn't consider maintenance, re-implant with lead failure etc.) and opt for less effective, but better understood single modalities. Whatever the rationale for interdisciplinary unavailability, the next best option is a multidisciplinary approach. This approach is traditionally characterized by a single lead practitioner (usually a physician or psychologist) organizing and arranging for specialty training and coordination of local resources, and then referring the patient to these separate modalities. Unfortunately, this is labor intensive (and poorly reimbursed) for the knowledgeable lead practitioner, as the only coordination is via the reports of the isolated modalities (e.g. no real "team"). However, in the context of a multifactorial disease such as CRPS, and the uncertainty as to which modalities are "going to work", either of these options is far superior to an unidisciplinary/unimodal approach.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type I with neridronate: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113i5n6s]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) is a severely disabling pain syndrome for which no definite treatment has been established. The aim of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was to test the efficacy of the amino-bisphosphonate neridronate in patients with CRP-I.

Methods

Eighty-two patients with CRP-I at either hand or foot were randomly assigned to i.v. infusion of 100 mg neridronate given four times over 10 days or placebo. After 50 days the former placebo patients were given open label the same regimen of neridronate.

Results

Within the first 20 days, visual analogue scale (VAS) score decreased significantly more in the neridronate group. In the following 20 days, VAS remained unchanged in the placebo group and further decreased in the active group by 46.5 mm (95% CI -52.5, -40.5) vs 22.6 mm (95% CI -28.8, -16.3) for placebo group (P < 0.0001). Significant improvements vs placebo were observed also for a number of other indices of pain and quality of life. During the open-extension phase in the formerly placebo group the results of treatment were superimposable on those seen during the blind phase in the active group. A year later none of the patients was referring symptoms linked to CRPS-I.

Conclusion

In patients with acute CRPS-I, four i.v. infusions of neridronate 100 mg are associated with clinically relevant and persistent benefits. These results provide conclusive evidence that the use of bisphosphonates, at appropriate doses, is the treatment of choice for CRPS-I.

In conclusion, these findings argue against the historical three sequential stages of CRPS. Nonetheless, lack of support for traditional sequential stages does not invalidate the concept of other CRPS subtypes that may evolve over time. One promising candidate, consistent with clinical observations, is the distinction between "warm CRPS" and "cold CRPS". A large, international, prospective multi-site study tested whether distinct warm and cold CRPS subtypes could be identified solely using unbiased statistical pattern recognition (i.e. no a priori assumptions). Results of cluster analysis using automated cluster selection revealed a warm CRPS patient cluster characterized by a warm, red, dry and edematous extremity, and a distinct cold CRPS patient cluster characterized by a cold, blue, sweaty and less edematous extremity (level 2). Consistent with clinical observations, median CRPS duration was much shorter in the warm CRPS subtype (4.7 months) than in the cold CRPS subtype (20 months), with comparable pain intensity across these subtypes. Although a warm presentation is by far the most common in early CRPS, a small subgroup of patients was noted who had CRPS of brief duration yet displayed a cold CRPS pattern, a group provisionally-labelled "primary cold CRPS". Further bearing on the issue of temporal sequencing of these subtypes, a score reflecting total number of inflammatory features was found to be significantly elevated at baseline in the warm subtype relative to the cold subtype, with these elevations significantly diminishing only in the warm CRPS subtype over a 3-month follow-up period. This pattern is what might be expected if cold CRPS reflected a relatively stable chronic non-inflammatory condition, whereas warm CRPS were more of an acute inflammatory state subject to a later transition in phenotype. Future application of comparable analytic methods to the complexities of CRPS may permit the identification of other discrete CRPS subgroups which may eventually permit more effective targeting of treatment interventions. Although potentially important clinically, classification of "warm CRPS" vs "cold CRPS" in diagnosis remains at present an informal subtyping. There remains some hesitancy among experts to making this distinction a "formal" CRPS subtype until additional research is conducted, although there is agreement that clinicians should note whether a patient's CRPS presentation is predominately warm or cold, given its possible implications for prognosis and treatment. It is important to note that at this time there is no evidence to suggest that "subtyping" in any way obviates the need for interdisciplinary care, and subtyping (presumably reflecting different mechanisms) may be most relevant to predicting responses to individual interventions.

Efficacy of Psychological Interventions in CRPS Patients

A PubMed literature review reveals a number of studies that have addressed efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS, although nearly all of these reflect uncontrolled designs that permit only limited conclusions to be drawn. An additional caveat regarding these studies is that the criteria used to diagnose CRPS were often not adequately described and in all likelihood varied substantially across studies. This lack of consistent or specified diagnostic criteria limits the ability to generalize these results to patients diagnosed according to current IASP criteria for CRPS.

A summary of studies specifically reporting on efficacy of psychological treatments for CRPS is presented in Appendix A1. This reveals few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically testing psychological interventions in CRPS patients. Fialka et al. (level 2) randomized 18 CRPS patients to receive either home PT or home PT plus once-weekly autogenic relaxation training for ten weeks. Both groups showed similar improvements in pain, range of motion, and edema, although patients in the PT+Autogenics group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in limb temperature. Although low statistical power due to the small sample limited the ability to adequately evaluate intervention efficacy, these results suggest that relaxation-based interventions may have some benefit in management of CRPS.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type I with bisphosphonates [^115voNes]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I), also named as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, is a common and disabling disorder affecting a peripheral limb. CRPS-I usually develops after a noxious event, such as a trauma or surgery to an extremity, without any nerve injury/damage. CRPS-I is classically distinguished from CRPS-II that occurs after injury/damage to a peripheral nerve.

At present, several pharmacological treatments (eg, analgesics, anaesthetics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, oral muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, calcitonin, bisphosphonates and calcium channel blockers) have been proposed to reduce pain and pain sensitisation, and to improve functional status in patients presenting with CRPS-I. While most of these medications demonstrated poor or partial efficacy on the short term, bisphosphonates (BPs) showed better long-term beneficial effects on pain reduction and functional recovery.

This narrative review summarises recent insights about the treatment of CRPS-I with BPs from the last Osteo-Rheumatology Meeting, which took place in Genoa (Italy) on October 2014. The main objectives of this overview are to summarise briefly current knowledge about the pathophysiology of CRPS-I, to highlight the potential mechanisms of action of BPs in CRPS-I and finally, to summarise main results of randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of BPs in CRPS-I.

### Prism adaptation treatment for upper-limb complex regional pain syndrome: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116e3tis]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Initial evidence suggested that people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have reduced attention to the affected side of their body and the surrounding space, which might be related to pain and other clinical symptoms. Three previous unblinded, uncontrolled studies showed pain relief after treatment with prism adaptation, an intervention that has been used to counter lateralised attention bias in brain-lesioned patients. To provide a robust test of its effectiveness for CRPS, we conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial of prism adaptation for unilateral upper-limb CRPS-I. Forty-nine eligible adults with CRPS were randomized to undergo 2 weeks of twice-daily home-based prism adaptation treatment (n = 23) or sham treatment (n = 26). Outcomes were assessed in person 4 weeks before and immediately before treatment, and immediately after and 4 weeks after treatment. Long-term postal follow-ups were conducted 3 and 6 months after treatment. We examined the effects of prism adaptation vs sham treatment on current pain intensity and the CRPS symptom severity score (primary outcomes), as well as sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, self-reported psychological functioning, and experimentally tested neuropsychological functions (secondary outcomes). We found no evidence that primary or secondary outcomes differed between the prism adaptation and sham treatment groups when tested at either time point after treatment. Overall, CRPS severity significantly decreased over time for both groups, but we found no benefits of prism adaptation beyond sham treatment. Our findings do not support the efficacy of prism adaptation treatment for relieving upper-limb CRPS-I. This trial was prospectively registered (ISRCTN46828292).

Summary of Pharmacological Treatment

Currently, no universally accepted pharmacological treatment is considered optimal for CRPS. However, current evidence allows a tentative ranking of available pharmacological treatments according to their efficacy and the quality of supporting research findings.

Bisphosphonates and ketamine demonstrate the most consistent analgesic efficacy in meta-analyses, reporting no serious adverse events, therefore making them preferred treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice and are generally regarded as safe; however, their analgesic effectiveness remains controversial across studies.

Neuropathic pain medications — including anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin), TCAs, and SNRIs — are commonly prescribed for CRPS, but evidence supporting their use in CRPS is limited and is primarily extrapolated from studies on broader neuropathic pain conditions.

Opioids are occasionally prescribed for CRPS, and the evidence supporting their effectiveness is sparse and insufficient to recommend routine use.

Meta-analyses show that NSAIDs, magnesium sulfate, and free radical scavengers (eg, DMSO and NAC) lack significant analgesic benefit and are therefore not recommended as core treatment options.

BTX-A, particularly when administered to the stellate ganglion or other sympathetic regions, demonstrates efficacy and safety in a limited number of studies. However, supporting evidence remains scarce. Calcitonin has yielded conflicting results across studies and is infrequently used in clinical practice. Similarly, alpha-adrenergic modulators are not routinely recommended owing to limited research and a higher risk of adverse effects.

Topical agents, including ketamine cream and lidocaine, remain under-investigated but may offer localized symptom relief.

Finally, emerging therapies, such as immunomodulatory approaches (eg, IVIG and PE) and cytokine or glial cell modulation (eg, TNF-α antagonists and LDN), show preliminary promise in small studies and case reports, but high-quality clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety.

Future pharmacological research in CRPS should prioritize high-quality RCTs to confirm the efficacy and safety of promising agents such as bisphosphonates and ketamine. Additionally, further studies are needed to better define the role of routinely used medications such as systemic corticosteroids and neuropathic pain medications (anticonvulsants, TCAs, and SNRIs). Emerging therapies — including immunomodulatory agents (eg, IVIG and PE) and cytokine or glial modulators (eg, TNF-α antagonists and LDN) — also warrant further investigation. Future trials should also be designed to account for different CRPS subtypes and disease stages, facilitating the identification of patient groups most likely to benefit from targeted treatment approaches. Additionally, greater attention should be given to evaluating the long-term efficacy of pharmacological treatments.

Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Given their anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, and free-radical scavengers are potentially useful for addressing pain that may be related to the inflammatory component of CRPS. However, CRPS inflammation may be largely neurogenic (initiated by inflammatory mediators from the terminals of afferent nociceptors), and no drugs have proven effective for this type of inflammation. Many patients may have spontaneous improvement in inflammatory features over time — even those patients whose pain does not get better.

This class of drugs would appear to be potentially useful for both prophylaxis and rescue, although this has not been directly evaluated in clinical trials. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase and prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and hyperalgesia and thus may inhibit nociceptive processing. Our clinical experience finds NSAIDs effective for some CRPS patients (level 4 evidence). In addition to treating CRPS, NSAIDs have also been used to treat other neuropathic pain conditions, particularly when associated with inflammation (level 3 evidence). CRPS usually affects distal extremities, while more proximal muscle groups, such as in the shoulder, frequently hurt (in response to persistent guarding of the limb) without directly being affected by CRPS. This type of myofascial pain/muscle pain may respond to NSAIDs.

Research support for NSAID utility in CRPS is lacking, with one study showing no analgesic value in treating CRPS. Specific NSAIDs may be more useful than others. Ketoprofen, for example, may have substantial anti-bradykinin and anti-prostacyclin effects in addition to the typical anti-prostaglandin effect. Inhibitors selective for cyclooxygenase-2 (e.g. celecoxib) have not been tested in CRPS, although are reported anecdotally to be of some use (level 4 evidence). Highly publicized concerns of cardiac risk somewhat limit the widespread use of COX-2 inhibitors. We note that acetaminophen is currently not recommended for treatment of chronic disease due to the potential for liver toxicity with regular or high dose use.

### Experiences of diagnosis and treatment for upper limb complex regional pain syndrome: a qualitative analysis [^116AYcgR]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Upper limb CRPS significantly changes people's lives and self-concept, leading people to engage with healthcare while embarking on their own navigation process. In this study, participants described the challenges of trying to fit themselves into the existing healthcare system, and desired a combination of information, validation, and simplification to support them in moving forward with CRPS. This indicates a need for a paradigm shift in CRPS management, where healthcare providers consciously enter individuals' lives and fit treatment into this. These findings lead to the following recommendations: for provision of timely, holistic, and credible information about CRPS to individuals, greater emphasis on the therapeutic alliance between the individual and healthcare providers, and a unified team approach to simplify and improve healthcare for CRPS.

A recent IASP consensus meeting in Valencia, Spain, addressed another important CRPS diagnostic subtype issue. In both the 1994 and 2012 versions of the IASP criteria, there was no CRPS subtype category to capture patients who had previously been diagnosed with CRPS, then improved sufficiently to no longer meet the full criteria but suffered from continued symptoms requiring ongoing care. This significant clinical issue prompted the proposal of a new formal CRPS subtype termed "CRPS with Remission of Some Features". This subtype will be included in the new ICD-11 version of the CRPS criteria. It should be applied only to patients who were documented to meet full CRPS criteria at an earlier point in time but who currently do not display sufficient signs and symptoms to meet full criteria. Patients in this category are not necessarily improved with regards to pain intensity nor are they free of all CRPS-related signs and symptoms, and they may "relapse". We empirically note the occasional patient who may fully meet diagnostic criteria one day and not the next. It is critical for legal and insurance reasons that temporarily not meeting criteria, for whatever reason, is not considered equal to a "cure" of the condition, particularly given the known lability of CRPS features.

A final CRPS subtyping issue is the distinction between CRPS-Type I (without "major nerve damage") and CRPS-Type II (with "major nerve damage"; see Table 2). This is an historical distinction carried over into the 1994 IASP CRPS criteria based on the previously separate diagnostic categories of RSD (now CRPS-Type I) and Causalgia (now CRPS-Type II). At the time of the Budapest consensus group meeting, there was broad agreement that problems do exist with creating this division given the large overlap in clinical features between them (i.e. the primary diagnostic criteria are identical). The group was concerned that these divisions are dependent on nebulous definitions of what constitutes "major nerve damage", and regarding what tests or criteria were necessary to make this distinction (e.g. electrodiagnosis, which is almost always too painful). Despite agreement that the CRPS-Type I vs. Type II distinction may neither be clinically significant nor affect the specific therapeutic method used, this distinction was retained by the Budapest group largely for historical reasons, and remains a formal subtype in the 2012 IASP CRPS criteria and the CRPS criteria to be included in the new ICD-11, pending more data.

While the contribution of psychophysiological interactions to CRPS is largely speculative, it is theoretically consistent and highlights the importance of addressing psychological factors in the clinical management of CRPS. A vicious cycle in which pain provokes disuse and emotional arousal, both of which in turn further exacerbate the pain, could contribute to maintenance of CRPS. Psychological/behavioral treatments may therefore play an important role in CRPS management by targeting learned disuse and both life stress and negative affect that may contribute to maintenance or exacerbation of the disorder. Consistent with potential benefits of this treatment focus, a prospective study (level 3) in acute CRPS patients found that greater baseline anxiety and pain-related fear predicted worse treatment outcomes in terms of pain and disability over the following 12 months, suggesting that early targeting of these issues may have long-term benefits. Psychological treatments can also enhance pain coping skills that ultimately lead to improved functioning and quality of life and increase ability to self-manage pain. In line with this, an electronic diary study showed that in CRPS patients, greater engagement in pain acceptance-based coping (a core tenet of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [ACT]) was linked to same-day improvements in pain and mood. At minimum, psychological treatments focusing on the issues above are likely to enhance patients' sense of control over the condition, and thereby reduce fears that may be a barrier to achieving success in functional therapies.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type I with bisphosphonates [^1173MsAR]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) is a common and disabling disorder affecting a peripheral limb, usually developing after a trauma to an extremity. CRPS-I is characterised by presence of spontaneous pain, allodynia and hyperalgesia, disproportionate to the inciting event and by a variety of autonomic disturbances and trophic abnormalities. The pathophysiology of CRPS-I has not been fully understood. Experimental models have suggested that an initial triggering event may produce the release of proinflammatory neuropeptides and cytokines, generating a sort of neurogenic inflammation. Thereafter, increased microvascular permeability and intramedullary pressure, reduced oxygen extraction and cellular hypoxia maintain and make the disease worse, producing metabolic tissue acidosis. In this context, it is probable that, far from being a key player, the sympathetic nervous system contributes interacting with these mechanisms and producing vasomotor disturbances. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclastic activity widely used for the management of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. Their primary pharmacological action is the reduction of bone turnover. An enhanced osteoclastic activity has never been clearly demonstrated in CRPS-I. Therefore, it is likely that the positive effects of BPs in this condition are not related to their antiresorptive properties, but to a more complex interaction between these pharmacological agents and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CRPS-I. Results of several clinical trials have suggested the potential beneficial effects of BPs in CRPS-I. In five randomised controlled trials, oral and intravenous alendronate and intravenous clodronate, pamidronate and neridronate demonstrated to be effective in reducing pain and improving physical function in patients presenting with CRPS-I, with a good profile of safety and tolerability. Although these trials have a number of limitations, including the small samples enrolled, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of BPs as agents of choice in the management of CRPS-I.

As CRPS remains a diagnosis primarily based on clinical features, internationally recognized diagnostic and research criteria, the Budapest Criteria, were developed by an expert panel to improve recognition of this syndrome. Treatments recommended include physical therapy, pharmacological therapy, psychological treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), nerve blocks, and neuromodulation. The success of these therapies is variable and often unsatisfactory, especially if the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Healthcare providers (HCPs) currently use a variety of drugs to treat CRPS, including antidepressants, anti-inflammatory agents, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs, ketamine, N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and opioids. However, although there is a strong evidence base for some drugs (eg, bisphosphonates), there is a general lack of scientific evidence supporting the use of many drugs used to reduce pain and improve functional status in CRPS. Treatment choices may be influenced by the type of CRPS. CRPS Type 1, formerly known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), is a syndrome that usually develops after a noxious or traumatic event (ie, fracture or surgery) resulting in pain which is disproportionate to the event. Complications include tissue atrophy and muscle contracture accompanied by unremitting pain. CRPS, in the absence of nerve injury, is commonly referred to in medical literature as Type I as the vast majority of patients diagnosed with the condition have this type of CRPS. It has an incidence rate of 5.46 per 100,000 person-years.CRPS Type II, formerly known as causalgia, has symptoms similar to those of CRPS Type 1. However, Type II also has evidence of nerve damage (typically resulting from injury to a peripheral nerve). Additionally, Type II CRPS tends to feature the more painful (usually burning pain) and difficult-to-control symptoms of CRPS; it has an incidence rate of 0.82 per 100,000 person years.CRPS not otherwise specified is the type that partially meets CRPS criteria and is not better explained by any other condition.

A second aspect of the pain management treatment component is cognitive intervention. Given the emphasis in consensus guidelines for CRPS management using an active rehabilitation approach, it is important to reframe the CRPS patient's role as that of an active participant in the treatment process rather than a passive recipient of treatment interventions. As part of this active treatment focus, pain exacerbations should be identified as a cue to practice self-management interventions that may help the patient gain control over their situation. As patients learn relaxation skills and begin to understand the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the syndrome, they will have increasing resources for exerting at least some degree of control over their CRPS. Increased sense of perceived control, even if that control is limited in scope, may be an important factor in determining outcomes in chronic pain treatment [e.g. Andrasik and Holroyd). Dysfunctional cognitions may be common in CRPS patients, including catastrophic interpretations about symptoms or implications of CRPS for the future, fearful pain-related cognitions like those described above, and unrealistic beliefs about treatment. Such cognitions contribute to elevated distress, which may impact sympathetic outflow and catecholamine release, and potentially aggravate CRPS pain and vasomotor changes. Moreover, in the absence of in vivo reactivation experiments in which constructive (i.e. encouraging rather than catastrophic) self-talk is practiced, fear of pain may prevent improved daily function even in the face of objectively improved capabilities during therapy. It is therefore important that cognitive interventions be employed to help patients learn to identify and modify their specific dysfunctional cognitions regarding reactivation, CRPS, and its treatment.

CRPS-type I or causalgia is a challenging pain syndrome and its pathogenesis remains controversial. Although its incidence is relatively low, the pain and suffering it causes can be severe and functionally debilitating.

Assessment of the cognitive impact of CRPS should include thorough exploration of the patient's beliefs regarding CRPS. Several misconceptions are common among patients, particularly those who have failed previous treatments. For example, patients may believe that CRPS is an untreatable, progressively deteriorating condition, and that it will necessarily spread throughout the body (a belief not supported by empirical studies). Catastrophic cognitions such as these are often a contributor to negative emotional states that may have a deleterious impact on CRPS and responses to treatment. The importance of addressing catastrophic cognitions in CRPS treatment is highlighted by results of a prospective study in non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients, which indicated that level of catastrophizing at study baseline predicted level of pain eight weeks later, independent of baseline pain and depression. Patients may also possess incorrect beliefs regarding the meaning of CRPS pain. Not surprisingly given the intensity and unusual nature of allodynic pain, patients may assume that pain signals damage, and as a corollary, "if it hurts, don't do it". Such beliefs may be a primary contributor to pain-related fear, and consequently, exacerbate disuse (kinesiophobia). It is therefore important that patients understand that CRPS pain does not signal tissue damage. Unrealistic beliefs regarding how CRPS treatment should progress may also be problematic. Common misconceptions include beliefs that sympathetic blocks alone are curative, and that treatments that exacerbate pain temporarily cannot contribute to long-term improvements. Invasive and expensive interventional procedures, such as spinal cord stimulation, may prove valuable for some patients in the later stages of treatment. However, excessive focus early in treatment upon invasive interventions viewed as a "quick fix" before patients have participated in a comprehensive interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary program leads to reduced motivation to engage actively in such care, and outcomes are likely to suffer. The importance of considering treatment expectations is underscored by recent qualitative research examining the content of CRPS internet message boards, which found that many CRPS patients have unrealistic expectations regarding likely outcomes of medical interventions for CRPS.
