## Question

When to do allergy testing pediatrics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to do allergy testing in pediatrics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anchoring the decision in a careful, allergy-focused history. Then, I should verify which test types match the suspected mechanism (IgE-mediated vs delayed) and clinical question. Next, I will review food allergy indications, including the narrow exceptions for pre-ingestion testing in high-risk infants. After that, I need to examine inhalant allergy testing in asthma and rhinitis and clarify when it changes management. I will then assess contact dermatitis and when to patch test. Finally, I should cover drug allergy, particularly penicillin delabeling, and synthesize age-specific considerations and follow-up intervals with shared decision-making in mind [^1136cv2U] [^11539aMv].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: testing without a compatible history risks false positives and mislabeling; I need to ensure that the history establishes a temporal relationship between exposure and symptoms and excludes nonallergic mimics before ordering any test, because sensitization is not equivalent to clinical allergy and pretest probability drives diagnostic value [^111sLgSY] [^114ft5BY] [^115W9pHo].

> I will now examine the role of the history and how it directs test selection; acute IgE-mediated reactions typically occur within minutes to a couple of hours after exposure, whereas delayed eczematous or gastrointestinal symptoms point to non–IgE-mediated or mixed mechanisms, and in chronic presentations like persistent eczema or suspected drug allergy, I should confirm the timing, morphology, associated features, and any plausible cofactors such as infections before choosing SPT/sIgE versus patch testing or drug challenge strategies [^115vF4r4] [^112tXM7L] [^1178UoNA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; for suspected IgE-mediated food allergy, I should verify that SPT or sIgE are only used for foods with a plausible history, not as broad panels, and I need to plan for a supervised oral food challenge when the history is discordant with test results because that remains the diagnostic gold standard, especially in infants and young children where thresholds vary and sensitization without reactivity is common [^115Z4Kfp] [^115W9pHo] [^115vF4r4].

> Wait, let me verify the pre-ingestion testing exception; for infants 4–6 months with severe eczema and/or egg allergy, I should consider pre-introduction peanut SPT or sIgE in accordance with NIAID addendum guidance to stratify risk and guide early introduction, but I need to ensure this does not generalize to screening all infants, as testing before eating a food is otherwise discouraged due to poor specificity and the risk of delaying introduction unnecessarily [^112aUCQM] [^111HUVL7] [^111CKZn4].

> Let me think about food-triggered atopic dermatitis; I should confirm persistent, moderate-to-severe AD despite optimized topical therapy and a credible immediate reaction history before pursuing limited food testing (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, soy), recognizing the high false-positive rate in AD and planning for OFC to establish true causality rather than relying on SPT/sIgE alone [^113PS41p] [^116Xpoih] [^1157SH8S].

> I need to check the timing and scope of follow-up; children with confirmed food allergy should be reassessed periodically because tolerance can develop, with more frequent testing every 1–2 years early in life and spacing out to every 2–3 years for persistent allergens like peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, and I should align the cadence with age, specific food, and trajectory of sIgE or SPT size to guide safe dietary expansion [^113P97hr] [^11539aMv].

> But wait, what if the presentation is respiratory; for asthma in children aged 5–16 years, I should double-check that ERS recommends against routine SPT or sIgE for aeroallergens in the diagnostic workup because it does not change initial asthma diagnosis or management, although identifying clinically relevant sensitizations may be useful when considering allergen avoidance counseling or subcutaneous immunotherapy once asthma control is optimized and a compatible exposure–symptom relationship is established [^111mTSF7] [^1167UVNs] [^114SnmZn].

> Let me reconsider rhinitis and conjunctivitis; when symptoms are refractory to empiric therapy or when immunotherapy is contemplated, targeted SPT or sIgE can be reasonable to identify relevant aeroallergens, but I should confirm that results are interpreted in light of seasonal patterns and local aerobiology rather than ordering indiscriminate panels [^1147AT2D] [^11365Cjc].

> Next, I should review allergic contact dermatitis; if there is recalcitrant dermatitis, distribution suggestive of external exposures, or worsening with emollients or topical therapies, I need to ensure patch testing with a pediatric baseline series plus history-directed add-ons is considered, ideally with delayed readings to capture late and relevant reactions, while avoiding testing during widespread active eczema flares when possible [^112tXM7L] [^117HnUZk] [^116Prnqu].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to suspected penicillin allergy; for low-risk histories such as remote benign cutaneous-only reactions, I should recommend direct amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing, whereas for high-risk features such as anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or organ involvement, I need to refer for specialist evaluation with appropriate testing and, if indicated, graded challenge, and I should remember that delabeling improves antibiotic stewardship and is safe when done per guideline risk stratification [^114DyPSt] [^1178UoNA] [^1136cv2U].

> I will now examine age-specific considerations; in infants and very young children, I should limit the number of allergens tested to those with plausible exposures and mechanisms, focusing on foods and early indoor aeroallergens, and I need to ensure fresh extracts or prick-to-prick testing for certain plant foods when available extracts may be inadequate, keeping in mind that very young infants rarely mount robust pollen sensitization and that testing logistics must be age-appropriate [^1173WRTR] [^115vMKzJ] [^114u5vnK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that component testing would help in all infants; I should correct that — component testing can refine risk for some foods like peanut in older children with suggestive histories, but in high-risk infants being considered for early introduction, component testing has not shown added value and should not be used routinely, reinforcing the primacy of history plus SPT/sIgE within guideline-directed pathways [^112XAZoB] [^111CKZn4].

> Next, I should review interpretation and communication; I need to explain to families that SPT wheal size and sIgE levels are probabilistic, not dichotomous, and that small wheals or modest sIgE may be clinically meaningful in some contexts while large values do not predict severity, which supports cautious, shared decision-making around oral food challenges and ongoing avoidance until the risk–benefit profile favors introduction [^114ft5BY] [^115W9pHo] [^115vF4r4].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach; I should confirm a compatible history first, then select SPT or sIgE when results will change management, reserve patch testing for suspected contact dermatitis, use direct drug challenge for low-risk penicillin labels, and proceed to supervised oral food challenge when history and testing are discordant, while avoiding screening panels or testing before first exposure outside of the narrow high-risk infant exception for peanut, and I should document a plan for periodic reassessment of food allergy and for re-testing or delabeling of drug allergy after tolerated exposures [^115vF4r4] [^1178UoNA] [^113P97hr].

Allergy testing in children should be guided by **clinical history and pretest probability** [^116n7b8a] to confirm suspected IgE-mediated allergy and to inform management. Use **skin prick testing (SPT) or serum-specific IgE** [^1118rSHH] when history suggests a high likelihood of allergy or before oral food challenges, and avoid routine screening in low-probability scenarios [^1118rSHH]. Patch testing is reserved for suspected allergic contact dermatitis [^112tXM7L] [^114y2kxh]. Testing is not routinely indicated for asthma or chronic urticaria without a supportive history, and results must always be interpreted in clinical context [^111mTSF7] [^114ft5BY].

---

## Indications for allergy testing in children

Allergy testing is indicated when the **clinical history suggests an allergic etiology** [^111sLgSY] and results will change management. Common scenarios include:

- **IgE-mediated food allergy**: Suspected reactions to foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, milk, egg, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish [^114u5vnK] [^113jtGZx].

- **Allergic rhinitis and asthma**: Suspected sensitization to aeroallergens (pollens, dust mites, animal dander, molds) when results will guide avoidance or immunotherapy [^117Jb2G6] [^114SnmZn].

- **Allergic contact dermatitis**: Suspected contact allergens (e.g. nickel, fragrances, preservatives, topical medications) [^112WYSmH] [^114y2kxh].

- **Drug allergy**: Suspected IgE-mediated reactions to antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) or other medications [^114DyPSt] [^1178UoNA].

---

## Timing of allergy testing

The timing of allergy testing depends on the child's age, clinical presentation, and suspected allergen. For **infants and toddlers (< 2 years)**, SPT or sIgE can be performed if IgE-mediated allergy is suspected, as sensitization can occur early [^1173WRTR]; in contrast, for **older children (≥ 2 years)**, testing is guided by clinical history and exposure patterns, with patch testing considered for suspected contact dermatitis [^112tXM7L].

---

## Types of allergy tests

| **Test type** | **Indication** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Skin prick test (SPT) | IgE-mediated allergy to foods, aeroallergens, some drugs | Prick/puncture skin test | Positive wheal/flare indicates sensitization; correlate with history [^114ft5BY] [^1163XCVD] |
| Serum-specific IgE | IgE-mediated allergy to foods, aeroallergens | Blood test | Quantitative IgE levels; higher values increase likelihood of clinical allergy [^114tisL6] [^114ft5BY] |
| Patch test | Allergic contact dermatitis | Application of allergens to skin | Positive reaction indicates contact sensitization [^114y2kxh] |
| Oral food challenge (OFC) | Definitive diagnosis of food allergy | Supervised ingestion | Gold standard; negative challenge rules out allergy [^1126Xp2p] [^115W9pHo] |

---

## Situations where allergy testing is not recommended

Allergy testing should not be performed routinely in the following situations:

- **Asthma without allergic features**: Routine allergy testing is not recommended for asthma without a supportive allergic history [^111mTSF7] [^1167UVNs].

- **Chronic urticaria**: Testing is not indicated unless there is a clear history suggesting an allergic trigger [^notfound].

- **Low pretest probability**: Testing is discouraged when the likelihood of allergy is low, as false positives are common [^116n7b8a] [^11791UMA].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric allergy testing

- **Age-specific allergen panels**: Younger children are typically sensitized to fewer allergens; panels should be tailored accordingly [^1173WRTR] [^114u5vnK].

- **Interpretation of results**: Positive test results indicate sensitization but not necessarily clinical allergy; results must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history [^111sLgSY] [^114ft5BY].

- **Safety**: SPT and OFCs should be performed by trained professionals, with emergency equipment available [^115W9pHo].

---

## Follow-up and re-evaluation

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor tolerance development and adjust management; **re-evaluation** is recommended every 1–2 years for milk, egg, wheat, and soy, and every 2–3 years for peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish [^113P97hr] [^11539aMv].

---

Allergy testing in children should be **guided by clinical history and pretest probability** [^116n7b8a], using SPT or sIgE to confirm suspected IgE-mediated allergy and to inform management. Patch testing is reserved for suspected allergic contact dermatitis [^112tXM7L]. Testing is not routinely indicated for asthma or chronic urticaria without a supportive history, and results must always be interpreted in clinical context [^111mTSF7] [^114ft5BY].

Pediatric allergic contact dermatitis (Ped-ACD) is an increasingly recognized highly prevalent skin disease that has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. Accurate and appropriate patch testing is vital to diagnosing Ped-ACD. This requires knowledge of the most common allergens in the pediatric population, consideration of concurrent diseases that can complicate the clinical picture, and potential modification of techniques to lessen exposure to irritants and sensitizers while obtaining true positive results. This article reviews the most common pediatric allergens and discusses considerations when performing pediatric patch testing.

Food-related symptoms are frequent in childhood, and pediatricians are often requested to initiate a food allergy diagnostic workup. A careful history is the cornerstone for assessing whether tests are needed and which diagnostic procedures are most appropriate. Skin prick tests should be performed only according to standard procedures by a skilled health professional. Determining serum IgE levels (in vitro tests) are available for a wide range of foods. Of utmost importance is the need to correlate test results to the clinical picture. When a conclusion cannot be reached, oral food challenges should be performed for a definite diagnosis.

### Diagnosis of allergy syndromes: do symptoms always mean allergy? [^113ZfNZr]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic disease has become a major burden in westernized societies because of a recent rise in its prevalence. Approximately one-third of children suffer from an allergic disease, with the prevalence varying from 15 to 20% for atopic dermatitis, 7 to 10% for asthma and 15 to 20% for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Despite the increase, it is important not to assume a diagnosis of allergy on the basis of symptoms alone, because allergic and nonallergic conditions may present with similar symptoms. An accurate allergy diagnosis is important in order to treat the patient most appropriately and to potentially prevent or delay the development of allergic disease. A good clinical history is the starting point for accurate allergy diagnosis but is not unequivocal. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology has recognized the importance of allergy testing and therefore developed evidence-based recommendations on allergy testing in children. Widespread adherence to these recommendations should improve the quality of care for allergy patients. Cooperation between all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of allergy patients is also a key to improve our response to the allergy epidemic.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^1113Zh75]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the burden of disease and the consequences of a diagnosis of peanut allergy, it is important that peanut allergy be accurately diagnosed so that an appropriate treatment plan can be developed. However, a test that indicates there is peanut sensitization present (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity. This practice parameter addresses the diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy, both in children and adults, as pertaining to 3 fundamental questions, and based on the systematic reviews and meta-analyses, makes recommendations for the clinician who is evaluating a patient for peanut allergy. These questions relate to when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

Peanut allergy diagnosis — 2020 practice parameter update highlights that immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated peanut allergy has an estimated prevalence of between 0.2% and 4.5%, with U.S. prevalence appearing to have tripled in a recent 10-year period while the United Kingdom has plateaued; peanut allergy carries substantial economic and psychologic burden, is often severe and usually lifelong, and is a leading cause of food-related anaphylaxis. The parameter emphasizes that a test indicating peanut sensitization (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity, and it makes recommendations — based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses — for clinicians evaluating children and adults, focusing on when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

Regarding preventative measures for food allergy, more specifically with respect to early introduction of foods, NIAID 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining peanut-specific IgE measurement, skin prick test, or both, in infants with severe eczema or egg allergy before the introduction of peanut to determine if peanut should be introduced and, if so, the preferred method of introduction. Consider preferring peanut-specific IgE testing as the initial approach in certain health care settings, such as family medicine, pediatrics, or dermatology practices, in which skin prick testing is not routine, to minimize a delay in peanut introduction in children who may test negative. Consider referring for assessment by a specialist if desired and when available in a timely manner.

Conclusions

Good-quality evidence is lacking to support the use of diagnostic tests in childhood asthma. Discrepant guideline recommendations based on the same evidence may contribute to poor clinician adherence to asthma guidelines and variation in testing practices. Therefore, guideline bodies should prioritise evidence to address the essential gaps and employ rigorous methods to identify all the best available evidence when making diagnostic recommendations for children with asthma.

### Question 6: what is the use of allergy testing in children with asthma? [^117Jb2G6]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Disagreement exists between asthma guidelines on the routine use of allergy testing in the diagnostic work-up of a child with persistent asthma, although the important role of inhalant allergy in the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis is undisputed. The usefulness of screening for inhalant allergies in asthma is connected to the efficacy of allergen reduction measures and specific immunotherapy, both of which appear to be more effective in children than in adults. Allergen-specific exposure reduction recommendations are therefore an essential part of childhood asthma management. Such recommendations should be guided by appropriate diagnosis of inhalant allergy, based on a structured allergy history and results of sensitization tests. Specific IgE testing and skin prick testing show comparable results in identifying clinically important sensitizations. Although a therapeutic medication trial can be started pragmatically in children with asthma without diagnosing their inhalant allergy, we recommend making or excluding an accurate diagnosis of inhalant allergy.

### Should testing be initiated prior to amoxicillin challenge in children? [^115RgW95]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is the most common antibiotic prescribed in children with increasing use over time. While up to 10% of children are labelled as amoxicillin allergic, most children can tolerate amoxicillin after allergy evaluation. It is well documented that the label of amoxicillin allergy in children is associated with adverse health outcomes such as antibiotic-resistant infections. However, it remains controversial how best to assess children for amoxicillin allergy. While in general it is recommended that skin testing be done prior to drug provocation test in the evaluation of amoxicillin allergy, there is increasing evidence that drug provocation testing could be done in lower risk children without skin testing prior. The goal of this article as a narrative review is to review the strengths and limitations of skin testing prior to drug provocation test in children who have a history of either immediate or non-immediate, reactions to amoxicillin.

### How to interpret skin prick tests and serum-specific IgE in children and young people with food allergy [^113zEVZv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is common, it can lead to significant morbidity andnegatively impacts on quality of life; therefore, it is vitally important we get the diagnosis right. However, making the diagnosis can be complex. Clinical history is the most important diagnostic tool and subsequent investigation may help confirm the diagnosis. The investigations available to most paediatric departments are skin prick testing and specific IgE so we will focus on these. Within this article we explore the evidence related to targeted testing and how to interpret these within the clinical context.

### Should younger siblings of peanut allergic children Be screened for peanut allergy? [^115f4Qka]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The role of screening younger siblings of peanut allergic children with allergy testing before peanut introduction is controversial. Although certain guidelines note some value in screening this population, it is not a direct indication in the recent National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guideline. Some studies suggest that siblings of peanut allergic children are at increased risk of peanut allergy, whereas others note that delayed ingestion or mislabeling of allergy in these children may be the main factors accounting for this increased risk. The low risk of severe reaction with first ingestion and risks of pre-emptive testing must be balanced against data suggesting that families are reluctant to introduce peanut in siblings without testing. The goal of this article is to critically appraise the debated issues in this topic, providing a practical approach to this common clinical dilemma.

### History and utility of specific IgE cutoff levels: what is the relevance for allergy diagnosis? [^114ft5BY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergy is defined clinically, by symptoms on allergen exposure. A patient is considered sensitized when allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) antibody can be detected in serum or plasma or a skin test result is positive, even if no clinical reaction has been experienced. Sensitization should be regarded as a requisite and risk factor for allergy but is not synonymous with an allergy diagnosis. To provide a correct allergy diagnosis, test results regarding allergen-sIgE must always be considered in view of the patient's case history and clinical observations. Correct assessment of a patient's sensitization to specific allergens relies on the use of accurate and quantitative methods for detection of sIgE antibodies. The evolution of sIgE immunoassays toward higher analytical performance and the use of different cutoff levels in the interpretation of test results sometimes cause confusion. Earlier versions of sIgE assays offered a limit of quantitation of 0.35 kilounits of sIgE per liter (kU A /L), which also became an established cutoff level for a positive test result in the clinical use of the assays. Current sIgE assays are capable of reliably measuring sIgE levels as low as 0.1 kU A /L and can thereby demonstrate sensitization in cases in which previous assays could not. When the outcome of sIgE test results is evaluated, it is critically important to distinguish between the analytical data as such and their clinical interpretation. Even though sIgE may be present in the absence of symptoms of allergy, available information suggests that sIgE concentrations between 0.1 kU A /L and 0.35 kU A /L may be clinically relevant in some individuals, not least among children, although this should be further evaluated for various allergies. Moreover, it is becoming widely adopted that nondichotomous interpretation of sIgE levels may offer a diagnostic benefit compared with using a predefined cutoff level.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1173WRTR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric skin testing — extent of testing notes that generally fewer prick/puncture tests need to be performed in infants and very young children (< 2 years of age) because they are not likely to be sensitized to as many allergens as older children and adults, and that in toddlers sensitization is more apt to reflect early-life exposures such as foods, house dust mites, indoor molds, and animal danders rather than pollen.

### Patch testing: uses, systems, risks / benefits, and its role in managing the patient with contact dermatitis [^114y2kxh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patch testing is the gold standard diagnostic tool for cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity reactions like allergic contact dermatitis. Sensitized individuals have primed antigen-specific T lymphocytes that cause a reaction when antigens are applied to the skin owing to prior sensitization. Patch testing can be used in the adult and pediatric populations, but it is contraindicated in patients with a known history of severe allergic reactions to suspected allergens, generalized active dermatitis, or extensive eczema. Patch test systems can be a comprehensive panel (70–80 allergens), but they can also be targeted and limited to a more common allergen series (35 allergens). The decision for allergen selection should be based on an accurate patient history, physical examination, and availability of allergens. Measurement and interpretation of the test results requires training and experience, as well as consideration of relevance and clinical history. Patch testing is generally considered safe with just a few known complications: excited skin syndrome, active sensitization, and rarely anaphylaxis or other cutaneous complications. Appropriately pretesting patient education can help to mitigate some of these complications. Based on patch testing results, patients should be educated regarding proper allergen avoidance measures to resolve symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis.

### Outcomes of pediatric patients with suspected allergies to COVID-19 vaccines [^111gb8yg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with suspected vaccine allergies should be evaluated by experienced clinicians. The diagnostic approach can include skin testing for immediate allergic reactions, whereas individuals with local or mild delayed reactions should proceed with the next dose. Negative skin test results indicate low risk, whereas supervised graded challenge can be offered to patients with positive results. Few vaccination reactions, aside from anaphylaxis and life-threatening delayed hypersensitivities, are considered absolute contraindications. However, the testing process can be labor-intensive and may induce anxiety, especially in children. The diagnostic accuracy of skin testing for COVID-19 vaccines has not been established, as some reactions have not been reproducible — perhaps because some immediate reactions to mRNA-based vaccines were not IgE-mediated but instead occurred via the Mas-related G protein–coupled receptor member X2 pathway. These mechanisms and outcomes of diagnostic investigations remain mostly unknown.

We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of children referred to 2 tertiary allergy centers for concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine allergy, with the hypothesis that vaccine-naive individuals would tolerate vaccination without severe reactions, whereas COVID-19–related AEFIs following revaccination consist mostly of flare or new-onset chronic urticaria or eczematous dermatitis.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^116MPpre]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy testing exceptions and screening — "A major possible exception are high-risk infants being considered for early peanut introduction". As per the 2017 NIAID addendum, "a special case may be made for screening infants who present with egg allergy and/or severe atopic dermatitis in the first 4 to 6 months of life", and "the prior NIAID guideline did recommend strong consideration that either peanut SPT or sIgE testing be obtained and interpreted before early peanut introduction in these infants"; however, "outside of this very circumscribed group, there are otherwise no formal recommendations that any individual should have peanut SPT or sIgE testing before peanut introduction specifically as a screening measure for risk assessment". Historically, testing children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis to "the 8 common food allergens" without prior consumption "has largely fallen out of favor", diagnostic tests used as screening are "poorly specific" and of "optimal utility in the setting of high pretest probability", and "Asymptomatic, clinically irrelevant peanut sensitization is not uncommon".

### Practical aspects of allergy-testing [^1163XCVD]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Allergy-testing is a prerequisite for specific allergy treatment, including specific allergen avoidance measures, relevant pharmacotherapy and specific allergy vaccination. All children with persisting, recurrent or severe possible "allergic symptoms" or those with a need for continuous treatment should be tested, irrespective of the child's age. Allergy-testing includes a careful case history and a determination of IgE sensitisation by skin prick test or the measurement of allergen-specific IgE in serum by standardised and validated methods. The diagnosis of food allergy cannot usually be based solely on the case history and IgE sensitisation; the diagnosis has to be confirmed by controlled food elimination and food challenge procedures. The diagnosis of inhalant allergic disease requires only confirmatory nasal, conjunctival or bronchial challenges in equivocal cases or before specific allergy treatment such as extensive allergen avoidance measures or allergy vaccination.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^112DKuqG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for peanut allergy, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, AAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining peanut allergy testing in patients < 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and either:

- persistent atopic dermatitis despite optimized treatment

- reliable history of immediate reaction after ingestion of peanuts or peanut-containing food.

### EAACI guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^11539aMv]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for food allergy, more specifically with respect to clinical follow-up, EAACI 2023 guidelines recommend to consider reassessing pediatric patients with food allergy at regular intervals, depending on age, food, and patient history, to identify possible development of spontaneous tolerance.

### Allergy testing in childhood: using allergen-specific IgE tests [^111sLgSY]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of triggers can induce common pediatric allergic diseases which include asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and anaphylaxis. Allergy testing serves to confirm an allergic trigger suspected on the basis of history. Tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) are performed by in vitro assays or skin tests. The tests are excellent for identifying a sensitized state in which allergen-specific IgE is present, and may identify triggers to be eliminated and help guide immunotherapy treatment. However, a positive test result does not always equate with clinical allergy. Newer enzymatic assays based on anti-IgE antibodies have supplanted the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). This clinical report focuses on allergen-specific IgE testing, emphasizing that the medical history and knowledge of disease characteristics are crucial for rational test selection and interpretation.

Peanut allergy diagnosis — GRADE PICO questions and study population are defined for the systematic review: Three prespecified PICO format questions were formulated, and included studies evaluated patients with known or highly suspected peanut allergy who underwent oral food challenge (OFC) in ≥ 50% of participants with serologic peanut component testing (Ara h 1, 2, 3, 6, 8) and/or skin prick test (SPT) or specific IgE (sIgE) to whole peanut. The first question asks whether diagnostic testing for peanut allergy should be performed in adults and children with a history of suspected peanut allergy who are requesting evaluation for peanut allergy. The second question asks, in patients presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the three tests — SPT, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h 2 — provides the highest diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio. A related question examines whether testing for peanut components in addition to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increases diagnostic accuracy, with the intervention specified as using peanut component testing, such as Ara h 2, in addition to SPT or sIgE whole peanut and the comparator as use of OFC. The third question asks whether the results of a diagnostic test can be used to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction in adults and children presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy.

### Patch testing: another steroid-sparing agent to consider in children [^115KEGqw]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The burden of children suffering from chronic severe dermatitis and especially from undiagnosed confounding allergic contact dermatitis can be overwhelming for not only the patients and their families but also for their dermatologists. We report our protocol for pediatric patch testing and three pediatric cases, with severe and recalcitrant dermatitis unresponsive to systemic therapies, in whom comprehensive patch testing played a key role in management. Comprehensive patch testing allowed for the culprit allergens to be detected and subsequently avoided. With strict compliance, we were able to cease the use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. These cases illustrate the importance of patch testing in recalcitrant dermatitis within the pediatric population.

Key messages

The quality of childhood asthma diagnostic guidelines is highly variable.
The evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations is generally of very poor quality.
There is discrepant advice on recommended diagnostic tests and thresholds across guidelines.
Better evidence needs to be generated for existing and emerging diagnostic strategies.
GPs should refer for spirometry and reversibility testing to evaluate children ≥ 5 years.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^111HUbMK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy testing — preference-sensitive scenarios (Table III) presents situations of low to moderate pretest probability where testing may be a preference-sensitive care option to offer in the evaluation of a patient, including a young child > 1 y but < 3 y with multiple asthma hospitalizations, on chronic inhaled steroids, with known milk allergy who has not yet tried peanut, and a 6-month-old child with mild eczema tolerating a milk-based formula who has not tried egg or peanut and whose older sibling has milk, egg, and peanut allergy. For the sibling scenario, pros include that parents may be reluctant to introduce peanut without a negative test leading to additional risk from delayed introduction, whereas cons note that it is unclear whether the absolute risk is elevated more than the low probability scenario of a 30% pretest probability where a positive test was not shown to appreciably shift the posttest odds, that by NIAID addendum criteria the eczema does not place this child at high risk, and that recent data show testing the younger sibling is not cost-effective until the prevalence of peanut allergy in siblings is shown to be > 11% and all such screened children also undergo an OFC to provide a definitive outcome; the table states these are hypothetical examples and that the choice of specific allergens, ages, and comorbidities are for illustration purposes only.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^114DyPSt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric penicillin allergy — direct amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing is endorsed with strong recommendation for benign cutaneous histories, and single-dose challenge is recommended for limited, non-severe rashes. The guideline states: "We recommend against penicillin skin testing prior to direct amoxicillin challenge in pediatric patients with a history of benign cutaneous reaction (such as MDE or urticaria)", with "Strength of Recommendation: Strong" and "Certainty of Evidence: Moderate". For appropriate presentations, "single-dose amoxicillin challenge without prior allergy testing is recommended", although "the safety of this approach has not been thoroughly examined in primary care settings", and "penicillin skin testing may be performed at the discretion of the clinician". While skin testing may "overdiagnose" because the "PPV [is] < 100%", not testing and hence not challenging means " ≥ 90% of the patients will continue to be falsely labeled as penicillin-allergic".

### Delabeling, safety, and impact of β-lactam allergy testing: a systematic review [^117Gw5dU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Our systematic review was limited by the large amount of missing data, as well as by inconsistent reporting of the procedures, reagents, and outcomes of the studies. The studies also looked at significantly different populations and thus cannot be analyzed in a more rigorous manner. Additionally, results were often reported for the cohort as a whole, without differentiation between those who initially presented with immediate versus nonimmediate reactions. Given the anticipation that these 2 populations would differ greatly with regard to testing results, it is difficult to assess the significance of these studies. Future studies should be clear with regard to the population being assessed. If it is a mixed population, we suggest separate reporting based on historical reactions.

There is a need for future studies to look at the value of skin testing in patients with β-lactam allergy, including studies in which all participants undergo skin prick testing, intradermal testing, and direct provocation tests to assess the true utility of skin testing in the β-lactam allergy algorithm. Current clinical guidelines, suggest that those who are considered low-risk on the basis of our clinical history undergo direct provocation testing without skin testing, but this suggestion is based on an incomplete data base. To improve guidelines, we require studies that more rigorously assess for those who would be considered being at moderate or high risk in a trial in which individuals are randomized to direct provocation testing with or without preceding skin testing. Reporting on these trials needs to be clear, comprehensive, and uniform so that we can build a strong evidence base on which to build changes in our field.

It is also recognized that pediatric and adult presentations can differ significantly, and our data suggest that issues such as anaphylaxis are more common in adults. There remain concerns about subjecting children to inappropriate painful skin and intradermal tests, which may limit the number of suggested reagents and dilutions. It is also suggested that children and adults be assessed separately so that the true risk of these procedures can be better appreciated.

An updated search of publications (using the same search strategy) between April 2018 and December 2022 found 27 articles with a total of 5301 participants that met our criteria. None of these studies were randomized; all of them were retrospective, and they were not additive to the current review. The literature needs to be scrutinized at regular intervals, and ideally, this review could form the basis for a living systematic review.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^111jMVZ9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Practical diagnostic pathway

There are 4 key steps in our practical pathway:
1 Clinical history.
2 Sensitization assessment.
3 Oral food challenge.
4 Diagnosis.

In this section, we describe each of these steps, including when to test and how to interpret the test results.

Step 1: Clinical history

Why

People suspected of food allergy can present with a variety of symptoms affecting the skin (urticaria, angioedema, atopic eczema/dermatitis), gastrointestinal (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), respiratory (rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, dyspnea), and cardiovascular systems (circulatory collapse). These symptoms can also be nonallergic or caused by other conditions, which need to be considered before diagnosing food allergy. This means it is essential to take a careful clinical history as well as an allergy-focused diet history (Fig 2). The aim is to link allergic symptoms to the foods ingested and to consider the likelihood of food allergy. Taking a diet history can also help to distinguish primary food allergy versus food allergy that results from cross-reactions with pollens.

Fig 2
Things to consider in clinical and nutritional history.

Eczema is a special situation because many children with food allergy have eczema. Those with eczema may be suspected of having food allergy, even though eczema is usually not caused by food allergies. It can be difficult to distinguish between those who have food allergies that affect eczema and those who do not, so guidelines suggest that food allergy should be explored in children with severe persistent eczema and possible food allergy symptoms, especially if combined with other atopic manifestations.

How

Box 1 lists practical questions that may be asked during allergy-focused history taking.

Box 1
Questions to ask during allergy-focused history taking

Who

Child and adult allergy specialists, pediatricians, internists, nurses, and dieticians can all be trained to take clinical and diet histories. In some countries, primary care team members with special interests may be trained. Patients and their families may be asked to keep food diaries to support history taking.

Step 2: Sensitization

### Pediatric allergic contact dermatitis [^115AA29s]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) affects up to 20% of adults and children, although children are infrequently patch tested. Available data suggest that children and adults, with or without atopic dermatitis, have the same prevalence of ACD. Patch testing is the gold standard for evaluation of ACD. The Pediatric Baseline Series was recently published by expert consensus for use in pediatric patch testing, with additional allergens tested as guided by history. This article examines methods of patch testing and up-to-date data on pediatric ACD. The top allergens are reviewed, and avoidance strategies are discussed.

### Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics [^114vnTkQ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly reported drug allergy in adults and children. More than 95% of those with reported allergy labels to beta lactams are not confirmed when subjected to allergy testing. Beta lactam antibiotics are associated with a wide spectrum of immediate and delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions. The latency period to symptoms and clinical presentation aids in the causality assessment. Risk stratification based on diagnosis and timing then allows for appropriate management and evaluation. Skin prick testing, intradermal testing and oral challenge are well established for evaluation of immediate reactions. Delayed intradermal testing, patch testing and oral challenge can also be considered for evaluation of mild to moderate delayed reactions. Cross-reactivity between beta-lactams appears to be driven most commonly by a shared R1 side-chain. Standardized algorithms, protocols and pathways are needed for widespread implementation of a pragmatic and effective approach to patients reporting beta lactam allergy.

### Management of children with food allergies by allergists in the United States [^113VnNta]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with food allergies is complex because of the multiple factors that need to be considered, including allergen type and severity of food allergies, clinical symptoms, challenges with diagnosis, age, comorbidities, allergen avoidance and nutritional requirements, psychosocial impact, and social determinants of health. Many international guidelines on food allergy management are available, offering evidence-based recommendations for a broad range of health care professionals. Allergists are key in the decision-making process for determining an optimal management strategy for patients with food allergies, especially for patients with multiple and potentially severe food allergies.

Allergists are instrumental in educating patients, caregivers, and other key stakeholders in best practices for managing food allergies, both in the home and in the community, by helping to prevent severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) and monitoring food intake and avoidance. Previous studies have shown that pediatric patients seen by allergists were more likely than those seen by pediatricians to have had diagnostic testing and an epinephrine prescriptionand also that allergist care of patients with food allergies (compared to those without allergist care) may be linked to lower health care costs, suggesting that allergists play a key role in optimal management of patients with food allergies.

Because of the multifactorial nature of food allergies, allergists may face challenges in decision making for their patients with food allergies. We evaluated the management patterns and educational needs of allergists who care for patients with food allergies, using responses from a nationwide survey of United States-based practicing allergists regarding 2 hypothetical pediatric case studies.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^114u5vnK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Foods — Summary Statement 164 states that selection of food tests for IgE-mediated clinical sensitivity is usually tailored to the patient's temporal history, which may be supplemented by a food diary (A). Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to foods may be particularly important in infants and young children, and in children younger than 3 years the most important food allergens include milk, egg white, peanuts, soybean, and wheat; in adults, the prevalence of clinical sensitivity confirmed by double-blind oral food challenge is less than 2%. Nearly any food can be allergenic, cross-reactivity cannot generally be assumed, and lack of reactivity to one botanically related food does not exclude sensitization to another; although many food allergens have been characterized, standardized food extracts are not available. Patient history is important and may be supplemented by a meticulous diary, an approach indicated primarily in patients with the potential for food-induced and food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. When there is no clear-cut history, many clinicians use a limited panel of commonly allergenic foods; exhaustive testing to the 200 or so foods available for skin or specific IgE testing in anaphylaxis presentations is rarely indicated, and the routine use of food prick tests when the history is negative is not justified. Testing may require fresh product or prick-prick testing for many plant-derived foods because allergens are labile and commercially available materials can yield false-negative results due to storage, cooking, or digestion, especially for fruits and berries.

### Pediatric allergic contact dermatitis. part 2: patch testing series, procedure, and unique scenarios [^112tXM7L]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patch testing is the criterion standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. Causative allergens differ between children and adults, necessitating the development of pediatric-specific patch test series. The Pediatric Baseline Series was developed in 2018 through expert consensus and includes relevant pediatric allergens that dermatologists can use in practice. Obstacles in patch testing, such as the need for multiple office visits, length of patch application, and avoidance of sweat and water on the testing area, are particularly challenging for the pediatric population, and several strategies are proposed. Aside from formal patch testing, alternatives like the repeat open application test and empiric allergen avoidance can be helpful in children. The key to management of allergic contact dermatitis is allergen avoidance, with emphasis on the need to properly identify causative allergens. Continued data collection through registries allows for a better understanding of the diagnosis and management of pediatric allergic contact dermatitis.

### Managing younger siblings of food allergic children [^111pKCrc]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend testing siblings of food allergic children before introduction of potential allergic foods, but the topic continues to remain controversial. Although the proportion of siblings who are sensitized to a food without clinical reactivity is high in comparison to those with a true food allergy, there is still a known increased risk amongst siblings of children with food allergies that has led to much apprehension about management. The appropriateness of testing and further steps for management of sensitization in the absence of history of clinical reactivity should be discussed with parents.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^113P97hr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and retesting intervals for food allergy — Evaluate children with food allergies at regular intervals (1–2 years), and if food allergy is unlikely to change over time, as in adults, periodic re-evaluation (2–5 years) is recommended, depending on the food allergy [Strength of recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. Testing every 12 to 18 months is recommended in the first 5 years of life to assess for evidence of tolerance development, and this testing interval can be extended to every 2 to 3 years thereafter if levels remain high; for allergies to tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish, testing can be performed less frequently (every 2–4 years). If a patient has had a recent food-induced allergic reaction, there is little reason to retest during the 1- to 2-year time interval after the reaction; for a younger child (eg, < 5 years of age), testing every 1 to 2 years for several years to determine the decrease in sIgE can assist in assessing for natural tolerance development. Yearly education is needed to reinforce early recognition and emergency treatment, use of an updated emergency action plan, and repeat training with the epinephrine autoinjector, if applicable.

### Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States: report of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored expert panel [^112aUCQM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Addendum guideline 1 — early introduction and pre-introduction evaluation states that the EP recommends that infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both have introduction of age-appropriate peanut-containing food as early as 4 to 6 months of age to reduce the risk of peanut allergy, and that other solid foods should be introduced before peanut-containing foods to show that the infant is developmentally ready. The EP recommends that evaluation with peanut-specific IgE (peanut sIgE) measurement, SPTs, or both be strongly considered before introduction of peanut to determine if peanut should be introduced and, if so, the preferred method of introduction, and to minimize a delay in peanut introduction for children who may test negative, testing for peanut sIgE may be the preferred initial approach in certain health care settings in which skin prick testing is not routine.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^11791UMA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

LOW-RISK DRUG ALLERGY LABELS

Immune-mediated reactions to drugs most commonly manifest with cutaneous symptoms, although any organ can be affected. These skin manifestations are frequently benign and self-resolving generalized maculopapular exanthems or morbilliform drug eruptions. For delayed onset drug hypersensitivity reactions, early studies suggested a prevalence of 2% for cutaneous drug eruptions, with up to 90% of these being mild. Drug-induced urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis have been described as immediate drug hypersensitivity mediated by IgE or non-IgE mechanisms. However, even confirmed true IgE-mediated reactions could be transient and lost over time, as described for penicillin and cephalosporin allergies. In the pediatric population, there is an increased prevalence of viral-induced reactions compared with true drug hypersensitivity. In this context, when children develop a morbilliform drug eruption or serum sickness — like reaction, this is uncommonly positive on rechallenge and assumed to have occurred as part of a viral infection or viral drug interaction. When the drug allergy is not verified in childhood, this label can be carried to the adult age.

The drug allergy history is a key aspect of a drug allergy evaluation. This allows the clinician to differentiate between a side effect and an immune-mediated reaction. Patient-reported allergy history, in conjunction with health record review, has facilitated clinical risk stratification and guided allergy diagnostic procedures and recommendations across clinical care settings for decades. – More recently, the drug allergy history has been used to distinguish which patients may not need comprehensive allergy diagnostic testing. For example, in the context of penicillin allergy, clinical interviews, in the absence of skin testing, can assist in identifying very low-risk allergy phenotypes. Skin testing includes skin prick and intradermal testing (IDT), usually performed by allergists/immunologists or those with specialized training. Like any test with a low pretest probability, skin testing can lead to false positive results, which should be avoided in a low-risk population. A drug ingestion challenge remains the gold standard test to ensure that a patient can be successfully "delabeled". Various health care professionals can safely perform low-risk drug challenges with consensus-driven or empirically derived low-risk definitions and adequate training and resources. When an allergy entry is removed, deleted, or inactivated from the EHR, it is termed delabeling.

### NIAID-sponsored 2010 guidelines for managing food allergy: applications in the pediatric population [^111BHxxL]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Data from many studies have suggested a rise in the prevalence of food allergies during the past 10 to 20 years. Currently, no curative treatments for food allergy exist, and there are no effective means of preventing the disease. Management of food allergy involves strict avoidance of the allergen in the patient's diet and treatment of symptoms as they arise. Because diagnosis and management of the disease can vary between clinical practice settings, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) sponsored development of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. The guidelines establish consensus and consistency in definitions, diagnostic criteria, and management practices. They also provide concise recommendations on how to diagnose and manage food allergy and treat acute food allergy reactions. The original guidelines encompass practices relevant to patients of all ages, but food allergy presents unique and specific concerns for infants, children, and teenagers. To focus on those concerns, we describe here the guidelines most pertinent to the pediatric population.

### Pediatric allergic contact dermatitis: lessons for better care [^111ZQnGE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an immune-mediated condition that is likely underrecognized in children. ACD is the result of primary sensitization and secondary elicitation by allergy-provoking haptens. A detailed clinical history and physical examination may yield diagnosis. Patch testing is the criterion standard diagnostic tool for confirming the diagnosis of ACD in both children and adults. Herein, we present an overview of pediatric ACD, an analysis of relevant current literature on the topic, focused management recommendations, and a discussion of existing knowledge gaps that must be addressed by future research.

### Rational approach to allergy testing [^1147AT2D]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Allergy testing is commonly used when symptoms of allergic rhinitis are refractory to symptoms and there is potential for treatment with institution of avoidance measures or immunotherapy. Once the decision for testing has been made, the method of testing by either in vivo skin testing by prick/puncture or intradermal testing or in vitro testing of serum-specific IgE is dictated by factors in the clinical history and an informed decision by the patient. Because there is no perfect testing method, understanding the benefits and limitations of each method is important in selecting the best testing option for each patient.

Allergens — introduction and general considerations — several expert committees "compiled and selected 36 key allergens in North America", and for individual patients the choice of allergens for testing "should be guided primarily by the patient's history and physical examination" and the physician's experience; indiscriminate testing "is an unwise use of health care resources". Because North America is diverse, "it is not possible to devise a universal list" for all patients, and the range of extracts stocked "should reflect" local aerobiologic data and "knowledge of cross-reactivity patterns between allergens".

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112NtYFx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen hypersensitivity — prevalence, diagnostic testing, and management are summarized as follows: hypersensitivity reactions are "exceedingly rare"; in a clinic review over a 4-year period, 84 patients were identified and 13 were considered to have an allergy based on history and oral challenge testing. The validity of skin testing is unknown; currently the only intravenous formulation is 10 mg/mL, with a reported protocol using 10 mg/mL for skin prick testing and 1 mg/mL as well as undiluted 10 mg/mL for intradermal testing. Other reviews used skin prick tests up to 200 mg/mL despite evidence that concentrations more than 10 mg/mL can be irritants leading to false positives. For confirmation, the current recommendations for definitive evidence of a reaction are oral-based challenge tests, and a meta-analysis including 259 patients estimates the prevalence of true acetaminophen hypersensitivity to be 10.1% in adults and 10.2% in pediatric patients.

### Atopic dermatitis and food allergy: best practices and knowledge gaps – A work group report from the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee and leadership institute project [^116Xpoih]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis — food allergy testing and early peanut introduction guidance: "For children less than 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe eczema, the EP recommended that clinicians consider evaluation for milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy sensitization", when "the child has persistent AD in spite of optimized management and topical therapy" or "the child has a reliable history of an immediate reaction after ingestion of a specific food". "No specific recommendation was made for older children or adults". The guideline cautions that with skin prick tests (SPT) or specific IgE (sIgE), "the potential for false-positive results is high, particularly in patients with AD". For prevention, "For infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both, exposure to age-appropriate peanut-containing foods was recommended as early as 4 to 6 months of age (after appropriate evaluation.)", and a joint task force update "adopted similar language… for children with moderate-to-severe AD under the age of 5 years", while advising that "the clinician should only test for relevant allergens".

### EAACI food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: diagnosis and management of food allergy [^116ULwsY]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Food allergy can result in considerable morbidity, impact negatively on quality of life, and prove costly in terms of medical care. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology's (EAACI) Guidelines for Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Group, building on previous EAACI position papers on adverse reaction to foods and three recent systematic reviews on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of food allergy, and provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. While the primary audience is allergists, this document is relevant for all other healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, and pediatric and adult specialists, dieticians, pharmacists and paramedics. Our current understanding of the manifestations of food allergy, the role of diagnostic tests, and the effective management of patients of all ages with food allergy is presented. The acute management of non-life-threatening reactions is covered in these guidelines, but for guidance on the emergency management of anaphylaxis, readers are referred to the related EAACI Anaphylaxis Guidelines.

### Direct challenges for the evaluation of beta-lactam allergy: evidence and conditions for not performing skin testing [^114EGVpJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

In the western world, up to 10% of the general population and more than 15% of hospitalized patients report penicillin allergy. After a comprehensive evaluation, more than 95% of patients who report a penicillin allergy can subsequently tolerate this antibiotic. Traditionally, the most widely accepted protocol to evaluate beta-lactam (BL) allergy consisted of skin testing (ST) followed by a drug provocation test (DPT) in ST-negative patients. DPT is the gold standard for proving or excluding BL allergy and is considered the final and definitive step in the evaluation. Recently, studies have been published that support the use of direct DPTs without preceding ST for both pediatric and adult patients who report a low-risk historical reaction to BLs. However, these studies use various risk-stratification criteria to determine eligibility for a direct DPT. A standardized protocol for DPT is also lacking. In this review, we assess the current literature and evidence for performing direct DPT in the pediatric and adult populations. On the basis of this evidence, we also present risk-based algorithms for the evaluation of BL allergy in pediatric and adult populations based on a description of the historical reaction.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^1136cv2U]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) position statement — low-risk penicillin allergy delabeling — states that since the last AAAAI penicillin allergy position statement, direct oral challenge without preceding skin testing has been recommended as the preferred approach in low-risk pediatric patients and as a consideration in low-risk adult patients, and defines low risk patients as those with a remote history (> 5 years) of cutaneous-only reactions such as itching or morbilliform drug eruptions (MDE). Delabeling penicillin allergy is an important component of antibiotic stewardship and is endorsed by many professional organizations and public health bodies, and a penicillin allergy evaluation is not necessary for patients with a family history of penicillin allergy only or a side effect such as headache or nausea; these patients may simply be delabeled by history alone.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112iAu8T]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

This practice parameter update focuses on 7 areas in which there are new evidence and new recommendations. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been revised, and patterns of anaphylaxis are defined. Measurement of serum tryptase is important for diagnosis of anaphylaxis and to identify underlying mast cell disorders. In infants and toddlers, age-specific symptoms may differ from older children and adults, patient age is not correlated with reaction severity, and anaphylaxis is unlikely to be the initial reaction to an allergen on first exposure. Different community settings for anaphylaxis require specific measures for prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis. Optimal prescribing and use of epinephrine autoinjector devices require specific counseling and training of patients and caregivers, including when and how to administer the epinephrine autoinjector and whether and when to call 911. If epinephrine is used promptly, immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required if the patient experiences a prompt, complete, and durable response. For most medical indications, the risk of stopping or changing beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication may exceed the risk of more severe anaphylaxis if the medication is continued, especially in patients with insect sting anaphylaxis. Evaluation for mastocytosis, including a bone marrow biopsy, should be considered for adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis. After perioperative anaphylaxis, repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and based on the history and results of diagnostic evaluation with skin tests or in vitro tests when available, and supervised challenge when necessary.

### The importance of checking for delayed reactions in pediatric patch testing [^117HnUZk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patch testing is often performed with the final reading being completed at 72 hours. Studies in adults have shown that performing an additional reading several days later increases the yield of relevant positive reactions. We report a study of this matter in children. We conducted a prospective patch test study of 38 affected children aged 6 to 17 (mean 11.6 years), with presumed allergic contact dermatitis between April and July 2009. The patients were required to return at 48 hours for patch test removal and assessment of early reactions, at 72 to 96 hours (3–4 days) for evaluation of delayed reactions, and again at 168 to 216 hours (7–9 days) for a final late delayed reading. We tallied the number of patients with "equivocal" (+/?), +, ++, and +++ reactions and noted these as potential positive reactions by reading date. Twenty-five of the 38 children (66%) had a positive reaction at 48 hours; 32 children (84%) had a positive reaction at 72 hours (day 3); 19 children (50%) had a positive reaction at 168 to 216 hours (day 7–9). Of those 19, 16 (42%) had persistent reactions, while 5 children (13%) had new late delayed reactions. Among the new late delayed reactions, there were six allergens identified, four of which were considered of probable clinical relevance. When patch testing with Thin Layer Rapid-Use Epicutaneous test panels, a delayed reading beyond 72 hours may be needed to identify the offending agent(s) responsible for allergic contact dermatitis in some children. Additional studies are needed to assess optimal readings schedules.

### Conflicting predictions of whole egg versus egg component testing: a case report [^111v69ah]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there remains variability in practice with regard to using total egg versus egg component testing to determine risks of a reaction with ingestion challenge, it is important to recognize that IgE testing, including component testing, affects the probabilities of reaction and is not used to definitely diagnose allergy or to determine the severity of an allergic reaction. It is important to interpret results of allergy testing to families and explain the resulting probabilities rather than providing a dichotomous yes or no result, as well as to explain that immune responses to food include tolerogenic factors that change over time. For these reasons, indiscriminate food allergy panels should never be ordered owing to the very high rates of false-positive results that are found. False-negative results are also possible with these tests. Given these nuances, physicians who are not prepared to discuss probabilities of clinical outcomes should refer patients to an allergist to perform the testing and engage in a joint decision-making process, aligning a family's risk tolerance with the probability of a failed ingestion challenge. In addition to serum testing, allergists may incorporate skin testing and basophil activation tests to use in their joint decision-making process when ingestion challenges are considered.

Early introduction of allergenic foods is now recommended, particularly for children at higher risk for development of food allergies. This includes infants with eczema who are at risk for development of food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma as components of the "atopic march". Early introduction of allergenic foods can be difficult, as not all infants will consume the allergenic foods in quantities sufficient to prevent food allergies. For children with a history of atopy, early introduction of allergens is now the standard intervention for allergy prevention, with the current guidelines recommending a progressive introduction of solid foods, including allergenic solids, in the first year of life. While we await safer and more effective methods of curing food allergy, prevention remains the most important strategy.

### Managing possible antibiotic allergy in children [^112Wn7Bz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In children, allergic reactions to antibiotic are rare and several recent publications confirmed that they are clearly overdiagnosed, representing a major public health problem. Highlighting the most recent literature, the present review addresses the management of children with a possible antibiotic allergy.

Recent Findings

In diagnosis of antibiotic allergy, the patient's history is central although not sufficient. In case of suspicion of an allergy, the child should be referred to an allergist in order to perform a complete allergy workup, based on carefully selected diagnostic tests depending on whether an immediate or a nonimmediate reaction is suspected. The antigen challenge test remains the gold standard and has gained in importance, particularly in children presenting a benign rash while taking antibiotic treatment. However, this test potentially exposes individuals to a significant risk of severe reaction and has relevant cost and is time consuming. Several new diagnostic tools are currently under investigation and provide promising results.

Summary

Accurate diagnosis of antibiotic allergy is important not only to prevent serious or even life-threatening reactions, but also to avoid unnecessary drug restriction associated with increased resistance and health costs.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^113jtGZx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — follow-up and resolution rates in childhood food allergy state: Consider the natural course of allergies to specific foods when deciding on the frequency of food allergy follow-up evaluations, recognizing that milk, egg, wheat, and soy generally resolve more quickly in childhood than peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish; individualized follow-up can include roughly yearly re-evaluations in childhood with less frequent testing if results remain particularly high (eg, > 20–50 kU/L) [Strength of recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. Milk resolution rates were reported as approximately 80% by age 5 years in early studies, but a referral center suggested 19% at age 4 years, 64% at age 12 years, and 79% by age 16 years; wheat showed 29% by age 4 years and 65% by age 12 years, and soy 25% by age 4 years and 69% by age 10 years. Allergies to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish persist more often, but studies of children suggest about 20% become tolerant to peanut and 10% resolve tree nut allergy, and recurrence of a resolved peanut allergy is approximately 4%. For peanut, tree nut, fish, and shellfish, periodic re-evaluation initially by laboratory testing can be considered approximately yearly for young children with favorable test results and every few years or longer for older children and adults, with more frequent testing if values are becoming more favorable for tolerance.

### Assessment of pediatrician awareness and implementation of the addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States [^114V7G5D]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

When asked what they would recommend for infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy, 20.8% of pediatricians reported offering advice that was inconsistent with the guidelines, including 8.7% of pediatricians who would recommend peanut introduction without referring a patient to an allergist or performing an sIgE test or skin prick testing. Risk assessment of infants for peanut allergy is recommended only in the US, whereas other countries recommend early introduction of peanut for all infants regardless of risk. Although, in general, infants exhibit mild symptoms of the skin and gastrointestinal system and fewer respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms compared with older children, the overall evidence is limited. Furthermore, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases expert panel that published the guidelines chose a more conservative approach to avoid jeopardizing the transition to introduction of peanut-containing food, which has the potential to substantially decrease the prevalence of peanut allergy.

4 Discussion

4.1 Summary

Through this exercise, a multi‐disciplinary panel of clinicians with expertise in pediatric AD/FA reached agreement on how to interpret SPTs to four foods in the context of immediate, delayed or no FA symptoms in a child less than 2 years of age, with AD. It is not an endorsement of the use of SPT in all cases of infantile AD, but rather an effort to clarify how to interpret results when such testing is done, including inappropriately.

Consensus was reached for the use of commercial extracts for wheat and soy but not which specific extracts to use for milk or egg SPT. There was also agreement on wheal sizes for definite negative and sensitized SPT results, but not in the 2–4 mm equivocal range. Finally, there was consensus on appropriate end points for combinations of symptoms and SPT results.

The resulting flowchart (Figure 1) can be used by clinicians to aid in the diagnosis and management of SPT results for FA in children with AD.

### The 'MOAHLFA (P) index': an attempt to standardise a widely used array of descriptors of patch-tested patients [^115kmR1c]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thus, focusing further on AD, two issues arise in the definition:
Should only previous AD be considered, including during childhood, which may have disappeared for a long time, or also a current (additional) diagnosis of AD, in an adult consulting with suspected contact allergy? As the 'A' criterion should capture the physiological (epidermal barrier), immunological (TH2 skewing), and some exposure‐related impact of AD, it is suggested to consider both, current and previous, AD. If feasible and important to the particular research topic of an analysis, current and previous AD could be stratified for.
Which definition of AD should then be used? Regarding the physician's diagnosis of current or previous AD, some cases of AD may be easy to diagnose at first sight — possibly more in a general clinic than in a patch test clinic where the more complex cases may be seen. Trying to support a more standardised diagnosis, Hanifin suggested a set of essential, major and minor criteria, later condensed to the well‐known and widely used major and minor criteria. A slightly different approach of weighting different criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD was followed by Svensson et al. and Diepgen et al. arriving at a score making 'atopy' or 'atopic skin diathesis' a likely, possible, or unlikely diagnosis. Focussed on paediatric assessment, the UK working party elaborated, and validated, a set of widely used criteria for AD. The 'UK working party' criteria are also employed for adults, with; however, hitherto lacking validation of diagnostic properties (e.g. compared with the above‐mentioned criteria). A significant problem among adults is recall bias regarding previous AD. A slightly modified version of the 'UK working party' criteria was used in the Danish 'Health2006' study, namely, an itchy skin condition as a major criterion, plus a minimum of four minor criteria (i) history of involvement of the skin creases, (ii) a history of asthma or hay fever, (iii) a history of generally dry skin and (iv) onset before age 2 years. Moreover, previous AD has been operationally defined as an affirmative answer to the question 'Have you ever had an itchy skin condition that occurred on and off for at least 6 months and sometimes was localised in the skin folds?'. These examples used in (clinical) epidemiology, certainly not exhaustive, illustrate that a great abundance of such definitions exists. Future efforts toward standardisation should arrive at an AD definition that is both feasible and generally accepted in a clinical (patch testing) setting. For the time being, the definition as used locally, or the definitions, possibly varying, in multicentre studies, should be mentioned and referenced, respectively.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^116vPsSJ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

No prior studies have assessed the quality and reporting of diagnostic testing guidelines for childhood asthma. One study evaluated diagnostic guidelines in an adult primary care setting. Of interest, the authors found that recommendations based on high-quality evidence had greater rates of clinician adherence to CPGs. Two reviews specifically compared childhood asthma recommendations across international guidelines, focusing on management. For diagnostic questions, Level 1 evidence comprises prospective studies where diagnostic tests are compared with a gold standard test in all patients in the study group. Conducting such research in asthma is challenging due to the absence of a gold-standard test; it is even more difficult to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a sequential testing strategy.

Our study sought to determine: (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric asthma guidelines for primary care and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations for childhood asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114SnmZn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends SCIT as an adjunctive treatment for individuals who have demonstrated allergic sensitization and evidence of worsening asthma symptoms after exposure to the relevant antigen or antigens either acutely (eg, allergy to pets) or on a seasonal basis (eg, allergy to grass or ragweed) or a chronic basis (eg, allergy to dust mites). Individuals who place a high value on possible small improvements in quality of life, symptom control, and a reduction in long-term and/or quick-relief medication use and a lower value on the risk of systemic reactions of wide-ranging severity might consider SCIT as adjunct therapy.

For individuals with allergic asthma, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions to implement SCIT:
Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children (at a developmental stage at which allergic sensitization can be demonstrated) with allergic asthma, a history compatible with a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, and testing (as described previously) that confirms this sensitization.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy and the treating clinician considers allergen exposure to be a significant contributor to this lack of asthma control. However, clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when these individuals and/or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden.
In addition to assessing whether an individual with allergic asthma has an appropriate history before considering SCIT, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. This evaluation needs to be performed by a trained health care professional skilled in proper testing and result interpretation. The need for these types of specialty evaluations, as with the need for many diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions, may limit access to care, depending on local availability of these tests and the patient's health insurance coverage of testing.
Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma. Furthermore, clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. These individuals should achieve optimal asthma control before beginning SCIT to minimize the harms (systemic reactions) associated with SCIT, which tend to intensify as baseline asthma severity increases.
The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype. A positive test result may not be associated with asthma control over time but might, instead, reflect sensitivity in a different organ (eg, the nose in allergic rhinitis).
Allergen exposure could be the only triggering mechanism for allergic asthma symptoms, or it could be just one triggering factor for an individual, and another factor or factors (eg, respiratory tract infections, irritant exposure, or exercise) might also play a role in triggering allergic asthma symptoms. Because of the heterogeneous nature of allergic asthma, determining the precise efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the allergic component of an individual's asthma can be difficult.
Clinicians should administer SCIT in their offices and provide direct supervision because of the risk of systemic reactions. Such reactions can include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported.
Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home.
Because clinicians should administer SCIT with direct supervision, personnel with appropriate training should prepare and administer injections for each individual's dosing schedule, from the build-up to the maintenance phase. Equipment and personnel should be available to treat serious anaphylactic reactions.
One of the potential benefits of SCIT is its immunomodulatory effects, which can reduce the allergic inflammatory response in various tissues. Thus, SCIT has the potential to be disease-modifying and to reduce the clinical expression or severity of asthma over time.
Before administering each SCIT injection, clinicians should assess individuals with asthma for worsened asthma symptoms that suggest recent loss of asthma control. Physicians should consider withholding SCIT injections temporarily in patients whose asthma symptoms have worsened until their asthma control is restored.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma who are considering SCIT that this treatment has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms and the severity of disease over time. Individuals need to come to their doctor's office for SCIT because of the associated risk of systemic reactions. Local and systemic reactions of SCIT include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported. Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home. Before initiating immunotherapy, clinicians must review with the individual who has asthma the travel arrangements and time needed to travel to and from the clinic as well as the requirement for at least a 30minute observational period after each injection. These requirements may complicate compliance. Missed appointments due to scheduling problems are a safety and an efficacy concern because they may increase the likelihood of local and systemic reactions. Missed appointments can also complicate the ability to reach a maintenance dosing regimen that maximizes therapeutic benefit. Delayed systemic reactions (those occurring more than 30 minutes after injection) occur in approximately 15% of individuals after injection. The Expert Panel recommends that individuals who have had previous clinically significant reactions to immunotherapy ideally should have injectable epinephrine and carry it on their person to and from the clinic on the day of their injection.

### Diagnosing allergic diseases in children. practical recommendations for consulting pathologists [^117UCPwz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In the environment of managed care, children with allergic diseases are increasingly likely to be evaluated by nonallergist physicians. While the presumptive diagnosis of an allergic disease can often be suspected on clinical grounds, signs and symptoms are not reliable for establishing a definitive diagnosis or for deciding on management options. This article discusses the use of immunoglobulin E antibody tests to classify children with allergic symptoms. The information is intended for pathologists who offer consultative laboratory services to nonallergist physicians.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^114onBbp]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

Guidelines aim to reflect the appropriate standards of clinical care. Our study demonstrated the variable quality of methodology and reporting across international guidelines for childhood asthma. Few guidelines employed rigorous methods to search for the best available evidence, considered barriers, and facilitators in implementing guideline recommendations, appropriately involved all relevant stakeholders (including parents or public representatives), or had all guideline contributors declare and appropriately address conflicts of interest. The quality of evidence supporting childhood asthma diagnostic recommendations was also generally poor. Quality did not vary based on age group, test type or if the recommendation was "for" or "against" performing the test.

There were discrepancies in guidelines' recommendations about whether to perform a test based on different interpretations of the supporting evidence. Even though guidelines agreed that spirometry should be utilised for diagnosing asthma in children older than 5 years, the recommended diagnostic test thresholds differed. This would lead to significant uncertainty around testing and diagnosing asthma in children and also unreliable disease prevalence estimates.

The poor quality of evidence supporting recommendations and inconsistencies in guideline recommendations for a given diagnostic test could translate to variation in testing in clinical practice. This could mean some children receive tests unnecessarily, and others do not get tested, missing out on the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Over and undertesting causes harm to the individual patient from failure to receive appropriate treatment and its associated costs. It also has systemic implications relating to equity and fair distribution of resources.

### Testing for allergy… [^116D4RQP]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, the reader should be able to: Many children in the United States are affected by atopic disease. It has been estimated that 4% to 6% of children have food allergies, 8% to 10% have asthma, and 15% to 25%have allergic rhinitis. Additionally, large numbers of children who suffer from allergic rhinitis have coexisting otitis media and sinusitis. Further, there is a widespread impression that the incidence of allergic diseases has increased in the past 15 to 20 years, most notably in industrialized countries. The purpose of allergy testing is to help identify potential allergen that are contributing to the allergic disease process. By identifying the allergen, the patient and his or her family can avoid exposures, and the clinician can manage the disease appropriately. Allergy testing can be performed for a variety of foods, aeroallergens, latex, venom, and some medications. Skin testing methods were described initially more than. Comments

### Allergy testing in childhood: using allergen-specific IgE tests… [^1159r6Ua]. publications.aap.org (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of triggers can induce common pediatric allergic diseases which include asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and anaphylaxis. Allergy testing serves to confirm an allergic trigger suspected on the basis of history. Tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E are performed by in vitro assays or skin tests. The tests are excellent for identifying a sensitized state in which allergen-specific IgE is present, and may identify triggers to be eliminated and help guide immunotherapy treatment. However, a positive test result does not always equate with clinical allergy. Newer enzymatic assays based on anti-IgE antibodies have supplanted the radioallergosorbent test. This clinical report focuses on allergen-specific IgE testing, emphasizing that the medical history and knowledge of disease characteristics are crucial for rational test selection and interpretation.

Introduction Allergic diseases often warrant identification of specific allergic triggers for treatment. Most allergic responses are mediated by immunoglobulin E antibodies specific for the trigger allergen, which can be detected with in vitro tests or skin testing. The skin prick test, typically used by allergy specialists, is another means of detecting sIgE antibodies. 11 A number of devices are available for introducing allergen into the surface of the skin with minimal discomfort; a resulting wheal-and-flare response can be measured in 10 to 20 minutes. Saline and histamine controls are placed for comparison.

Intradermal skin testing is performed in special circumstances when increased sensitivity is required. Test Selection and Interpretation Tests might be selected to identify triggers from a number of potential common allergens, for confirming a specific trigger when there is suspicion of one, or in less common circumstances, screening for atopy. A positive serum sIgE or skin test denotes a sensitized state. However, detection of sensitization to an allergen is not equivalent to a clinical diagnosis. In fact, many children with positive tests have no clinical illness when exposed to the allergen. A physician interested in screening for atopy might select a small panel of common triggers.

Another means to screen for atopy is to use a multiallergen test that contains several common allergens in one test. Availability and composition of these tests varies by manufacturer. A positive result will not identify IgE to a specific antigen but can, at less cost than performing many individual tests, identify a child whose symptoms may relate to exposure to a specific allergen and warrant further specific testing or referral. The multiallergen test had excellent predictive value for identifying atopic children compared with SPTs and an allergist's diagnosis. 14, 15. Issues Specific to Respiratory Allergy 1, 6, 11 The disorders that respiratory allergy comprises are allergic asthma and seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis.

### Allergies in children [^116HiEqs]. Wikipedia (2017). Low credibility.

Allergies in children, which have increased in incidence since about 1970, are overreactions of the immune system often caused by foreign substances or genetics that may present themselves in different ways. There are multiple forms of testing, prevention, management, and treatment available if an allergy is present in a child. In some cases, it is possible for children to outgrow their allergies. Children affected by allergies in the developed world:

- 1 in 13 have eczema
- 1 in 8 have allergic rhinitis
- 3–6% are affected by food allergy Children in the United States under 18 years of age:

- **Percent with any allergy**:

27. 2%
- **Percent with seasonal allergy**:

18. 9%
- **Percent with eczema**:

10. 8%
- **Percent with food allergy**:

5. 8%. Pathophysiology A child's allergy is an immune system reaction to a foreign substance, or allergen, that is considered harmless to most. According to Dr.

James Fernandez with the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, "Genetic and environmental factors work together to contribute to the development of allergies. " Upon contact with an allergen, a child's immune system produces antibodies which patrol the body for future encounters with the invader. During any future encounters, the antibodies release immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes, skin, or stomach lining. The development and symptoms of asthma can also be triggered by allergies; indoor allergens and indoor volatile organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, have been known to do so. Anthony Durmowicz, M. D., a pediatric pulmonary doctor at the FDA also says that, if a child has both allergies and asthma, "not controlling the allergies can make asthma worse".

Common drug allergens in children are:

- Amoxicillin
- Penicillin
- Other penicillin-based antibiotics The most common insect bite/sting allergens are:

- Bees
- Wasps
- Ants
- Mosquitoes
- Fleas
- **Ticks Common skin allergens and triggers include**:

- Latex
- Chemicals
- Formaldehyde
- Plants
- Heat & cold
- Excessive sweating
- Stress & anxiety
- Infections. Signs/Symptoms According to the Mayo Clinic, "Allergy symptoms, which depend on the substance involved, can affect your airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. " The severity of the following symptoms varies from child to child. The symptoms of indoor and outdoor allergies in children may include:

- Runny nose
- Itchy, watery eyes
- Sneezing
- Itchy nose or throat
- Nasal congestion Symptoms of indoor allergies can occur year-round but tend to be more troublesome during the winter months when children are inside more often.

However, outdoor allergies, or seasonal allergies, normally change with the season. Possible symptoms of a drug allergy include:

- Hives
- Itchy skin
- Rash
- Facial swelling
- Wheezing
- **Anaphylaxis Symptoms of a potential insect bite/sting allergy include**:

- A large area of swelling at the bite/sting site
- Itching or hives all over the body
- Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath
- Anaphylaxis Symptoms of allergic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, or eczema, include:

- Itching
- Redness
- Flaking. Diagnosis There are some different ways that can lead allergists to an official diagnosis of an allergy. These methods include:

- Family history of allergies
- A diary with potential triggers or foods the child eats and reactions to them
- Elimination diet
- Skin tests
- Blood test
- Provocative testing.

### Allergy testing and immunotherapy… [^113qNRp2]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

General pediatricians should be aware of currently available options for both allergy testing and treatment of allergic disease, including immunotherapy. These are areas that practitioners may have limited exposure to during pediatric training and beyond, thus there are misconceptions about the evaluation and management of various allergic conditions. After completing this article, readers should be able to: Atopic diseases in the pediatric population often become a source of major concern for both patients and their caretakers. These conditions are quite common in children, with 5. 6% having reported food allergies, 9% with hay fever, 11% with respiratory allergies, and 12% with skin allergies based on the 2012 National Health Interview Survey of US children. Allergies are generally chronic and can significantly affect the child's quality of life.

For example, food and venom allergies necessitate carrying an epinephrine autoinjector at all times and limiting exposure whenever possible. This can. Comments.

Allergy describes a condition involving the immune system that causes sneezing and itching, chronic rashes, wheezing, or even life-threatening allergic reactions. Whether these reactions are minor or serious, there are things you can do to prevent or control most allergic problems. The more you know about allergies, the more prepared you will be to help your child. Read on for more information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about allergy symptoms, causes, and treatments. Allergies happen when the part of the body that fights off illnesses overreacts to a usually harmless substance that is eaten, breathed in, injected, or touched. An allergy is not a disease but a description of a way that the immune system reacts. This allergic reaction can affect different parts of the body, resulting in diseases or conditions such as Children get allergies from coming into contact with allergens..
