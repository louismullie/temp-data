Medication for alcohol withdrawal

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications to manage alcohol withdrawal syndrome across settings and patient populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and risk stratification to choose the right setting and intensity of care. Then, I should verify the first-line class and agent selection with attention to comorbidities like hepatic disease and pregnancy. Next, I will review dosing strategies (symptom-triggered, fixed-dose, front-loading) and monitoring for safety. After that, I need to check alternatives and adjuncts when benzodiazepines are contraindicated or insufficient. Finally, I will ensure patient education, escalation criteria, and transition to long-term AUD treatment, with thiamine supplementation addressed too [^112YjTTW] [^113V64BP] [^115Fj7cS] [^112J3KgG] [^115AVypa] [^115HtvxH] [^116DAPm5] [^113E6nER].

> Let me first confirm how to stage severity and risk because that determines everything else; I should verify CIWA-Ar thresholds for mild, moderate, severe and remember that CIWA-Ar should not be used as a diagnostic tool by itself, especially in medically ill patients where symptoms can be nonspecific or communication is limited, and I also need to consider PAWSS to predict risk of severe withdrawal and guide level of care decisions, particularly with PAWSS ≥ 4 suggesting benefit from inpatient benzodiazepines and close monitoring [^1113W8sF] [^116swBj5] [^116Nfjy6] [^114nS3CZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about setting; I should confirm that moderate to severe AWS generally warrants inpatient management with continuous reassessment and capacity for symptom-triggered dosing, while carefully selected lower-risk patients with reliable support can be managed as outpatients with daily follow-up and clear escalation criteria, recognizing that symptom-triggered outpatient approaches require reliable patient or caregiver monitoring and adherence to protocols [^112YjTTW] [^113pRDwj] [^111tkSHR].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy because that is foundational; benzodiazepines remain the evidence-based first-line across severities for seizure prevention and delirium tremens mitigation, with Cochrane data showing large seizure risk reduction versus placebo and network meta-analyses confirming superiority over placebo for key outcomes, so I should default to benzodiazepines unless a clear contraindication or special circumstance exists [^112gSWZq] [^112J8fbU] [^113V64BP] [^1113W8sF] [^1141WQnm].

> Let me think about agent selection next; for most patients without significant hepatic impairment, longer-acting agents like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred for smoother coverage and less breakthrough, whereas in alcohol-associated liver disease, cirrhosis, or when LFTs are pending or unavailable, I should switch to shorter-acting, non–oxidatively metabolized options like lorazepam or oxazepam to reduce accumulation and encephalopathy risk, especially in older adults where oversedation risk is higher [^112MZbZg] [^113MV3iC] [^115Fj7cS] [^115VHUT8] [^1152gmix].

> Wait, I need to verify dosing strategies because they directly influence exposure and safety; in monitored settings with trained staff, symptom-triggered protocols are preferred and associated with shorter duration and lower total doses, but if frequent assessments are not feasible or the patient cannot reliably participate (e.g., delirium, intubation), fixed-dose tapers or supervised front-loading protocols are appropriate alternatives, with individualized titration based on signs, sedation level, and respiratory status [^112YjTTW] [^11281jKU] [^112VQ6QD] [^116a8ZfC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought alternatives should be reserved only for absolute benzodiazepine contraindications, but I should correct that; ASAM allows carbamazepine or gabapentin as monotherapy in select mild to moderate outpatient cases and as adjuncts when appropriate, though high-quality comparative data indicate anticonvulsants as a class do not outperform benzodiazepines and may require more rescue medication, so any departure from benzodiazepines should be deliberate and context-specific [^113pRDwj] [^1113W8sF] [^111JPiMC] [^116tR8BS].

> I should confirm management of severe AWS and delirium tremens; high-dose, rapidly titrated benzodiazepines using IV symptom-triggered or fixed front-loading protocols are recommended to achieve light somnolence and control autonomic hyperactivity, with parenteral dosing preferred immediately after a withdrawal seizure and careful ICU-level monitoring when using agents like phenobarbital, which may be used as monotherapy where benzodiazepines are contraindicated or as an adjunct by experienced clinicians [^112VQ6QD] [^113ebfuX] [^117Tfpnm] [^113V64BP].

> Let me consider refractory or benzodiazepine-resistant AWS; phenobarbital is reasonable in skilled hands with close monitoring, while dexmedetomidine can mitigate autonomic symptoms but does not treat the underlying withdrawal physiology and can mask severity, and in ICU settings, propofol or ketamine may be options for resistant cases, noting the limited and confounded evidence base and the need to prioritize airway and respiratory safety [^113V64BP] [^115Ktxis] [^116a8ZfC].

> I should double-check special populations; in hepatic impairment, dose-reduce and favor lorazepam or oxazepam, in pregnancy benzodiazepines and barbiturates remain preferred despite small teratogenic risks given the maternal–fetal dangers of untreated withdrawal, and in patients unable to take oral medications, switch to IV or IM formulations as indicated, always with enhanced monitoring for oversedation and respiratory depression [^115Fj7cS] [^112J3KgG] [^117HzQxS] [^1112UDBW].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety thresholds; employ serial CIWA-Ar in communicative patients, use sedation scales like RASS and vitals to titrate therapy, hold or reduce dosing when oversedation emerges, and escalate care if agitation persists despite adequate dosing, seizures occur, hallucinosis or delirium develops, or vitals destabilize, particularly in outpatient settings where transfer criteria must be explicit [^1112UDBW] [^115AVypa] [^113CoyUp].

> But wait, what if CIWA-Ar cannot be used reliably, such as in ICU patients or those unable to communicate; I should verify that in such cases symptom-triggered regimens may be unsafe, so fixed-dose or front-loading strategies guided by objective parameters and close bedside assessment are preferred to avoid misapplication of "CIWA protocols" to non-AWS delirium or mixed presentations [^111zJamm] [^114nS3CZ].

> I need to ensure patient and caregiver education is explicit; counsel on strict alcohol abstinence during treatment, avoidance of other CNS depressants including opioids, driving and machinery restrictions in the first days, instructions to self-titrate down if excessive drowsiness occurs, and clear signs for urgent care such as worsening tremor, confusion, hallucinations, or seizures, because these steps mitigate preventable harms and prompt timely escalation [^115HtvxH].

> Let me verify the transition plan because withdrawal care is only the opening move; taper benzodiazepines over about 5–7 days where fixed-dose is used to reduce rebound, administer thiamine to prevent Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, and link the patient to longitudinal AUD treatment with consideration of medications like naltrexone or acamprosate and behavioral supports, as this integrated approach reduces relapse and downstream morbidity [^11281jKU] [^116DAPm5] [^113E6nER] [^114Q4T9r].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations align with contemporary national guidelines and major reviews; ASAM endorses benzodiazepine-first strategies with symptom-triggered dosing where feasible, CRISM emphasizes inpatient benzodiazepines for PAWSS ≥ 4, and systematic reviews consistently show benzodiazepines outperform placebo and that anticonvulsants as a class do not surpass benzodiazepines, reinforcing the central role of benzodiazepines with tailored adjustments for setting and comorbidity [^112YjTTW] [^116Nfjy6] [^112gSWZq] [^111JPiMC].

Benzodiazepines are the **first-line therapy** for alcohol withdrawal [^113V64BP] [^112J8fbU], with **symptom-triggered dosing** preferred when monitoring is available [^112YjTTW] [^113E6nER]. Lorazepam is favored in **liver disease** due to its metabolism profile [^113MV3iC] [^1152gmix]. Phenobarbital is an **alternative or adjunct** in severe or benzodiazepine-resistant cases [^113V64BP] [^115Ktxis], and carbamazepine or gabapentin are options for mild-to-moderate withdrawal or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated [^1113W8sF] [^116tR8BS]. Monitor for oversedation and respiratory depression [^1112UDBW], and adjust dosing for hepatic impairment [^115Fj7cS].

---

## Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are the **cornerstone of AWS management** because they reduce withdrawal symptoms, prevent seizures, and lower the risk of delirium tremens (DTs) [^112J8fbU] [^1141WQnm]. They enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, thereby counteracting the hyperexcitable state induced by alcohol withdrawal [^115Ktxis].

- **First-line therapy**: Benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line therapy for moderate to severe AWS [^1113W8sF] (CIWA-Ar score ≥ 10).

- **Preferred agents**: Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam are commonly used. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred for their long half-lives, providing smoother withdrawal control [^112MZbZg]. Lorazepam is preferred in patients with hepatic impairment due to its minimal hepatic metabolism [^113MV3iC] [^115VHUT8].

- **Dosing strategies**: Symptom-triggered dosing is preferred in inpatient settings with continuous monitoring [^112YjTTW], as it reduces total benzodiazepine exposure and treatment duration [^113E6nER]. Fixed-dose regimens with gradual tapering are recommended when symptom-triggered dosing is not feasible [^114veEu7] [^11736ExN].

- **Monitoring**: Patients receiving benzodiazepines should be closely monitored for oversedation and respiratory depression [^1112UDBW] [^115HtvxH].

---

## Barbiturates

Barbiturates, particularly phenobarbital, are **effective alternatives or adjuncts** to benzodiazepines, especially in severe AWS or benzodiazepine-resistant cases [^115Ktxis]. Phenobarbital is recommended for severe AWS (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated or ineffective. In severe cases — particularly following withdrawal seizures — parenteral administration (IV preferred) is recommended [^117Tfpnm], with close monitoring due to the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression [^117Tfpnm] [^116a8ZfC].

---

## Anticonvulsants

Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and gabapentin are **effective alternatives or adjuncts**, particularly for mild to moderate AWS or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated [^1141WQnm].

- **Carbamazepine**: Effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms and preventing seizures, particularly in outpatient settings [^1113W8sF].

- **Gabapentin**: Effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms and preventing seizures, with a favorable safety profile.

- **Valproic acid**: Considered as an adjunct in specific populations (e.g. no liver disease or childbearing potential) [^1113W8sF] [^115UH3NC].

---

## Adjunctive medications

Adjunctive medications are used to **manage specific symptoms** or complications of AWS.

- **Antipsychotics**: Haloperidol or olanzapine may be used to manage severe agitation or hallucinations, but caution is advised due to the risk of lowering seizure threshold [^115xE3EE].

- **Alpha-2 agonists**: Clonidine or dexmedetomidine may be used to manage autonomic hyperactivity, particularly in ICU settings [^115UH3NC].

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol or atenolol may be used to manage autonomic symptoms such as tachycardia and hypertension [^115xE3EE].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In hepatic impairment, **lorazepam is preferred** due to minimal hepatic metabolism, and dose adjustments and careful monitoring are essential [^113MV3iC] [^1152gmix]. In pregnancy, benzodiazepines and barbiturates are preferred despite potential teratogenic risks, as untreated severe AWS poses significant risks to both mother and fetus [^112J3KgG]. For outpatient management, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are recommended for mild to moderate AWS, with close monitoring and frequent reassessment [^114E3L4E] [^113pRDwj].

### Clinical management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^117SVsCL]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

Up to half of individuals with a history of long-term, heavy alcohol consumption will experience the alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) when consumption is significantly decreased or stopped. In its most severe form, AWS can be life-threatening. Medically assisted withdrawal (MAW) often forms the first part of a treatment pathway. This clinical review discusses key elements of the clinical management of MAW, necessary adjustments for pregnancy and older adults, the likely outcome of an episode of MAW, factors that might prevent the completion of the MAW process, and ways of overcoming barriers to the ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder.

The review also discusses the use of benzodiazepines in MAW. Although there is clear evidence for their use, benzodiazepines have been associated with abuse liability, blunting of cognition, interactions with depressant drugs, craving, delirium, dementia, and disrupted sleep patterns. Because glutamatergic activation and glutamate receptor upregulation contribute to alcohol withdrawal, anti-glutamatergic strategies for MAW and other potential treatment innovations are also considered.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^111zs8ei]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

In most instances, cannabis withdrawal is not severe and does not have a high risk of severe adverse outcomes. Medical or psychiatric comorbidities increase the risk of severity and the requirement for additional management. Cannabis withdrawal severity can be evaluated by a clinical examination of the number and intensity of DSM‐5 or ICD‐11 cannabis withdrawal features and by administering standardized measures of cannabis withdrawal. Unlike symptoms of other substance use disorders (SUDs), DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 assess only the presence or absence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms rather than their severity. The most clinically relevant criterion is the degree of patient distress or impairment in functioning. This can be assessed both subjectively (e.g. anxiety, sleep quality) and objectively (e.g. weight loss, fever).

The two most widely used cannabis withdrawal scales are the 16‐item marijuana withdrawal checklist (MWC), a revised version of the original 22‐item scale, and the 19‐item cannabis withdrawal scale (CWS). Both the MWC and CWS were developed before DSM‐5. There is considerable overlap of features between DSM‐5, MWC, and CWS, but not complete concordance. An adaptation of the MWC, the 14‐item composite withdrawal scale (WDS), corresponds more closely with cannabis withdrawal symptoms described in the DSM‐5. By comparison with other substance withdrawal scales (e.g. alcohol withdrawal scale), there has been limited psychometric validation of the various cannabis withdrawal scales.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114cAwqv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In hospital settings, no universally accepted method exists for tailoring severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) treatments to individual patients or patient populations. Strategies vary by treating provider and/or inpatient context (e.g. emergency department vs. ICU) and patient characteristics (e.g. mechanically ventilated vs. not). Such heterogeneity highlights the need for clinical practice guidelines to improve both recognition and management of SAWS in acutely ill patients.

Previous efforts to guide best practices for SAWS, and updated guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine, do not offer specific recommendations for treatment of hospitalized patients with co-occurring medical diseases. Instead, a consultative, multidisciplinary approach is recommended for assistance in selecting medications and/or treatment protocols for alcohol withdrawal. Although such an approach can be helpful, it raises concerns for treatment delays and misapplication of therapies that may have adverse effects. Therefore, increased understanding of the unique needs of hospitalized patients with SAWS, together with successful implementation of evidence-based practices, requires additional research.

- **Research needs span the translational science spectrum**: Gaps in SAWS research span the translational spectrum — from use of animal models to approximate the complexities of human disease and support biomarker development to predictive and prognostic enrichment strategies, rigorous clinical trials to evaluate therapies, comparative-effectiveness research, and implementation studies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111tkSHR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend using symptom-triggered dosing in settings without extended on-site monitoring. This approach is applicable if patients or caregivers can reliably monitor signs and symptoms using a withdrawal severity scale and adhere to dosing guidance. Otherwise, it is advised to use front-loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the intensive care unit [^116a8ZfC]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the intensive care unit, as well as the literature on the optimal pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the critically ill.

Treatment of alcohol withdrawal in the intensive care unit mirrors that of the general acute care wards and detoxification centers. In addition to adequate supportive care, benzodiazepines administered in a symptom-triggered fashion, guided by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol scale, revised (CIWA-Ar), still seem to be the optimal strategy in the intensive care unit.

In cases of benzodiazepine resistance, numerous options are available, including high individual doses of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol. Intensivists should be familiar with the diagnosis and treatment strategies for alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the intensive care unit.

### The effectiveness and tolerability of anti-seizure medication in alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a systematic review, meta-analysis and GRADE of the evidence [^111JPiMC]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have been used historically as treatment options in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). In the past 10 years, there have been no large-scale meta-analyses comparing ASMs with placebo or the AWS treatment standard, benzodiazepines. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ASMs in AWS.

- **Methods**: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO from database inception to March 2020, involving adults aged > 18 years with AWS. We included 24 RCTs reporting on a total of 2,223 participants. Efficacy outcomes included the number of participants experiencing AWS-related seizures or delirium, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) score reduction, and rescue medication requirements. Tolerability outcomes included adverse event rate and dropout because of adverse events, alongside severe and life-threatening adverse event rates. Quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

- **Results**: There was no evidence of significant improvements in any efficacy outcomes when comparing ASMs with placebo or benzodiazepines. When compared with benzodiazepines, ASMs demonstrated significantly increased odds of requiring rescue medications (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.32, 9.28; P = 0.012). When comparing ASMs with placebo, there were significantly more dropouts because of adverse events (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.05, 3.28; P = 0.034). Most results were of very low quality.

### Canadian guideline for the clinical management of high-risk drinking and alcohol use disorder [^116Nfjy6]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, CRISM 2023 guidelines recommend administering short-term benzodiazepines, ideally in an inpatient setting (withdrawal management facility or hospital), in patients at high risk of severe complications of withdrawal (PAWSS ≥ 4). Consider offering benzodiazepines in an outpatient setting where barriers to inpatient admission exist, provided close monitoring can be obtained.

### The alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^1167NqUg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common management problem in hospital practice for neurologists, psychiatrists, and general physicians alike. Although some patients have mild symptoms and may even be managed in the outpatient setting, others have more severe symptoms or a history of adverse outcomes that require close inpatient supervision and benzodiazepine therapy. Many patients with AWS have multiple management issues, such as withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, seizures, depression, polysubstance abuse, electrolyte disturbances, and liver disease, which requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach. Although AWS may be complex, careful evaluation and available treatments should ensure safe detoxification for most patients.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11134BoJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is common among hospitalized patients and can be fatal without appropriate pharmacologic management. Nevertheless, high-quality evidence to guide treatment decisions for inpatient AWS is lacking. Studies examining treatments for inpatient AWS are limited by small sample sizes and often exclude patients with serious medical and/or surgical comorbidities, although such conditions frequently coexist with AWS in acute care and especially critical care settings.

AWS is a continuum of neurophysiologic signs and symptoms, influenced by the severity of underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other medical conditions that can alter brain signaling pathways. AWS has been associated with increased ICU and hospital lengths of stay, hospital-acquired infections, the risk of sepsis, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Syndrome lacking clear definitions**: Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) is regularly encountered and managed by ICU providers but has been inconsistently defined. Most clinicians and researchers agree that SAWS is a progressive manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that often requires admission to intensive care settings for close monitoring and frequent administration of medications to address hyperautonomia (including but not limited to pyrexia, tachycardia, and/or hypertension), agitation, and/or delirium. These clinical features represent the hallmarks of SAWS, also called alcohol withdrawal delirium, delirium tremens, and "DTs" in the literature.

### Efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms: A randomized clinical trial [^115GEvD5]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Although an estimated 30 million people meet criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), few receive appropriate pharmacotherapy. A more personalized, symptom-specific approach might improve efficacy and acceptance.

- **Objective**: To examine whether gabapentin would be useful in the treatment of AUD, especially in those with the most alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted between November 2014 and June 2018. It evaluated gabapentin vs. placebo in community-recruited participants screened and treated in an academic outpatient setting over a 16-week treatment period. A total of 145 treatment-seeking individuals met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for AUD and were not receiving other AUD interventions. Of these, 96 who also met recent alcohol withdrawal criteria were randomized to treatment after 3 abstinent days. Daily drinking was recorded, and the percentage of disialo carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in the blood, a heavy drinking marker, was collected at baseline and monthly during treatment.

- **Interventions**: Gabapentin up to 1200 mg/d, orally, vs. placebo, alongside 9 medical management visits, each lasting 20 minutes.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The percentage of individuals with no heavy drinking days and those with total abstinence were compared between treatment groups and further evaluated based on pre-study alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

- **Results**: Of the 96 randomized individuals, 90 were evaluable, with 44 in the gabapentin arm and 46 in the placebo arm.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112VQ6QD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning the management of withdrawal delirium, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend using an established dosing protocol as a guide when treating alcohol withdrawal delirium. However, it is important to individualize dosing regimens based on the patient's signs and symptoms.

- **Medical management strategies**: Administer IV symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading in patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium. Consider switching to oral symptom-triggered treatment once light somnolence is achieved and the patient is calm and cooperative, if they are initially receiving IV medication.

Given the high prevalence, morbidity, and costs associated with alcohol-related conditions in hospitalized patients, universal screening for alcohol use and assessment of risk for the development of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) should be standard practices. Unfortunately, few studies have prospectively evaluated risk factors for SAWS in hospitalized patients. Existing data from small retrospective studies, most lacking validation cohorts, suggest that alcohol use disorder (AUD), a history of prior withdrawal, and heavy alcohol consumption before an alcohol-related hospitalization are strong risk factors for the development of SAWS.

The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA)–Revised (CIWA-Ar) is the most commonly used scale for grading the severity of alcohol withdrawal. However, CIWA-Ar scores are heavily weighted by subjective patient-reported data that are often unreliable in acutely and critically ill patients.

Electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes and direct alcohol biomarkers may be useful for proactively and objectively identifying hospitalized patients with unhealthy alcohol consumption who are at risk for SAWS.

- **Recommendation 1**: Readily available EHR data should be used to create computable phenotypes and an operational definition of SAWS. This committee proposes an operational definition supported by prior literature that has face validity but requires further evaluation in health systems with EHRs.

- **Recommendation 2**: Available and objective tools should be evaluated to risk stratify hospitalized patients for the likelihood of SAWS.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapies for alcohol withdrawal: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1141WQnm]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

There have been few head-to-head clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for alcohol withdrawal (AW). We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the comparative performance of pharmacotherapies for AW.

- **Methods**: Six databases were searched for randomized clinical trials through November 2021. Trials were included following a blinded review by two independent reviewers. Outcomes included incident seizures, delirium tremens, AW severity scores, adverse events, dropouts, dropouts from adverse events, length of hospital stay, use of additional medications, total benzodiazepine requirements, and death. Effect sizes were pooled using frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis models to generate summary ORs and Cohen's d standardized mean differences (SMDs).

- **Results**: Across the 149 trials, there were 10,692 participants (76% male, median 43.5 years old). AW severity spanned mild (n = 32), moderate (n = 51), and severe (n = 66). Fixed-schedule chlormethiazole (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.65), fixed-schedule diazepam (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.59), fixed-schedule lorazepam (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08–0.45), fixed-schedule chlordiazepoxide (OR = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.53), and divalproex (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05–0.86) were superior to placebo at reducing incident AW seizures. However, only fixed-schedule diazepam (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05–0.76) reduced incident delirium tremens. Oxcarbazepine (d = -3.69; 95% CI, -6.21 to -1.17), carbamazepine (d = -2.76; 95% CI, -4.13 to -1.40), fixed-schedule oxazepam (d = -2.55; 95% CI, -4.26 to -0.83), and γ-hydroxybutyrate (d = -1.80; 95% CI, -3.35 to -0.26) improved outcomes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115AVypa]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning monitoring in outpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend transferring patients managed in an outpatient setting to a more intensive level of care if any of the following conditions are present:

- **Agitation or severe tremor**: When these symptoms have not resolved despite the patient receiving multiple doses of medication, and there is no continuous monitoring (e.g. if the treatment setting is closing).

- **More severe signs or symptoms**: This includes persistent vomiting, marked agitation, hallucinations, confusion, or seizure.

- **Worsened existing medical or psychiatric condition**.

- **Oversedation**: If the patient appears oversedated.

- **Return to alcohol use**: If the patient returns to alcohol use.

- **Syncope or unstable vital signs**: This includes low/high blood pressure or low/high heart rate.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Outpatient management [^113E6nER]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death.

- **Screening tools**: The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale.

- **Treatment approaches**: Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies.

Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate further management strategies as necessary.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^1157Twre]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, no medications have been shown to be effective in managing cannabis withdrawal in randomized controlled trials. However, short-term symptomatic medications have been utilized for managing non-specific general cannabis withdrawal syndrome features and specific withdrawal symptoms such as sleep disturbances, nausea, anxiety, and appetite stimulation to enhance patient comfort and retention during withdrawal.

A comprehensive medical, medication, and substance use history should inform the use and dosing of these medications. As with all prescribing, it is crucial to balance the potential side effects against the unknown efficacy of these medications in this population.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1134qwxL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In regards to medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy for patients with severe, but not complicated, alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in the management of alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are advised as the first-line therapy.

- **Alternative options**: Administer phenobarbital for providers experienced with its use. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, consider phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116aPktZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in inpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering initiating pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone in patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications. Pharmacotherapy may include benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, providers are advised to administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for those experienced with its use). Additionally, consideration should be given to using carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115HtvxH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in the context of benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend educating patients taking benzodiazepines, as well as their caregivers, about the following:

- **Drug-drug interactions**: The danger of interactions between benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, leading to impairment and respiratory depression.

- **Combination risks**: The risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines, and the importance of abstaining from alcohol.

- **Activity precautions**: The risks associated with driving or using heavy machinery during the first few days of benzodiazepine administration.

- **Dose adjustment**: Instructions to reduce the benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs.

### A simplified protocol for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal [^112nExuU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate a novel simplified tool for symptom-triggered treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study involved inpatients in a county hospital with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) or delirium tremens between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008. The study used the Highland Alcohol Withdrawal Protocol (HAWP), a simplified derivative of the Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to compare the severity of withdrawal to hospital length of stay, total dose of sedative given, and risk of complications.

- **Results**: The study identified 442 patients with a primary diagnosis of AWS or delirium tremens, and those with another primary medical diagnosis complicated by alcohol withdrawal. After adjusting for demographic variables, each one-point increase in the initial and maximum HAWP scores correlated with an increase in the hospital length of stay of 0.3 days [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.17 to 0.43 days] and 0.45 days (95% CI, 0.32–0.57 days), and a 15.8 mg (95% CI, 6.6–25.1 mg) and 19.8 mg (95% CI, 11.1–28.5 mg) increase in the total dose of lorazepam given, respectively. The complication rate of seizures, intubations, pneumonia, and death was 13.1%, 12.9%, 6.1%, and 0.9%, respectively; a composite endpoint of these outcomes also correlated with initial and maximum HAWP scores (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03%-1.14%).

- **Conclusions**: The HAWP is a simplified and novel approach for managing alcohol withdrawal that correlates initial and maximum scores with hospital outcomes, including length of stay and complications.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1171yMkc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Existing systematic reviews did not fully address the a priori research questions. Therefore, a broad literature search strategy was implemented to identify studies evaluating the pathophysiology, diagnostics, and therapeutics for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS). This literature search aimed to be a comprehensive review, providing structure for the committee's subsequent activities, rather than a systematic review.

A research librarian at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus conducted a detailed search for relevant articles published from January 1960 to March 2019 in MEDLINE (Ovid interface), using keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms developed with the committee. Articles were excluded if they were unavailable in English or if the full text was not accessible online, due to cost and time constraints. Ultimately, 251 records were retrieved. The committee co-chairs reviewed these publications and categorized them into four translational groups (T 0–T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4) based on content. These initial articles formed the foundation of SAWS literature for further development by the committee.

Subsequently, committee members identified 36 additional studies relevant to SAWS pathophysiology, rating scales, risk stratification, and health services in April 2019. Each committee member reviewed the references pertinent to their section and supplemented them with additional references where necessary.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^11281jKU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning the use of benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering a fixed-dose regimen with a gradual taper. This approach is advised when prescribing a shorter-acting benzodiazepine to reduce the risk of breakthrough and rebound signs and symptoms.

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^111dzsj5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2015, Issue 4.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2017: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included three RCTs with 141 randomised participants. We did not perform meta-analyses due to the different control interventions. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no significant difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113Jj2MR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

At the in-person meeting in May 2019, each of the four section leaders briefly provided a synopsis of the available literature regarding research questions assigned to their section/translational domain. The section leaders identified preliminary knowledge gaps, which were vetted and expanded on by the full committee through discussion and consensus. The four sections then convened separately in breakout sessions to further define and delineate urgent research priorities. Finally, the entire committee reconvened to present refined concepts of needed research for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS). The meeting was recorded, and the co-chairs and section leaders took notes, which were later used in document development.

One chairperson (T.L.S.) drafted an outline of the research statement and circulated the outline to section leaders, who were tasked with drafting their sections of the manuscript. Notes from the in-person meeting held in May 2019 were available as needed. The co-chairs drafted all additional content with input and editing by committee members. The full committee reviewed the final draft of the manuscript and provided iterative feedback and revisions. After additional review and revision by the co-chairs and approval of the manuscript by committee members, a final draft was submitted to the American Thoracic Society executive committee.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^111bPfNN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Addressing the glutamate imbalance in AWS involves the use of medications that target neurochemical imbalances and symptoms associated with the condition. The most common medications are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABA A receptor, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. These medications act at sites distinct from the GABA binding domain, enhancing the activity of GABA A to increase chloride influx, thus exerting an inhibitory effect on neurons. Consequently, treatment with diazepam indirectly attenuates glutamate-mediated neurotransmission, alters glutamate concentrations in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex, and effectively mitigates the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal-related seizures and delirium tremens.

Other medications that alter the hyperglutamatergic state in AWS include:

- **Topiramate**: an AMPA and kainite receptor antagonist, and GABA A receptor modulator.

- **Lamotrigine**: a pre-synaptic sodium channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release.

- **Memantine**: an activity-dependent NMDA receptor blocker.

All of these medications demonstrate varying efficacy.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^115xE3EE]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms ranges from minor symptoms, such as insomnia and tremulousness, to severe complications, such as withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Although history and physical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose alcohol withdrawal syndrome, other conditions may present with similar symptoms. Most patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal can be treated safely and effectively as outpatients. Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of medications cross-tolerant with alcohol. Benzodiazepines, the agents of choice, may be administered on a fixed or symptom-triggered schedule. Carbamazepine is an appropriate alternative to benzodiazepines in the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

- **Adjunctive medications**: Medications such as haloperidol, beta blockers, clonidine, and phenytoin may be used as adjuncts to benzodiazepines in the treatment of complications of withdrawal. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be followed by treatment for alcohol dependence.

### The emergency medicine management of severe alcohol withdrawal [^1164Cjie]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alcohol use is widespread, and withdrawal symptoms are common after decreased alcohol intake. Severe alcohol withdrawal may manifest with delirium tremens, and new therapies may assist in the management of this life-threatening condition.

- **Objective**: To provide an evidence-based review of the emergency medicine management of alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens.

- **Discussion**: The underlying pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is central nervous system hyperexcitation. Stages of withdrawal include initial withdrawal symptoms, hallucinations, seizures, and delirium tremens. Management focuses on early diagnosis, resuscitation, and providing medications with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity. Benzodiazepines with symptom-triggered therapy have been the predominant medication class utilized and should remain the first treatment option with rapid escalation of dosing. Treatment-resistant withdrawal warrants the use of phenobarbital or propofol, both demonstrating efficacy in management. Propofol can be used as an induction agent to decrease the effects of withdrawal. Dexmedetomidine does not address the underlying pathophysiology but may reduce the need for intubation. Ketamine requires further study. Overall, benzodiazepines remain the cornerstone of treatment. Outpatient management of patients with minimal symptoms is possible.

- **Conclusions**: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these conditions while evaluating for other diseases. Benzodiazepines are the predominant treatment option for managing this syndrome.

### Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal [^112gSWZq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a cluster of symptoms that occurs in alcohol-dependent people after cessation or reduction in alcohol use. This systematic review focuses on the evidence of benzodiazepines' use in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004), and EU-PSI PSI-Tri database with no language and publication restrictions. We also screened references of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness and safety of a benzodiazepine in comparison with a placebo, other pharmacological intervention, or another benzodiazepine were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Fifty-seven trials, with a total of 4,051 people, were included. Despite the considerable number of randomized controlled trials, there was a very large variety of outcomes and different rating scales, and relatively limited quantitative synthesis of data was feasible. Benzodiazepines offered a large benefit against alcohol withdrawal seizures compared to placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.69; p = 0.01). Benzodiazepines had similar success rates as other drugs (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12) or anticonvulsants in particular (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16).

### Managing selected chronic conditions in hospitalized patients [^116Ff9bR]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), more specifically with respect to the prevention of AWS in the hospital: AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend assessing all patients with alcohol use disorder for withdrawal symptoms at the time of hospital admission. Management should then be carried out using benzodiazepines or phenobarbital.

### Evaluation of the brief alcohol withdrawal scale protocol at an academic medical center [^117RNSZu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The standard of care for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is symptom-triggered dosing of benzodiazepines using a withdrawal scale. Abbreviated scales are desired for clinician efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the 5-item Brief Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (BAWS) protocol.

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study assessed patients ordered the BAWS protocol between August 1, 2016, and July 31, 2017. Data were collected on benzodiazepine exposure, duration of treatment, withdrawal severity, agitation, over-sedation, and delirium while being treated for alcohol withdrawal. Comparisons were made to analyze predetermined patient subgroups. Seven hundred ninety-nine patients were initiated on the BAWS protocol. Patients received a median (IQR) of 0 (0–4) lorazepam equivalents (LEs) and were on the BAWS protocol for a median (IQR) of 44.9 (22.4–77.2) hours. Of the patients that received benzodiazepines while on the BAWS protocol, a median (IQR) of 4 (2–11) LEs were given. Seventeen (2.1%) patients had severe withdrawal. Days of agitation, over-sedation, and delirium were minimal, with a median (IQR) of 0 (0–0). Few patients received adjunctive medications for symptom management. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients had more severe withdrawal than non-ICU patients, but received the same cumulative benzodiazepine dose.

Most patients on the BAWS protocol received little-to-no benzodiazepines; severe withdrawal, agitation, delirium, or over-sedation were uncommon. This is the first evaluation of this kind.

### Anticonvulsants for alcohol withdrawal [^1115kk6y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Alcohol abuse and dependence represent a serious health problem worldwide, with significant social, interpersonal, and legal implications. Besides benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants are often used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Anticonvulsant drugs are indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, either alone or in combination with benzodiazepine treatments. Despite their widespread use, the exact role of anticonvulsants in treating alcohol withdrawal has not yet been adequately assessed.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Register of Trials (December 2009), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (1966 to December 2009), and EconLIT (1969 to December 2009). Parallel searches on websites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases, were also conducted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness, safety, and overall risk-benefit of anticonvulsants in comparison with a placebo or other pharmacological treatments. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and outpatient or inpatient therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.

- **Main results**: Fifty-six studies, with a total of 4,076 participants, met the inclusion criteria. When comparing anticonvulsants with a placebo, no statistically significant differences were found for the six outcomes considered. Comparisons of anticonvulsants versus other drugs did not reach any conclusion regarding effectiveness.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114zBLS4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) is a highly morbid condition characterized by brain hyperexcitation that occurs among patients who discontinue heavy alcohol use. The definition of heavy alcohol use varies. Daily consumption in the range of four or more drinks for men, or three or more drinks for women, has been used to define heavy alcohol use, as well as binge drinking on 5 or more days per month. However, central nervous system alterations can occur at levels of alcohol consumption differing from these quantitative definitions, culminating in SAWS.

SAWS is commonly encountered by inpatient providers of various disciplines, but most patients with SAWS are managed in the ICU. Minimal evidence exists to guide inpatient management of SAWS, underscoring broad research questions that span the translational science spectrum. This research statement summarizes existing literature, identifies knowledge gaps, and offers recommendations for high-impact research related to SAWS in each domain of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) T0 –T4 research continuum. In this continuum, T0 –T1 includes basic science research with translation to humans, and T2, T3, and T4 include research with translation to improved patient care, clinical practice, and community health, respectively.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in the context of withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating immediate treatment with medication effective at preventing subsequent seizures. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy, preferably using a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam. Phenobarbital can be considered as another option, though it is less preferred than benzodiazepines.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111zJamm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Existing evidence does not generalize to hospitalized patients

Symptom-triggered dosing schedules, sometimes known as "CIWA protocols", are widely used to guide the administration of benzodiazepines in patients with presumed severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS); however, these strategies are not always appropriately applied and may pose risks to acutely ill hospitalized patients. For example, CIWA protocols can be implemented in hospitalized patients with symptoms mimicking alcohol withdrawal, such as other forms of delirium. Hospitalized patients are also inappropriate candidates for symptom-driven pharmacotherapy if unable to verbally communicate, including individuals who already have SAWS or another incapacitating illness or individuals who require intubation. Alternative strategies to CIWA protocols for treating SAWS include fixed-dose or front-loading benzodiazepines and/or other classes of medications such as antiepileptics and antisympathomimetics. However, the safety and effectiveness of these different approaches to managing alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized patients are poorly understood.

Benzodiazepines are considered the first-line therapy for alcohol withdrawal but must be approached with caution in acutely ill hospitalized patients, given dose-dependent associations with somnolence, respiratory depression, delirium, and mortality. Patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects from benzodiazepines, given an established relationship between chronic heavy alcohol use and delirium. Tolerance to benzodiazepines among patients with heavy alcohol use is also common.

### Successful symptom-based management of active withdrawal from multiple illicit benzodiazepines [^1119zQqu]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are among the most often misused medications. Medication tapering is required to prevent lethal withdrawal symptoms associated with abrupt cessation. The authors report a case of a male in his early 20s who presented following a seizure precipitated by the abrupt cessation of multiple illicit substances. Further history identified bromazolam, flubromazepam, alcohol, kratom, tianeptine, and phenibut as the predominant substances involved in his presentation.

The lack of approved long-acting benzodiazepine equivalents for bromazolam and flubromazolam, and kratom's inhibition of benzodiazepine metabolism, eliminated utilization of the conventional withdrawal management strategy. Symptom-based management was initiated using diazepam to stabilize the patient during active withdrawal. Tapering of withdrawal medications and initiation of medical management for co-existing psychiatric conditions followed stabilization.

Recommendations utilize equivalent benzodiazepine conversions and scheduled tapers. In the setting of unknown equivalents, physicians should prioritize symptomatic stabilization to prevent poor outcomes.

### Outpatient management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114Q4T9r]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 2% to 9% of patients seen in a family physician's office have alcohol dependence. These patients are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they abruptly abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome begins six to 24 hours after the last intake of alcohol. The signs and symptoms include tremors, agitation, nausea, sweating, vomiting, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium, and seizures. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and facilitate continued abstinence from alcohol.

Patients with mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated as outpatients. This approach minimizes expense and allows for less interruption of work and family life. Patients with severe symptoms or who are at high risk of complications should receive inpatient treatment. In addition to supportive therapy, benzodiazepines are recommended, either in a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered schedule. Medication should be given at the onset of symptoms and continued until symptoms subside.

Other medications, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, and gabapentin, have less abuse potential but do not prevent seizures. Typically, physicians should see these patients daily until symptoms subside. Although effective treatment is an initial step in recovery, long-term success depends on facilitating the patient's entry into ongoing treatment.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^11299Tou]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Pharmacological management of withdrawal symptoms and thiamine provision are cornerstones of effective prevention of alcohol-withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Avoidance of withdrawal symptoms through relapse prevention, referral to alcohol services, sobriety promotion, and thiamine provision remain the most holistic and impactful routes to reducing short- and long-term harms among those with alcohol use disorder (AUD).

In addition to the avenues already discussed, various innovative approaches, including outcomes from studies employing existing medications for cognitive decline, warrant discussion. Trials of traditional therapies for cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's, such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, show mixed results in alcohol-related cognitive impairments. A larger number of participants demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of memantine in AUD, with some also reporting a reduced number of heavy drinking days, units consumed, or craving. In addition, memantine has been shown to improve quality of life scales and various measures of cognitive function at 12 weeks in individuals with alcohol-related dementia. Finally, in a single case study, memantine improved cognitive functioning in an individual with alcohol-related cognitive impairment. Interestingly, during this trial, two relapses occurred: one where memantine was discontinued and restarted, and another where memantine was continued throughout. The former was associated with a relapse of cognitive impairment, whereas the latter was not, further highlighting the potential benefits of continuous memantine administration.

- **Establishing best practices to improve clinical outcomes (T 3 research)**: No multicenter RCTs have evaluated the impact of different treatments for SAWS on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. Commonly used treatment strategies are extrapolated from small studies of patients admitted to detoxification units without acute comorbidities or severe manifestations of alcohol withdrawal. In this section, the existing literature on clinical therapies for SAWS is examined, methodologic challenges of performing clinical trials in patients with SAWS are described, and recommendations for T 3 research are outlined with the goal of establishing evidence-based practices for management of SAWS in hospitalized patients.

- **Choice of medication for treatment of SAWS**: Insufficient data exist to guide the initial choice of medication for treatment of SAWS. Studies of patients with uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal suggest that multiple classes of medications, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates, may be reasonable first-line strategies. Extrapolation of data derived from patients enrolled in detoxification units provides insufficient guidance for treating hospitalized patients with more severe clinical signs and symptoms and/or active comorbid illnesses. Efficacy trials are therefore needed to clarify the preferred first-line therapy within different clinical phenotypes commonly represented among hospitalized patients with SAWS (e.g. differing illness trajectories and acute organ dysfunctions).

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115Ktxis]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Medications targeting the main pathophysiologic mechanisms of alcohol withdrawal, which are GABAergic and antiglutamatergic effects, include ethanol, ketamine, propofol, and phenobarbital. These nonbenzodiazepine medications could theoretically serve as monotherapy alternatives to benzodiazepines for the initial management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS).

Treatment using ethanol is controversial. Data comparing its use, whether enteral or intravenous, to benzodiazepines in early/mild withdrawal, have shown no clear differences in short-term clinical outcomes. The American Society of Addiction Medicine specifically recommends against the use of ethanol for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in any context.

There are few studies examining the use of ketamine for the management of SAWS. Existing data suggest an association between ketamine use and decreased intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.

Data regarding propofol therapy for SAWS are limited to retrospective cohort studies. One study suggested that propofol may be effective for SAWS when used as monotherapy. Multiple case reports describe successful use of propofol for the management of benzodiazepine-resistant SAWS. In other studies, however, when propofol was used as an adjuvant to benzodiazepines, the time to resolution of symptoms, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital and ICU length of stay were all increased in comparison with benzodiazepine monotherapy. Importantly, these findings may be confounded by the severity of illness in patients requiring such treatment.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113vAkLG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Amid impressive research collaborations and noteworthy advances in critical care medicine, certain conditions have received less attention than others. This inequality in the application of science to practice has not clearly tracked with disease prevalence, morbidity, or mortality. Addiction research and treatment is under-resourced compared with other medical conditions. Although the overarching reasons for these inequalities are likely multifactorial, in the case of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS), stigma and stereotypes pose challenges that have arguably blunted the standards of research and acceptable practices in this field.

At the same time that opioid use disorder and overdose have captured public attention and are garnering appropriate research support, treatment standards for the more common manifestations of alcohol use disorder (AUD), including alcohol withdrawal, remain underdeveloped. This report takes a step toward addressing this imbalance by identifying several investigative opportunities for improving the management of SAWS. However, subsequent steps will be the true catalysts for change. Scientists from various disciplines will need to direct their attention to the problem of SAWS, pool their energies and expertise, and convince funding agencies to support the research efforts described in this report.

Providers from various disciplines care for patients with SAWS, making it a broadly relevant problem, but this diversity may also contribute to a historical lack of ownership. Through this report, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and its critical care community assume responsibility for elevating the standards of care for patients with SAWS.

High-quality evidence-based treatments for hospitalized patients with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) do not yet exist; thus, no published data are available regarding how to best implement guideline-recommended care or monitor outcomes at the population level. Early consideration of implementation frameworks (e.g. Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) and outcomes will help minimize the gaps between efficacious therapies for SAWS and their effective delivery to patients.

- **Recommendation 1**: A wide array of stakeholders (e.g. patients, caregivers, advocacy groups, community members, interdisciplinary clinicians, purchasers, payers, administrators, policy makers, and researchers) should be engaged, and nontraditional partnerships (e.g. among critical care, medical toxicology, and addiction specialists) should be established before examining an innovation's effectiveness to accelerate the transfer of innovations into practice.

- **Recommendation 2**: Knowledge and infrastructure from existing critical care research networks should be harnessed to establish systems for real-time data collection and feedback spanning multiple hospitals. Through describing processes of patient care, feedback regarding performance, and interventions such as guideline distribution and progress updates, best practices can be refined and reinforced alongside clinical research activities for SAWS to homogenize care.

### Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal [^112J8fbU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Alcohol abuse and dependence represent a serious health problem worldwide with social, interpersonal, and legal implications. Benzodiazepines have been widely used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, it is unknown whether different benzodiazepines and different regimens of administration may have the same merits.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

- **Search strategy**: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Register of Trials (December 2009), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (January 1966 to December 2009), EconLIT (1969 to December 2009). Parallel searches were conducted on websites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials examining effectiveness, safety, and risk-benefit of benzodiazepines in comparison with placebo or other pharmacological treatments and between themselves. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and whether they received outpatient or inpatient therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.

- **Main results**: Sixty-four studies with 4,309 participants met the inclusion criteria. Comparing benzodiazepines versus placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, based on 3 studies with 324 participants, RR 0.16 (0.04 to 0.69), with no statistically significant difference for the other outcomes considered. Comparing benzodiazepines versus other drugs, there is a trend in favor of benzodiazepines for seizure and delirium control.

Antiepileptic medications as treatment for SAWS

Meta-analyses examining the effects of antiepileptics in aggregate (e.g. carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, valproic acid) for SAWS have reported no differences in clinical outcomes compared with benzodiazepines; however, given their various pharmacologic mechanisms, evaluating antiepileptics as a single class of medication may bias the findings of these analyses toward the null. Although not specifically examined for use in SAWS, valproic acid is used for the management of inpatient alcohol withdrawal at some centers based on extrapolation of data from detoxification units. Small studies suggest that the use of valproic acid during alcohol withdrawal is associated with improved symptom management compared with benzodiazepines; however, these data are limited by a lack of blinding and/or retrospective cohort designs. Other studies suggest that the use of valproic acid for alcohol withdrawal has effectiveness similar to that of phenobarbital and results in reduced symptom duration, lower incidence of ICU transfer, and fewer withdrawal seizures and side effects than the use of carbamazepine.

Additional pharmacologic mechanisms targeting SAWS

Medications that do not directly target GABA and/or glutamate signaling may attenuate certain signs and symptoms of SAWS (e.g. abnormal hemodynamics or behavioral aggression) that are used to gauge disease severity. As a result, these medications can mask SAWS while having unclear effects on brain hyperexcitation. One such medication is dexmedetomidine, which has been proposed as an adjunctive agent.

- **Benzodiazepine dosing strategies**: Benzodiazepine dosing strategies for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal include fixed-dose, symptom-triggered, and front-loading regimens. Fixed-dose regimens consist of a predetermined dose of a benzodiazepine administered at regular intervals and gradually tapered over a period of days. Symptom-triggered dosing employs a more reactive approach, with the dose and frequency of benzodiazepine administration tailored to the severity of withdrawal as determined by using an alcohol withdrawal clinical assessment tool (e.g. the CIWA-Ar). Front-loading regimens use a proactive, concentrated dosing strategy, including several escalating doses or continuous infusion of a benzodiazepine (often with adjunctive medications like phenobarbital) over a short period of time.

Fixed-dose and symptom-triggered regimens have been studied in patients with alcohol use disorder enrolled from detoxification units. In this specific setting, randomization to symptom-triggered therapy rather than to fixed-dose therapy resulted in shorter treatment duration and reduced cumulative exposure to benzodiazepines; however, prospective comparisons of benzodiazepine dosing strategies have not been examined in patients with acute or critical illness. In ICU settings, the majority of evidence guiding treatment derives from preimplementation–postimplementation studies of front-loading protocols for the management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. These studies suggest that front-loading strategies are associated with faster control of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, shorter ICU stays, and lower rates of intubation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting. This includes patients with a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and those within the window for symptom development during withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for monotherapy. Administering at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is another strategy. Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worsening withdrawal is unknown.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^114ULZDX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). High credibility.

To our knowledge, two randomized controlled trials have been performed since the 2013 Cochrane review, summarizing their findings. These studies demonstrate low pre-treatment serum magnesium concentrations within their population, in agreement with various reports. Magnesium supplementation had no impact on outcomes. In contrast, using a more intensive intravenous regimen, within British National Formulary dose recommendations, a positive effect on the duration of withdrawal symptoms and resolution of raised lactate, and post-treatment serum magnesium concentrations were observed.

Of note, these studies represent two distinct clinical populations: those presenting to acute medical services with marked alcohol-withdrawal symptoms requiring acute management, and those presenting to addiction units either in a scheduled manner or following a visit to the emergency ward. The impact of magnesium provision may be affected by the acuity of their symptoms and prior treatment with thiamine supplementation, for example.

Whilst there is limited evidence from controlled trials since the seminal 2013 Cochrane Report relating to magnesium supplementation in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), the impact that reduced serum magnesium concentrations may have on patient outcomes is clearer.

The pathophysiological role that magnesium plays in the management of AWS is an area that requires further exploration.

### Benzodiazepine loading versus symptom-triggered treatment of alcohol withdrawal: A prospective, randomized clinical trial [^11736ExN]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). High credibility.

The objectives were to compare the efficacy of a benzodiazepine loading versus a symptom-triggered protocol in the management of alcohol withdrawal.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial including 47 consecutive patients admitted to one of two tertiary care medical centers who developed alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned to either a benzodiazepine loading protocol or a symptom-triggered treatment protocol. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised scale (CIWA-Ar) was recorded throughout the length of stay, along with measures of autonomic system functioning.

- **Results**: The average rate of change of CIWA-Ar scores was -1.5 ± 1.3 for the symptom-triggered group and -2.3 ± 2.5 for the loading group. The average rate of change for systolic blood pressure was -2.7 ± 5.3 for the symptom-triggered group and -2.3 ± 6.4 for the loading group. There was no significant difference between the rates of change for either group on either measure. Similarly, there was no significant difference in total benzodiazepine use between groups. Within 72 hours of treatment, 69.6% of patients in the loading group were free of withdrawal symptoms versus 41.7% in the symptom-triggered group, a difference not reaching statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: This study did not reveal clear evidence of a clinical advantage for choosing either treatment method.

### Executive summary of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111UhY7w]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management provides guidance on the identification and management of alcohol withdrawal in adults with varying degrees of syndrome severity. The guideline addresses both ambulatory and inpatient care and considers special patient populations. It was primarily developed following the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), a process to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. This process included a review of gray and empirical literature published between January 2012 and October 2017. A total of nineteen existing guidelines, 112 reviews, and 150 research studies were used to develop draft guideline statements that were assessed by a panel of physicians experienced in withdrawal management and representing a diverse range of settings and patient populations. Recommendations were included in the guideline where consensus on appropriate clinical practice was identified by the panel. Areas where additional research would provide valuable information for determining best practices were highlighted.

### Pharmacological interventions for alcohol withdrawal syndrome among hospitalized adults: A multicenter cohort study [^115pqpCZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in 1 in 43 hospitalized patients and is associated with increased morbidity. Pharmacotherapy for patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal syndrome is incompletely described. Understanding practice patterns is essential to improving outcomes and addressing variability in care.

- **Objective**: To identify alcohol withdrawal syndrome treatment practice patterns across United States hospitals.

- **Design**: Multicenter retrospective cohort study with data collected between the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2022 using Premier Incorporated's Artificial Intelligence Healthcare Database (approximately 25% of United States hospital admissions; excludes emergency room care).

- **Participants**: A total of 245,271 adult inpatients with a primary diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

- **Main measures**: The outcomes were alcohol withdrawal syndrome medication treatment patterns, including initial treatment regimens, dosage trends, and factors associated with medication choices.

- **Key results**: Among 245,271 patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, 226,816 (92.5%) received benzodiazepines, 28,123 (11.5%) received phenobarbital, and 113,746 (46.4%) received other AWS agents within the first five days of admission. The most common initial treatment regimens were benzodiazepines alone (56.0%), benzodiazepines and other agents together (22.2%), and benzodiazepines and phenobarbital together (3.8%). Median daily benzodiazepine dose (diazepam equivalents) peaked on hospital day 2 (46.2 mg [interquartile range 23.1–84.2]), whereas the median daily phenobarbital dose peaked on hospital day…

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112J3KgG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), particularly in pregnant patients, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend administering benzodiazepines and barbiturates as the preferred medications for treatment. While there is a recognized risk of teratogenicity during the first trimester, these risks appear small and are balanced against the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the potential consequences to both mother and fetus if severe maternal alcohol withdrawal develops.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117Tfpnm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in the context of withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend preferring parenteral administration of medications following a withdrawal seizure. If available, intravenous (IV) administration is preferred over intramuscular (IM) administration, although IM administration is also effective. Use parenteral phenobarbital only in highly supervised settings, such as an ICU or critical care unit, due to the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression.
