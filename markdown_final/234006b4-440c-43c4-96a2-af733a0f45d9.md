## Question

what to do in a female that had a uti and took bactrim but still feeling symptomatic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when a woman still has UTI symptoms after taking Bactrim. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about syndrome characterization and red flags. Then, I should verify the initial treatment parameters and adherence. Next, I will assess resistance risk factors and community resistance thresholds. After that, I need to obtain diagnostic confirmation with culture and consider mimics. I will then select an appropriate alternative empiric regimen while awaiting culture, counsel on expected course and follow-up, evaluate special populations and complications, plan for persistent or recurrent failure, and conclude with prevention strategies and a concise decision pathway [^115fXgm6] [^116Fq6DA].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and severity; I need to ensure we are dealing with uncomplicated cystitis without systemic features, because the presence of fever, rigors, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, vomiting limiting oral intake, hypotension, or altered mental status pushes me toward urgent evaluation and possibly IV therapy rather than outpatient oral management, and I should not miss evolving pyelonephritis or sepsis [^112RrESb] [^115e9Bwk].

> Next, I should review the initial Bactrim course and adherence; I need to verify that the patient took trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days for uncomplicated cystitis, because that is the FDA-labeled regimen, and confirm doses were not missed, since steady-state is generally achieved after about 3 days and clinical improvement should typically begin within the first several days if the pathogen is susceptible [^115HAqZm] [^114KxHnU] [^116WfkPT].

> Wait, let me verify something about symptom timing; the initial thought might be that a longer pre-treatment symptom duration automatically predicts persistent symptoms regardless of therapy, but hold on, I should double-check that, because observational data suggest pre-consult duration did not independently predict post-consult symptom duration, whereas resistance status strongly influenced prolonged symptoms, so I should avoid overinterpreting early symptom duration and instead prioritize resistance assessment and clinical response [^112NZrMu] [^115yTeVp].

> I will now examine the risk of TMP-SMX resistance; I need to check for prior TMP-SMX use in the last 90 days, previous TMP-SMX–resistant isolates, genitourinary abnormalities, and whether the local E. coli TMP-SMX resistance rate exceeds 20%, because these factors increase the likelihood of resistance and argue against repeating TMP-SMX empirically after failure, especially when some communities report resistance around 25–44% and IDSA suggests avoiding TMP-SMX empirically when local resistance surpasses 20% [^114CVrxj] [^116DV2Di].

> Let me first confirm diagnostics after failure; culture with susceptibilities is mandatory now to identify the organism and guide therapy modification, and I should obtain a urinalysis to document ongoing pyuria or bacteriuria; at the same time, I need to consider vaginal infections, STIs, or urethral syndrome as mimics if the story is atypical, because misclassification can perpetuate antibiotic misuse and poor outcomes; FDA labeling also reminds me to select or modify therapy based on culture data whenever available [^116Fq6DA] [^111ag7A6].

> While awaiting culture, I should select an alternative empiric agent with low local resistance and appropriate spectrum; hold on, I should verify options with guidelines and local data: nitrofurantoin has very low outpatient E. coli resistance in contemporary cohorts and is guideline-preferred for uncomplicated cystitis, so nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days is reasonable if there are no concerns for early pyelonephritis or significant renal impairment; fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose is another first-line option with very low reported resistance; trimethoprim monotherapy can be considered only if susceptibility is likely and there was not a recent TMP-SMX failure; I should avoid repeating TMP-SMX now and avoid fluoroquinolones empirically given resistance pressures and stewardship priorities unless culture directs otherwise [^115fXgm6] [^116DV2Di] [^114M66v5] [^114UnsWW].

> I need to counsel on expected course and follow-up; with effective therapy, symptoms commonly begin to improve over 48–72 hours and moderate symptoms often resolve by around day 3–5, so I should arrange follow-up or clear return precautions if no improvement by 72 hours or if any systemic features emerge; I should advise adequate hydration and reiterate completing the full course, and I should warn about red flags such as rash or severe diarrhea in case of antibiotic-associated adverse events, including the crystalluria risk previously noted with TMP-SMX, even though we are now switching agents [^116WfkPT] [^115yTeVp] [^1136cCih] [^112saqk2].

> Let me consider special populations and complications; if the patient is pregnant, I should confirm gestational age and avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester when possible due to folate antagonism concerns, and select pregnancy-appropriate agents guided by culture; if renal impairment is present, I should ensure the chosen agent is appropriate and adjust as needed, recognizing that nitrofurantoin is generally avoided when renal function is significantly reduced; in pediatric or complex anatomic contexts such as high-grade vesicoureteral reflux or transplant, threshold for imaging and tailored therapy is lower, and oral therapy remains effective for many febrile UTIs absent severe illness signs [^114aep8A] [^115fXgm6] [^111tQQGw].

> If symptoms persist after this second, appropriate antibiotic course, I should double-check the culture for resistant or non–E. coli pathogens, repeat a culture to assess for persistence or new infection, and consider imaging to exclude stones, obstruction, abscess, or nephronia, escalating to ID consultation for multidrug-resistant organisms; I should also remember that discordant outcomes — clinical response with microbiologic persistence — portend late relapse risk, reinforcing why I should act upon the microbiological endpoint when it remains positive [^115e9Bwk] [^112RrFKf].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies if the patient has recurrent UTIs; I will emphasize behavioral measures and, for postmenopausal patients, consider vaginal estrogen; if recurrences meet thresholds, I can discuss antimicrobial prophylaxis options and, for selected patients, patient-initiated therapy while awaiting cultures, aligning choices with prior susceptibilities and stewardship goals after non-antibiotic measures are attempted [^114rAos1] [^112UM7hm] [^112kKQCz].

> In summary, the most likely cause of persistent symptoms after a correctly dosed and completed Bactrim course is TMP-SMX resistance given contemporary outpatient resistance rates, so I should obtain an immediate urine culture and switch empirically to nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin based on patient factors and local data, ensure close 48–72 hour follow-up, and escalate evaluation if red flags or lack of improvement occur, with definitive therapy refined to culture results thereafter [^114CVrxj] [^116DV2Di] [^115fXgm6] [^116Fq6DA].

When a female remains symptomatic after Bactrim for UTI, the priority is to **obtain a urine culture and susceptibility testing** to identify resistance or alternative pathogens [^114UnsWW]. If resistance is confirmed, **switch to an effective agent** such as nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or a fluoroquinolone based on local resistance patterns [^115fXgm6] [^116DV2Di] [^1161NYG2]. If the culture is negative, **evaluate for alternative diagnoses** [^115e9Bwk] (e.g. vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, urethritis) and consider imaging [^113KKVik] if symptoms persist or complications are suspected. Ensure adherence, adequate hydration [^112saqk2], and close follow-up to confirm symptom resolution and prevent complications [^116WfkPT].

---

## Step 1: confirm adherence and proper administration

Adherence — confirm the patient **completed the full Bactrim course** as prescribed [^116Fq6DA]; **Hydration** — ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and support urinary clearance [^112saqk2].

---

## Step 2: obtain urine culture and susceptibility testing

Culture — obtain a midstream clean-catch **urine culture with susceptibility testing** [^116Fq6DA] to identify resistance or alternative pathogens; **Resistance** — recognize that TMP-SMX resistance is common [^114CVrxj] and associated with clinical failure [^114UnsWW].

---

## Step 3: assess for complicated UTI or alternative diagnoses

Complicated UTI — evaluate for **pyelonephritis**, structural abnormalities, or **immunosuppression** [^115e9Bwk]; **Alternative diagnoses** — consider vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, urethritis, or sexually transmitted infections [^1156Fvm4].

---

## Step 4: adjust antibiotic therapy based on culture results

Resistance confirmed — switch to an **effective agent** [^115fXgm6] (e.g. **nitrofurantoin**, **fosfomycin**, **fluoroquinolone**) based on local resistance patterns [^116DV2Di]; **No resistance** — consider alternative diagnoses or incomplete adherence [^1156Fvm4].

---

## Step 5: provide symptomatic relief and patient education

Analgesia — use **phenazopyridine** for symptomatic relief [^1156Fvm4]; **Education** — emphasize adherence, hydration, and follow-up [^1136cCih].

---

## Step 6: follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up — reassess within **48–72 hours** [^116WfkPT] after therapy adjustment; **Persistent symptoms** — consider imaging (ultrasound or CT) [^113KKVik] to evaluate for complications.

Persistent symptoms after Bactrim for UTI require a **structured approach** that includes confirming adherence, obtaining culture, assessing for complications or alternative diagnoses, adjusting therapy based on results, providing symptomatic relief, and ensuring close follow-up [^1176LkpS].

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections usually begins before the results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. This approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTIs and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, including both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing.

Most notably, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the drug of choice for treating acute uncomplicated cystitis in women, is on the rise. Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis who are treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to the drug. Women with pyelonephritis also exhibit reduced bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for a resistant infection.

Therefore, in the outpatient setting, it is important to identify risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and understand the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community to choose an appropriate therapeutic agent. When selecting a treatment regimen, physicians should consider factors such as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and the selection of appropriate treatment options.

Regarding the medical management of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, particularly concerning the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy, depending on local antibiogram data, for symptomatic patients with rUTIs.

### Bactrim [^116Fq6DA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Bactrim should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

- **Urinary tract infections**: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

- **Acute otitis media**: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when, in the judgment of the physician, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offer some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. At the time of writing, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of Bactrim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Bactrim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

### Empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, in a geographical area with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens [^114UnsWW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to TMP-SMX-resistant (TMP-SMX-R) pathogens. Healthy nonpregnant premenopausal women with symptomatic lower UTI were assessed for the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria; if either was present, a urine sample was cultured and TMP-SMX was prescribed. Clinical and microbiologic cure was assessed at days 5–9 and 28–42 after the cessation of therapy.

For 71% of patients, cultures grew TMP-SMX-susceptible (TMP-SMX-S) microorganisms, and for 29%, cultures grew TMP-SMX-R organisms. Escherichia coli remained the predominant bacteria in both groups of cultures. At visit 2, microbiological cure had been achieved in 86% of the patients in the TMP-SMX-S group and 42% of those in the TMP-SMX-R group. Similar differences were found at visit 3 by clinical evaluation. Treatment with TMP-SMX of uncomplicated UTI caused by TMP-SMX-R microorganisms results in microbiologic and clinical failure. In high-resistance areas, TMP-SMX should not be the empiric drug of choice for uncomplicated UTI.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: Results from randomised controlled trial [^1176LkpS]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by enhancing the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

### Outpatient antibiogram and predictors of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant urinary tract infections [^116DV2Di]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Rising antibiotic resistance has transcended hospital boundaries and impacted individuals with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). Scant data on antibiotic resistance in outpatient settings exists, and most studies in the United States (U.S.) have identified predictors of resistance in acute-care settings.

- **Objective**: Determine the antibiogram among Escherichia coli isolates and factors associated with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistant gram-negative urinary isolates.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Two primary care, safety-net clinics in Houston, TX, between November 2018 and March 2020.

- **Population studied**: Patients aged 18 and older presenting with provider-suspected uncomplicated or complicated UTI.

- **Outcome measures**: Resistance and predictors of resistance to UTI-relevant antibiotics.

- **Results**: Among 1,265 cultures collected, 372 (28.4%) were positive. E. coli (50.3%) and Group B Streptococcus (18.6%) were detected most frequently. Our patient population consisted mostly of Hispanic (75.7%) females (92.5%) born outside the U.S. (67.3%) with a mean age of 47. Among patients with E. coli isolated (n = 189), antibiotic resistance was highest to ampicillin (63%), TMP-SMX (44%), ciprofloxacin (31%), and cefazolin (30%); no or low resistance against amikacin (0%), fosfomycin (0%), and nitrofurantoin (2.7%) was detected. Approximately 12% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive. Having a prior UTI caused by a TMP-SMX resistant gram-negative organism and being born outside the U.S. increased the likelihood of resistance.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^1178XAiB]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

There was no evidence that using midstream urine analysis as an initial strategy to guide antibiotic prescribing, or the use of midstream urine samples by doctors as part of their overall clinical management, made any difference to ordering analysis during follow-up or other outcomes. As perceptions change among patients and doctors regarding the need for midstream urine analysis in clinical management of uncomplicated infections, the use of laboratory resources for such an unnecessary investigation could be significantly reduced.

- **Conclusion**: All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples, and patients who delay waiting for results of such analysis by more than 48 hours might have poor symptom control. Antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, help reduce antibiotic use.

### Trimethoprim in vitro antibacterial activity is not increased by adding sulfamethoxazole for pediatric Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [^112Xcdhd]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is often used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children. The rationale for combining trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is that they may act synergistically to increase antibacterial activity. However, approximately 3% of patients exhibit allergic reactions to sulfamethoxazole, some of which are severe, such as liver failure and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. We sought to determine whether adding sulfamethoxazole is necessary to enhance in vitro antibacterial activity for pediatric urinary tract infections compared to trimethoprim alone.

- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively identified 1,298 children with urinary tract infections, characterized by greater than 100,000 cfu/ml Escherichia coli, from four American regions. In vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates to sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and the combination was determined using disk diffusion. Ampicillin susceptibility was tested at two sites. At one site, all uropathogens from consecutive urinary isolates were evaluated.

- **Results**: Escherichia coli susceptibility to trimethoprim was 70%, which is comparable to the 70% susceptibility with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.9) and higher than the 56.9% susceptibility with sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.05). This susceptibility pattern showed no regional differences. At two sites, susceptibility to trimethoprim was significantly higher than to ampicillin. At one site, the susceptibility of other uropathogens to trimethoprim and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was similar to that of E. coli.

### Management of urinary tract infections: Historical perspective and current strategies: Part 2 — modern management [^113KKVik]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

An understanding of the microbial origin of infectious diseases and the introduction of antimicrobial therapy stimulated more advances in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the 20th century than had occurred in the previous five centuries.

Numerous resources were used to collect the information described in this review. Medical texts from the 19th and 20th century contain information regarding the traditional contemporary treatment of UTIs during those eras. Early volumes of the Journal of Urology from the beginning of the 20th century describe the first attempts at chemotherapy for UTIs. MEDLINE searches were used to collect appropriate information after 1969. Modern medical journals and medical texts were used to collect information on antimicrobial therapy from the late 1960s through today.

Numerous advances in the diagnosis and management of UTIs were made during the 20th century. Advances in microbiological and chemical assays have facilitated the development of historical uroscopy into modern-day urinalysis and culture techniques, which are the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. Imaging technologies, including x-ray, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance, and computerized tomography, have been particularly helpful in the diagnosis of complicated or recurrent UTIs. Major innovations in nonpharmacological therapy include noninvasive shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous drainage of kidney abscesses. The most profound advance in UTI management during the 20th century was the discovery of antimicrobial agents.

The IDSA 2010 guidelines provide recommendations regarding diagnostic investigations for catheter-associated urinary tract infections, specifically with respect to clinical history. Signs and symptoms compatible with CA-UTI include the new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered mental status, malaise, or lethargy when no other cause is identified. Additionally, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, acute hematuria, and pelvic discomfort are noted symptoms. In cases where catheters have been removed, symptoms such as dysuria, urgent or frequent urination, or suprapubic pain or tenderness may also be present.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^116WfkPT]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

The **design** consisted of a randomised controlled trial.

The **setting** was primary care.

- **Participants**: The study included 309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self-help advice was controlled in each group.

- **Main outcome measures** included symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

The **results** showed that patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms, with the mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale being immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, and delayed antibiotics 2.11 (likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use: immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77% (P = 0.011); and in sending midstream urine samples: immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15% (P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less, with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89).

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

- **Results**: Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: reUTI (odds ratio [OR] 2.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs. 20%).

- **Conclusions**: TMP-SMX should likely be avoided as an empiric therapy for UTIs in settings where resistance rates are elevated.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have evolved. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infections; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that the widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^111tQQGw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

For children with multiple recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTI), starting with intravenous (IV) antibiotics is not obligatory. Each episode should be managed according to presentation. This group is at risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to increased antibiotic exposure. If a child has previously had a UTI with bacteria resistant to all oral options, initial antibiotics can be IV until culture results are available. Intravesical antibiotics, via the urethra or Mitrofanoff, are occasionally used to treat intractable reUTI, with small studies showing successful outcomes with 7 days of treatment. Local irrigation may limit systemic antibiotic side effects and keep children out of the hospital.

UTI with fever alone can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. Severe clinical presentations of UTI requiring initial IV include sepsis (features include hypotension and tachycardia when afebrile) and extensive parenchymal involvement. Vomiting can be a sign of sepsis, but on its own is rarely a reason to start IV; in an observational study, over 60% of children with vomiting were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. For extensive renal parenchymal involvement (e.g. nephronia or abscess), IV antibiotics ensure maximum concentration at the site.

Nonurologic underlying conditions are both renal and nonrenal. A review of UTI post-renal transplant recommended initial IV antibiotics for pyelonephritis to achieve rapid tissue saturation. Although there is a lack of studies concerning UTI management with other renal impairments, in the absence of severe vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), oral antibiotics can usually be used.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^112NZrMu]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms started on average a median of three days previously (interquartile range 3–7), and 63 out of 478 (13%) had symptoms for more than 10 days. The previous duration neither predicted the duration of symptoms after the consultation nor altered the estimates of antibiotic resistance. The most common symptom that patients rated as a moderately bad problem was daytime frequency (397, 78%), and more than half the patients also rated their dysuria, urgency, and nocturia as moderately bad problems. A total of 241 (47%) patients felt considerably unwell, and 214 (42%) rated the restriction of activities as moderately bad or worse.

- **Pattern and duration of symptoms**: Daytime frequency was the longest-lasting symptom, but most other symptoms rated as moderately bad problems lasted three days on average. Around 6% (38) of women did not rate any symptoms as moderately bad or worse. After consultation, 8% (55) of women experienced a week or more of symptoms they classed as moderately bad or worse. Among women in whom no urinary tract infection was confirmed (i.e. patients with so-called "urethral" syndrome), there was a similar pattern of symptom severity to those with confirmed infections.

Compared with patients who had an organism sensitive to antibiotics, after controlling for confounding variables, the duration of symptoms rated as a moderately bad problem was 50–60% longer among patients with antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### Discordant clinical and microbiological outcomes are associated with late clinical relapse in clinical trials for complicated urinary tract infections [^112RrFKf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration guidance recommends that the primary endpoint for complicated urinary tract infection clinical trials be a composite of the clinical and microbiological responses, assessed at a fixed point after therapy. Although some participants meet the criteria for clinical success, they do not meet the criteria for microbiological eradication and are classified as treatment failures. These discordant outcomes have raised questions about the utility of the microbiological endpoint.

- **Methods**: We analyzed participant data from 13 phase 3 clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (N = 4842). Outcomes were determined at the test of cure (TOC) visit, recommended to occur at least 5 days after therapy, and at the late follow-up visit, recommended to occur 21 to 28 days after randomization. Clinical and microbiological success were defined as the resolution of complicated urinary tract infection symptoms present at study entry, with no new symptoms (clinical cure), and a reduction in density of the original pathogen to < 103 CFU/mL on urine culture (microbiological eradication).

- **Results**: Among included participants, 70.7% were concordant successes at the TOC visit, 18.0% were discordant failures (clinical cure/microbiological persistence), and 6.7% were concordant failures (clinical failure/microbiological persistence). Discordant participants were at an increased risk for clinical failure at the late follow-up visit, and the risk of late clinical failure increased with time.

- **Conclusions**: Discordant clinical and microbiological outcomes in these trials suggest the need for careful evaluation of the microbiological endpoint, given its implications for late clinical outcomes.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, which may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments. Prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, contributing to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women, to 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% for older women in long-term care facilities. This demonstrates why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^112UM7hm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have reinfection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control the overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions.

The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTIs, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation, and local estrogen in postmenopausal women received a grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient.

Though considered effective and receiving a grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

### Sulfatrim [^113f8eW1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

- **Urinary tract infections**: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella* species, *Enterobacter* species, *Morganella morganii*, *Proteus mirabilis*, and *Proteus vulgaris*. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

- **Acute otitis media**: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* or *Haemophilus influenzae* when, in the judgment of the physician, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offer some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. At the time of writing, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: Challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles used in managing female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Risk factors for empiric treatment failure in US female outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection: An observational study [^114RdYkp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

More than half of females experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) are among the most frequently occurring infections in the United States (US). The annual incidence of uUTIs is upwards of 1,500 cases per 100,000 females aged 15 years and older. UTIs are often treated empirically, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes, including an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and treatment failure (TF) when inappropriate antibiotics are prescribed.

In the US, 0.3–17% of patients with uUTIs experience TF, with varying incidence largely driven by TF definition heterogeneity. Incidence rates approaching 20% are notable, as TF is associated with increased levels of UTI-related burden, including greater activity impairment and higher direct and indirect healthcare resource use. Patients with uUTI who experience antibiotic TF incur $570 more on average in outpatient visit expenditures compared to those without TF.

At the time of writing, there is a dearth of research assessing risk factors for antibiotic TF in uUTI. In one randomized clinical trial (RCT), treatment with fosfomycin and age 52 years and older were associated with clinical failure, with the latter characteristic also associated with microbiological failure. An enhanced understanding of risk factors for TF could help optimize empiric antibiotic prescribing in uUTI and reduce the burden associated with TF. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for empiric treatment in uUTI recommend considering community-level thresholds of AMR when antibiogram data are available.

### Clonal groups and the spread of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in uropathogenic Escherichia coli [^113gXKkC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is increasingly complicating the management of urinary tract infection. We investigated the extent to which a group of Escherichia coli called clonal group A (CGA), associated with resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), accounted for TMP-SMZ resistance among a prospectively collected set of uropathogenic and rectal E. coli isolates from a university population in Michigan.

- **Methods**: Resistant and susceptible uropathogenic E. coli isolates (45 each) and 79 randomly selected rectal E. coli isolates were evaluated for CGA status using two definitions of this group: the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence 2 (ERIC2)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) pattern A fingerprint and the C288T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fumC gene. We compared virulence gene profiles and molecular mechanisms of resistance to TMP-SMZ between isolates classified as CGA by both approaches to better characterize the relationship between isolates.

- **Results**: Of the 45 isolates that exhibited ERIC2-PCR pattern A, one-half (23 of 45) were resistant to TMP-SMZ, and 16 contained the C288T SNP. The pattern A isolates were diverse, exhibiting multiple mechanisms of resistance to TMP-SMZ and various combinations of virulence factors. C288T SNP isolates showed less variation, with 15 of 16 resistant to TMP-SMZ and a 1.8-kb class I integron bearing the dfrA17 gene present in 14 of 15 resistant isolates. Twelve of 16 exhibited the same combination of virulence genes.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: Results from randomised controlled trial [^115JzJsU]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

All management strategies for urinary tract infections have similar resource implications. The similarities in cost are not surprising, as the tests used in this study have low costs and would entail only small changes to the time practitioners would need to provide care for a patient with a urinary tract infection. Therefore, there is no strong reason to prefer any particular management strategy on the basis of costs. The duration of symptoms was similar between groups, with the dipstick strategy being associated with the shortest duration of symptoms. Compared with the group given immediate antibiotics, the dipstick strategy cost £10 per additional day of symptoms avoided.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The study is based on a randomised controlled trial with a rigorously developed dipstick algorithm and clinical score. The studied group comprised women in whom a urinary tract infection was the suspected diagnosis. They had similar characteristics to national attending samples in the United Kingdom, so study results should be representative of routine clinical practice. Data on resources were obtained from study records or from general practitioners' notes. The cost-effectiveness analysis shown here presents estimates of the cost per day of symptoms avoided. These results should be interpreted with caution because of the lack of significance in the effectiveness data. It is unclear why there were better outcomes in the dipstick group than in the immediate group, as the use of antibiotics was higher in the immediate group (96% vs. 76%). Those in the dipstick group, however…

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^112uCnUB]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Discussion

All five management strategies for managing urinary tract infection in primary care achieved similar symptom control, and we found no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for laboratory testing. Antibiotic use targeted with dipstick testing and a delayed prescription as a backup or empirical delayed prescription helped to reduce antibiotic use.

- **Potential limitations**: Patients' diary records for acute illness are likely to be reliable, and supporting each strategy in a structured manner minimizes any differential placebo effects. Type I error is possible for the subgroup analyses (which must be interpreted with caution), while type II error is unlikely as we had complete results in 277 (90%) patients, providing more power than originally calculated. There was no evidence from auditing the use of envelopes, nor from the baseline tables, that randomisation was subverted. When there were modest differences between advice groups, we tested for confounding and found no evidence. In particular, although frequency symptoms were slightly (though not significantly) different at baseline between groups, controlling for baseline severity did not alter the inferences. The response to invitation, the mixed locations of practices, the range of demographics, and the similarity to observational cohorts should make these results generalisable. There was group differentiation in dipstick use, midstream urine analysis, and the willingness of women to delay the use of antibiotics, but a detailed review of cases suggested that clinicians were likely to want to do a midstream.

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^112PKpHL]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

The study highlights both limitations and strengths. Previous research on acute infections supports the validity of self-reported diary symptoms. The similarity in estimates for antibiotic-resistant organisms and for cases without antibiotic use suggests minimal differential measurement bias. Any non-differential measurement error likely results in conservative estimates of group differences. Type I error is unlikely for the main findings, as these show high significance and a similar pattern in both symptom duration and severity. Complete results were available for 500 patients, providing reasonable power for most comparisons. However, the number who received no treatment was low, and negative comparisons for this group should be approached with caution.

The study controlled for various confounders associated with patients and doctors, unassessed in previous studies, revealing some confounding with a 10–30% change in estimates. By comparing management outcomes with antibiotics to which infections are resistant against no antibiotics — expected to be similar — the study aids in clarifying how antibiotic treatment and resistance affect outcomes.

Most women invited to join the study participated (fewer than 10% declined). Loss of diary information during follow-up was not linked to key baseline variables. The duration of more severe symptoms reported through brief information (3.4 days) closely matched that of complete diaries, reducing potential response bias among those who returned completed diaries.

### Possible animal origin of human-associated, multidrug-resistant, uropathogenic Escherichia coli [^111ebeC4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The multistate occurrence of cases of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ)-resistant Escherichia coli strains belonging to a single clonal group (designated as clonal group A [CgA]) in the United States has raised an intriguing hypothesis that these infections may have been spread by contaminated food products. The present study attempted to determine if CgA strains could be traced to food animals.

- **Methods**: A total of 495 animal and environmental E. coli isolates, which belonged to serogroups O11, O17, O73, and O77 and were collected between 1965 and 2002 by the Gastroenteric Disease Center at Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA), were further subtyped by antimicrobial drug susceptibility, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC2) PCR, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and virulence profile pattern.

- **Results**: Of 495 isolates, 128 (26%) had an ERIC2 PCR electrophoretic pattern indistinguishable from that of the human prototype CgA strain, and 14 CgA isolates were resistant to TMP-SMZ. Cluster analysis of PFGE patterns showed that 1 of these 14 isolates, obtained from a cow in 1988, was 94% similar to a CgA uropathogenic human-associated E. coli strain. The pattern for this isolate was included among a cluster of PFGE patterns for 5 human-associated UTI isolates that were > 80% similar to each other.

- **Conclusions**: These observations suggest that drug-resistant, uropathogenic human-associated E. coli strains potentially have an animal origin.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^116MgLK6]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

A urine sample for microbiological investigation is recommended in all children under 3 months, all children under 16, pregnant women, and all men. An annual average increase in urine sampling for culture of 3% has been reported. We found that microbiological investigation is not being carried out as recommended. However, even if microbiological examination and/or culture were coded for one in four of all episodes of UTI in patients older than 3 months, we cannot exclude lack of recording of this information by some GPs.

As in previous studies, we investigated antibiotic re-prescription as a measure of treatment effectiveness. Because this approach has limitations, we used different definitions of re-prescription: the earliest subsequent prescription of a UTI-specific antibiotic issued within 4–28 days after the initial antibiotic prescription in the primary analysis, and within 6–28 and 8–28 days in sensitivity analyses. However, because of lack of linkage to hospital and emergency services, we did not consider progression of UTI to pyelonephritis and sepsis in the definition of re-prescription and might have missed some events. The percentage of patients re-prescribed antibiotics after an index prescription for the same UTI episode was low (3–4%), but this still represents over 3000 patients each year. We also found evidence of a statistically significant, gradual increase in antibiotic re-prescription over the five years covered by the study. Previous studies have reported rates ranging between 2% when failure requiring hospitalization was studied in a population-based context.

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: A phase 3, randomized trial [^115QdVkW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Time to resolution (days)**: The resolution of all complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) symptoms, survival, and use of non-study antibiotics was assessed. Patients who received rescue antibiotics before symptom resolution or who died without symptom resolution were censored at day 29.

- **Overall response at test of cure**: In patients treated with sulopenem, the overall response at the test of cure (TOC) was consistent across resistance classes and was not impacted by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) activity. Response rates among patients with fluoroquinolone-susceptible pathogens were higher in the ertapenem arm, as these individuals received oral ciprofloxacin for step-down therapy and had lower rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Among those with pathogens resistant to fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or resistant to all three antibiotic classes, sulopenem demonstrated efficacy comparable to ertapenem.

- **In vitro susceptibility analysis**: An additional analysis explored the impact of each regimen on the distribution of in vitro susceptibility of organisms post-treatment. All Enterobacterales identified at any colony-forming units per milliliter in urine cultures, not just baseline pathogens, were examined before and after treatment. The distribution of sulopenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) did not differ after treatment with sulopenem. In the ertapenem group, however, step-down treatment with ciprofloxacin significantly altered susceptibility patterns.

Overall, these findings underscore the potential of sulopenem in treating cUTIs with resistance concerns, providing comparable efficacy to ertapenem across various pathogen resistance profiles.

### Bactrim [^114KxHnU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 µg/mL. The steady-state mean plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4 µg/mL and 68.0 µg/mL, respectively. These steady-state levels were achieved after three days of drug administration.

Excretion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considerably higher than the concentrations in the blood. The average percentage of the dose recovered in urine from 0 to 72 hours following a single oral dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is 84.5% for total sulfonamide and 66.8% for free trimethoprim. Thirty percent of the total sulfonamide is excreted as free sulfamethoxazole, with the remainder as the N4-acetylated metabolite. When administered together as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, neither affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^115yTeVp]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

In women presenting to primary care with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection, the most common symptom rated as a moderately bad problem was urinary frequency, and this symptom on average lasted the longest. Many women also felt considerably unwell and experienced restricted activities. Patients not given antibiotics and those with antibiotic-resistant organisms complained of at least one symptom that was moderately severe or worse lasting five days. Patients rated most individual symptoms as moderately bad or worse for an average of four to five days after they saw the doctor or nurse.

In patients with sensitive organisms or those with unknown resistance (most of whom would be expected to have sensitive organisms), the duration of symptoms rated as moderately bad and less severe was 50–60% shorter. These differences persisted when we adjusted for other confounding variables. Our findings are consistent with previous observations of the association of antibiotic resistance with prolonged minor symptoms. The pattern of results, the persistence of the effects when we controlled for confounding, and the size of the effects suggest that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are associated with clinically important differences in the duration of symptoms.

Patients with the urethral syndrome had symptoms of similar duration and severity to those with confirmed urinary tract infection.

- **Other predictors of symptom duration**: The finding that a positive approach to diagnosis and prognosis is associated with shorter symptom duration supports previous observational studies.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins, with 50% resistant to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near-patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections while minimizing antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives.

Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesized that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They explore the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, dedicating attention to the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice.

The treatment section reviews the recommendations and also highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors further discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^113dJdf1]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for consultation in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly and many are self-limiting, but 11% of women report having experienced at least one UTI and 3% report having experienced three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing, and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTIs in primary care, the pathogens, and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTIs and the tendency to recur leads to high healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treatment of lower UTIs with narrow spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low, considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results. Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised for second or third-line therapy for pregnant women and children aged 3 months or more. The choice of second-line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^112VBrU8]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

There was little difference between groups for further contacts recorded in the four weeks after consent: immediate antibiotics 6/58 (10%), midstream urine 9/52 (17%), dipstick 6/51 (12%), symptom score 8/64 (13%), delayed antibiotics 5/58 (9%); P = 0.79. Similarly, there was negligible difference in the use of midstream urine analysis over the next month: immediate antibiotics 3/58 (5%), midstream urine 3/52 (6%), dipstick 4/51 (8%), symptom score 5/64 (8%), delayed antibiotics 3/58 (5%); P = 0.95.

The average follow-up was 575 days (range 35 to 968). During follow-up, there was no overall difference in time to reconsultation. However, there was non-significant evidence suggesting that repeat consultations might be reduced in the delayed group. As some data for time to first reconsultations were missing for Cox regression, more complete data were used to assess whether reconsultation had occurred, controlling for time between randomisation and notes review. In the immediate antibiotics group, 32/58 (55%) returned, while other groups reconsulted less: midstream urine odds ratio 0.65 (0.30 to 1.40), dipstick 0.87 (0.40 to 1.90), symptom score 0.57 (0.27 to 1.18), and delayed 0.44 (0.21 to 0.95).

Patients who waited for at least 48 hours before using their prescription reconsulted less with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (0.36 to 0.89); P = 0.014. No major adverse events, such as major illness, admission to hospital, or death, were reported for any group, and no significant differences in skin rash or thrush were reported.

- **Condition of catheter use**: An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization
- **Symptomatology**: Absence of symptoms and signs compatible with urinary tract infection (UTI)
- **Bacterial growth**: Growth of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen

### Resistance trends in urinary tract pathogens and impact on management [^114L2rYR]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens is reviewed, and its clinical impact on management is determined. A Medline search, supplemented with references quoted in bibliographies of articles on urinary tract infections, epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, and clinical outcomes in urinary tract infections, was conducted.

Although some geographic variation is noted in resistance rates among urinary tract *Escherichia coli* isolates, rates were highest for ampicillin (39% to 45%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14% to 31.4%) and lowest for nitrofurantoin (1.8% to 16%) and fluoroquinolones (0.7% to 10%). Resistance rates also varied based on patient age. A few studies suggested that antimicrobial resistance impacts clinical and bacteriological outcomes; however, the results are limited by the small number of patients. A randomized trial in women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis indicated that those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a clinical and bacteriological success rate that was significantly lower when the infecting organism was resistant compared to cases where the organism was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Resistance rates among common uropathogens continue to evolve and appear to be increasing for many commonly used agents. Continued surveillance of resistance rates among uropathogens is needed to ensure that appropriate recommendations can be made for the treatment of infected patients.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical examination and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to the severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^112t7zw8]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

This cohort study covers the years 1997–2015, and we have observed a progressive increase in the odds of developing hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury following a urinary tract infection (UTI) in more recent years. The increase in hyperkalemia may be due to an elevated rate of blood testing in primary care, particularly among groups at risk of high potassium levels, such as patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Additionally, improved automatic recording of test results in general practice records may contribute to this trend. The marked increase in acute kidney injury over time, as defined by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding, is well established and likely relates predominantly to increased clinical focus and the adoption of consensus definitions based on changes in creatinine levels. By adjusting for calendar period, we aimed to minimize the influence of these secular trends on our results.

In contrast to previous studies, we did not identify an increased risk of death from any cause in users of trimethoprim. The two previous papers that identified an increased risk of sudden death among users of renin-angiotensin system blockade taking co-trimoxazole used a case-control design with cases defined by sudden death among residents of Ontario over 18 years of follow-up; they were therefore well powered for this outcome. We chose all-cause death as a prespecified analysis owing to a lack of power for cause-specific death, as we restricted the cohort to patients with a UTI to address issues of confounding by indication for antibiotic choice that had limited previous research.

### Bactrim [^114aep8A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

While there are no large, well-controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell, in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.

Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, Bactrim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Teratogenic effects**: While there are no large prospective, well-controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^114Xe9x6]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Non-pregnant women with a suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection (where antibiotic use was not mandatory) were recruited on presentation between June 2003 and September 2005 by 62 general practitioners and nurses in the south of England. Patients were excluded if immediate antibiotic treatment was necessary (if they were pregnant, if they had pyelonephritis, nausea, vomiting, or other severe systemic symptoms), if they were aged over 75 (in older people, symptoms of urinary tract infection might be reported differently), or if they had psychosis or dementia or needed terminal care (as such patients might have been unable to complete the diary).

- **Data collection**: The clinician documented baseline symptoms, clinical information, and demographic details (age, sex, and postcode). The patient kept a daily symptom diary, grading severity on a scale from 0 to 6: 0 (no symptoms), 1 (a very slight problem), 2 (a slight problem), 3 (a moderately bad problem), 4 (a bad problem), 5 (a very bad problem), or 6 (as bad as it could be). The symptoms — dysuria, haematuria, frequency during day and night, "smelly urine", "tummy pain", generally feeling unwell, and restriction of daily activities — were based on the common presenting symptoms of urinary tract infection. The diary format was previously validated and shown to be sensitive to change for other acute infections. There were also questions (Likert scales) on belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, which had good discriminant ability in previous studies, a self-report questionnaire of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and a list of other symptoms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-UTI in patients with:

- **Indwelling catheterization**: An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization.

- **Symptom presentation**: Presence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with no other identified focus of infection.

- **Bacterial growth evidence**: Growth of ≥ 10³ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose urethral, suprapubic, or condom catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: Qualitative interview study [^111JF9Ai]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

To explore the views of women with urinary tract infection on the acceptability of different strategies for managing the infection, including delayed use of antibiotics, and the cause of infection, a qualitative interview study was conducted. This study involved semistructured one-to-one interviews within a randomized controlled trial of different management strategies. The analysis drew on some of the principles of constant comparison to generate key themes grounded in reported experiences and understandings.

The setting for this study comprised seven general practices across four counties in southern England. Participants included 21 women presenting to general practices who were taking part in the larger trial.

The results indicated that women preferred not to take antibiotics and were open to alternative management approaches. With a strategy of "antibiotic delay", some women felt a lack of validation or that they were not listened to by their general practitioner. Women attributed urinary tract infection to lifestyle habits and behaviors, such as poor hygiene, general "negligence", and even a "penalty of growing old".

In conclusion, a clear acknowledgment of women's triggers to consult is needed. If women are asked to delay taking antibiotics, the clinician must address the particular worries that women might have and explain the rationale for not using antibiotics immediately.

### Sulfatrim [^112uUetQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim without a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and those in malnutrition states), and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In individuals deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis may occur, often related to the dosage [see Clinical pharmacology and Dosage and administration].

- **Use in the elderly**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rare, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or those with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible with folinic acid therapy. Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is insignificant in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advised.

### Response to antibiotics of women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative dipstick urine test results: double blind randomised controlled trial [^116MibYa]. BMJ (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative urine dipstick testing.

- **Design**: Prospective, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Conducted in primary care among a randomly selected group of general practitioners in Christchurch, New Zealand.

- **Participants**: The study involved 59 women aged 16–50 years presenting with a history of dysuria and frequency, in whom a dipstick test of midstream urine was negative for both nitrites and leucocytes. Participants with complicated urinary tract infections were excluded.

- **Intervention**: Trimethoprim 300 mg daily for three days or placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: A self-reported diary of symptoms for seven days, recording the presence or absence of individual symptoms each day, followed by a structured telephone questionnaire after seven days. The main clinical outcome was the resolution of dysuria at three and seven days and the median time to resolution. Secondary outcomes included the resolution of other symptoms.

- **Results**: The median time for the resolution of dysuria was three days with trimethoprim compared to five days with placebo (P = 0.002). At day 3, five (24%) of patients in the treatment group had ongoing dysuria compared to 20 (74%) in the placebo group (P = 0.005). This difference persisted until day 7: two patients (10%) in the treatment group versus 11 (41%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The number needed to treat was four. The median duration of constitutional symptoms (such as feverishness and shivers) was reduced by four days.

- **Conclusions**: Although a negative dipstick test for leuco-

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications, and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers, which may be due to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternatively, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is due to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Furthermore, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients, such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications, and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015, over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England, and it remains a first-line option for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death in the general population remains uncertain.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^114EP4of]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, particularly concerning the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend considering the administration of culture-directed parenteral antibiotic therapy. This therapy should be for as short a duration as reasonable, generally not exceeding seven days, for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: A cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance. We designed a decision tree to model the following four strategies for managing urinary tract infections:

- **Empirical antibiotics first**: Followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist.
- **Urine culture first**: Followed by culture-directed antibiotics.
- **Urine culture and empirical antibiotics simultaneously**: Followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist.
- **Symptomatic treatment first**: Followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist.

To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built three versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. The societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non-systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women.

- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews, and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. The date of the most recent search was 7 May 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible, we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain, or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days; and prevention studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main results are based on 15 studies including 1,644 elderly participants.

### Bactrim [^111U5Rsb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim block two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Bactrim has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the "Indications and Usage" section.

	- **Aerobic gram-positive bacteria**: *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.

	- **Aerobic gram-negative bacteria**: *Escherichia coli* (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in traveler's diarrhea), *Klebsiella* species, *Enterobacter* species, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Morganella morganii*, *Proteus mirabilis*, *Proteus vulgaris*, *Shigella flexneri*, and *Shigella sonnei*.

	- **Other microorganisms**: *Pneumocystis jirovecii*.

### Bactrim [^112saqk2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to stop taking BACTRIM immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.

- **Hypersensitivity and other serious or fatal reactions**:
	Advise patients to
	discontinue use immediately upon experiencing symptoms such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice.

- **Antibacterial resistance**:
	Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections such as the common cold. When BACTRIM is prescribed for a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance, rendering BACTRIM or other antibacterial drugs ineffective in the future.

- **Crystalluria and stone formation**:
	Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

- **Diarrhea**:
	Inform patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. However, patients should be aware that after starting treatment with antibiotics, they can develop watery and bloody stools with or without stomach discomfort. Should this occur, they should contact their healthcare provider promptly for evaluation.
