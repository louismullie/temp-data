## Question

transfusion threshold for platelets in patient with epidural catheter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the platelet transfusion threshold for epidural catheter insertion and removal in patients with thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the catastrophic risk of spinal epidural hematoma. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say for neuraxial procedures. Next, I will examine the quality of evidence and how it differs from lumbar puncture. After that, I should consider special populations like obstetrics and critical illness. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline monitoring and documentation needs, making sure I double-check any conflicting thresholds before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Epidural catheter manipulation carries a nontrivial risk of spinal epidural hematoma, which can cause permanent neurologic injury; although rare, the consequences are devastating, so thresholds are generally more conservative than for other procedures, and this shapes guideline conservatism for neuraxial techniques [^c081014c] [^d4a432c7].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The British Society of Haematology (BSH) 2017 guideline explicitly recommends considering epidural catheter insertion or removal when the platelet count is at least 80 × 10⁹/L, which operationalizes a conservative threshold for neuraxial procedures given the severity of potential complications [^ae6f09ab]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: this aligns with older expert opinion suggesting 80 × 10⁹/L as a "safe" level for epidural or spinal anesthesia in the absence of other coagulopathies, reinforcing the conservative stance for neuraxial techniques compared with lumbar puncture or non-neuraxial surgery [^8f9ad2b4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check how this differs from lumbar puncture guidance. The 2025 AABB/ICTMG guideline recommends platelet transfusion for lumbar puncture when the platelet count is less than 20 × 10⁹/L, reflecting a much lower threshold because LP needles are smaller, the tract is different, and the risk of epidural hematoma is lower than with epidural catheters; this distinction is crucial and explains why neuraxial anesthesia thresholds remain higher than LP thresholds [^c099bc48] [^1c810ad9]. I should confirm that this LP threshold applies to diagnostic or therapeutic LPs, not to epidural catheter placement, which it does [^c099bc48].

> I will now examine the evidence quality to ensure I'm not overinterpreting. There are no randomized trials establishing a definitive neuraxial threshold; recommendations are based on observational data, expert consensus, and risk modeling, including a meta-analysis of 7,476 neuraxial procedures showing an inflection point around 70–75 × 10⁹/L where spinal hematoma risk appears very low, though with wide confidence intervals and residual uncertainty [^d4a432c7]. Let me reconsider: given the rarity of events, a very large RCT would be needed to prove a difference, which is unlikely, so guidelines appropriately err conservative for neuraxial procedures [^1e2c797c].

> But wait, what if the patient is obstetric? Does the threshold change? The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) and ACOG endorse that neuraxial anesthesia is generally acceptable at platelet counts ≥ 70 × 10⁹/L when platelet function is normal, there is no coagulopathy, and the count is stable; below 70 × 10⁹/L, decisions should be individualized, and many centers still prefer ≥ 80 × 10⁹/L for epidural techniques to maintain a safety margin [^ff5a82f8] [^bc3735c4] [^ae6f09ab]. I should double-check that this applies to both insertion and removal; yes, SOAP addresses neuraxial procedures broadly, including catheter removal, and emphasizes shared decision-making and etiology-specific risk assessment [^bc3735c4].

> Next, I should review special situations like critical illness and antithrombotic therapy. In critically ill patients, evidence for prophylactic platelet transfusion before invasive procedures is limited and often favors restrictive strategies; nonetheless, neuraxial procedures are an exception where many clinicians accept higher thresholds due to catastrophic risk, and viscoelastic testing has not been validated to replace platelet count thresholds for epidural catheter safety [^518839c8] [^a002519a]. I need to ensure I also account for anticoagulants and antiplatelets; neuraxial techniques should be avoided in the presence of coagulopathy, and timing rules for heparins and LMWH must be followed strictly to mitigate hematoma risk [^e961e579] [^f8cc6a68].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For epidural catheter insertion or removal, a platelet count of at least 80 × 10⁹/L is a reasonable default threshold in the absence of other risk factors, aligning with BSH and supported by observational risk modeling; if the count is 70–79 × 10⁹/L, consider proceeding only after careful assessment of platelet function, stability, etiology, and absence of coagulopathy, ideally with multidisciplinary input; below 70 × 10⁹/L, generally avoid neuraxial procedures unless compelling indications and exceptional circumstances exist, with full informed consent and contingency planning [^ae6f09ab] [^d4a432c7] [^ff5a82f8]. I should confirm that this approach distinguishes epidural from LP; yes, LP can proceed at much lower counts with appropriate caution, which should not be extrapolated to epidural techniques [^c099bc48].

> I need to ensure documentation and monitoring are explicit. Record the exact platelet count, trend, etiology of thrombocytopenia, coagulation profile, antithrombotic exposures, and the risk–benefit discussion with the patient; after any neuraxial procedure in a thrombocytopenic patient, monitor closely for new back pain, motor deficits, or sensory changes for at least 48 hours, as most spinal hematomas declare within this window, and maintain a low threshold for urgent MRI if symptoms arise [^d4a432c7] [^c081014c]. Hold on, I should verify that this monitoring advice is guideline-concordant; yes, SOAP and the meta-analysis emphasize early symptom surveillance and rapid imaging pathways in suspected hematoma [^c081014c] [^d4a432c7].

> Finally, I should reconcile any conflicting statements. Some older or lower-credibility sources mention 50 × 10⁹/L for neuraxial procedures, but contemporary, specialty-specific guidance from BSH, SOAP, and ACOG supports 70–80 × 10⁹/L as the practical range, with 80 × 10⁹/L offering the most conservative and widely accepted threshold for epidural catheter manipulation in general adult patients without additional risk factors [^ae6f09ab] [^ff5a82f8] [^bc3735c4]. I should confirm that this aligns with the meta-analytic inflection point; yes, the curve suggests very low event rates above about 70–75 × 10⁹/L, which underpins the guideline conservatism despite the absence of RCTs [^d4a432c7].

For epidural catheter insertion or removal, a platelet count of **≥ 80×10⁹/L** is recommended to minimize the risk of spinal epidural hematoma [^ae6f09ab]. If the platelet count is 50–79×10⁹/L, decisions should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, procedure risk, and institutional policy; transfusion may be considered if there is a high risk of bleeding or other coagulopathies. For counts **< 50×10⁹/L**, neuraxial procedures are generally avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks and appropriate precautions are taken. There is no high-quality evidence supporting a specific threshold, so clinical judgment and local protocols are essential [^1e2c797c].

---

## Evidence and guidelines

Several professional organizations provide guidance on platelet thresholds for neuraxial procedures, including epidural catheter placement and removal:

- **British Society of Haematology (BSH) 2017**: Recommends a platelet count of ≥ 80×10⁹/L for insertion or removal of epidural catheters [^ae6f09ab].

- **Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) 2025**: Recommends a platelet count of ≥ 80×10⁹/L for epidural catheter insertion or removal [^cc711472].

- **Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) 2021**: Suggests that neuraxial procedures are generally acceptable with platelet counts ≥ 70×10⁹/L, provided there is no other coagulopathy, platelet function is normal, and the patient is not on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^ff5a82f8].

- **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2019**: Recognizes that epidural or spinal anesthesia is acceptable with platelet counts ≥ 70×10⁹/L, but emphasizes individualized decision-making for lower counts [^ff5a82f8].

---

## Summary of recommendations by platelet count

| **Platelet count** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 80×10⁹/L | Safe to proceed with epidural catheter insertion or removal [^ae6f09ab] [^cc711472] |
| 50–79×10⁹/L | Individualized decision-making; consider patient-specific factors, procedure risk, and institutional policy [^ff5a82f8] [^8f9ad2b4] |
| < 50×10⁹/L | Generally avoid neuraxial procedures unless benefits outweigh risks and appropriate precautions are taken [^997ef4ec] |

## Clinical considerations

When deciding whether to proceed with epidural catheter insertion or removal in thrombocytopenic patients, several factors should be considered:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, bleeding history, and etiology of thrombocytopenia [^a1906289].

- **Procedure-related factors**: Type of neuraxial procedure, needle size, and operator experience [^61f2bd85].

- **Coagulation profile**: Presence of other coagulopathies, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, and recent platelet count trends [^f8cc6f68].

- **Institutional policy**: Local protocols and guidelines may influence decision-making [^a1906289].

## Risks associated with neuraxial procedures in thrombocytopenic patients

The primary risk associated with neuraxial procedures in thrombocytopenic patients is spinal epidural hematoma (SEH), a rare but potentially catastrophic complication. The incidence of SEH in the general obstetric population is estimated to be between 1:200,000 and 1:250,000 [^c081014c]. The risk increases with lower platelet counts, although the exact relationship is not well-defined [^d4a432c7].

---

## Evidence quality

There is a lack of high-quality evidence, such as randomized controlled trials, to definitively establish platelet transfusion thresholds for epidural catheter insertion or removal [^1e2c797c]. Most recommendations are based on expert consensus, observational studies, and case reports [^8f9ad2b4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Based on current evidence and expert consensus, a platelet count of **≥ 80×10⁹/L** is recommended for epidural catheter insertion or removal [^ae6f09ab]. For patients with platelet counts between 50–79×10⁹/L, decisions should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, procedure risk, and institutional policy. Neuraxial procedures are generally avoided in patients with platelet counts **< 50×10⁹/L** unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks and appropriate precautions are taken.

In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 10³/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50 × 10³/μL for high-risk procedures. For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50 × 10³/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100 × 10³/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended.

The panel strongly recommends restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion strategies based on high- or moderate-certainty evidence in the 4 populations defined below. Table 2 provides the summary of findings and Table 3 summarizes all recommendations. Recommendation 1. 1: in nonbleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia actively receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1. 2: in preterm neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 25 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1. 3: in patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL. Recommendation 2.

### Use of platelet transfusions prior to lumbar punctures or epidural anaesthesia for the prevention of complications in people with thrombocytopenia [^1e2c797c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require lumbar punctures or an epidural anaesthetic. Lumbar punctures can be diagnostic (haematological malignancies, subarachnoid haematoma, meningitis) or therapeutic (spinal anaesthetic, administration of chemotherapy). Epidural catheters are placed for administration of epidural anaesthetic. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to lumbar punctures and epidural anaesthesia, in order to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended prior to these procedures varies significantly from country to country. This indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians regarding the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding appears to be low, but if bleeding occurs it can be very serious (spinal haematoma). Consequently, people may be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthesia in people with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), interrupted time series studies (ITSs), and cohort studies in CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 13 February 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, nRCTs, CBAs, ITSs, and cohort studies involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in people of any age with thrombocytopenia requiring insertion of a lumbar puncture needle or epidural catheter. The original review only included RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for including RCTs, nRCTs, CBAs, and ITSs. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. Results were only expressed narratively.

Main Results

We identified no completed or ongoing RCTs, nRCTs, CBAs, or ITSs. No studies included people undergoing an epidural procedure. No studies compared different platelet count thresholds prior to a procedure. In this update we identified three retrospective cohort studies that contained participants who did and did not receive platelet transfusions prior to lumbar puncture procedures. All three studies were carried out in people with cancer, most of whom had a haematological malignancy. Two studies were in children, and one was in adults. The number of participants receiving platelet transfusions prior to the lumbar puncture procedures was not reported in one study. We therefore only summarised in a narrative form the relevant outcomes from two studies (150 participants; 129 children and 21 adults), in which the number of participants who received the transfusion was given. We judged the overall risk of bias for all reported outcomes for both studies as 'serious' based on the ROBINS-I tool. No procedure-related major bleeding occurred in the two studies that reported this outcome (2 studies, 150 participants, no cases, very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of minor bleeding (traumatic tap) in participants who received platelet transfusions before a lumbar puncture and those who did not receive a platelet transfusion before the procedure (2 studies, 150 participants, very low-quality evidence). One of the 14 adults who received a platelet transfusion experienced minor bleeding (traumatic tap; defined as at least 500 × 10⁶/L red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid); none of the seven adults who did not receive a platelet transfusion experienced this event. Ten children experienced minor bleeding (traumatic taps; defined as at least 100 × 10⁶/L red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid), six out of the 57 children who received a platelet transfusion and four out of the 72 children who did not receive a platelet transfusion. No serious adverse events occurred in the one study that reported this outcome (1 study, 21 participants, very low-quality evidence). We found no studies that evaluated all-cause mortality within 30 days from the lumbar puncture procedure, length of hospital stay, proportion of participants who received platelet transfusions, or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence from RCTs or non-randomised studies on which to base an assessment of the correct platelet transfusion threshold prior to insertion of a lumbar puncture needle or epidural catheter. There are no ongoing registered RCTs assessing the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthesia in people with thrombocytopenia. Any future study would need to be very large to detect a difference in the risk of bleeding. A study would need to be designed with at least 47,030 participants to be able to detect an increase in the number of people who had major procedure-related bleeding from 1 in 1000 to 2 in 1000. The use of a central data collection register or routinely collected electronic records (big data) is likely to be the only method to systematically gather data relevant to this population.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^1d9012d0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB platelet transfusion guideline — prophylactic thresholds for adult inpatients and common procedures are as follows: The AABB recommends that platelet transfusion be given prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapyinduced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For procedures, the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence), suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence), and suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Platelet transfusion before neuraxial procedures — some professional organizations recommend administering prophylactic platelet transfusions before lumbar puncture for platelet counts ranging from < 20,000 to < 50,000 × 10⁶/L to decrease the risk of spinal epidural hematoma; however, a Cochrane review found "no evidence from randomized controlled trials or non-randomized studies" to define the correct threshold and estimated that detecting a reduction in major procedure-related bleeding from 2 of 1000 to 1 of 1000 would require > 47,000 patients; transfusion risks include transfusion reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload, with 34% of transfusion-related adverse events in the United Kingdom due to platelet transfusion; expected platelet count increases are between 5000 and 10,000 × 10⁶/L for a transfused whole blood unit and between 30,000 and 50,000 × 10⁶/L for an apheresis-derived bag, though responses are variable.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^f6ca0d57]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification

Two articles met the inclusion criteria, allowing the assessment of the safety of LP at different INR and platelet count levels. The search excluded obstetric and oncologic populations and epidural catheter use.

The risk of a traumatic LP was higher in patients with elevated INR. Platelet counts ranging from 50 to 150 × 10⁹/L did not increase this risk, but platelet counts < 50 × 10⁹/L did, although this risk was dependent on operator experience. The risk of spinal hematoma in patients with platelet counts < 150 × 10⁹/L, INR > 1.4 and/or activated partial thromboplastin time > 39 seconds was 0.2%, irrespective of the severity of the abnormality. A strategy decreasing the platelet transfusion threshold from 50 to 40 × 10⁹/L, significantly reduced the number of platelet transfusions without increasing the risk of complications. However, the effectiveness of transfusions in preventing spinal hematomas and the optimal transfusion thresholds remain unknown. In patients with platelet counts < 40–50 × 10⁹/L, platelet transfusion is the standard treatment. Despite the extremely low risk of LP-related spinal hematoma, the consequences could be devastating. Therefore, strong evidence of net harm would be required to deviate from this practice. Given the rarity of spinal hematoma, the panel deemed that a sufficiently large study to answer this question was unlikely. FFP transfusion to patients with an INR > 2.0 is suggested to represent safe and prudent practice. While prolonged INR indicates a deficiency or decreased activity in 1 or more coagulation factors, it does not necessarily correlate with bleeding risk. Further, the INR was developed to monitor warfarin therapy and clinicians should consider the distinction between patients with liver dysfunction and hypercoagulability vs those on anticoagulation therapy. Clinicians should individualize patient factors to decide on whether or not to administer transfusions.

What Others Are Saying

The SIR categorized LP as low bleeding risk procedure with platelet transfusions recommended for counts < 20 × 10⁹/L and FFP administration to correct INR to within range of ≤ 2–3. However, several other guidelines suggest targeting platelet counts > 40–50 × 10⁹/L for elective LP and maintaining INR < 1.5 for neurologic patients and those undergoing interventional radiology procedures.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^313b8657]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical setting 2 — adult patients having minor invasive procedures — features two weak AABB suggestions: Recommendation 2 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: low; strength: weak), and Recommendation 3 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: very low; strength: weak). The rationale notes that serious bleeding complications after CVC placement are rare and often unrelated to the platelet count, that this recommendation is intended to be broadly applicable to adult patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, and that the LP threshold is intended for simple diagnostic or therapeutic LPs only.

Platelets

Two‐thirds of all platelets are used in patients with haematological malignancies, followed by cardiac surgery (7–10%) and critical care (5–9%). Platelet transfusions are the component most implicated in transfusion reactions, as reported by SHOT. Febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions and allergic reactions are thought to occur at a frequency of 1 in 14 and 1 in 50 per‐unit transfusions, respectively and sepsis from a bacterially contaminated platelet unit is the most frequent infectious complication from any blood product.

Platelet transfusion may be indicated for the treatment of active bleeding (therapeutic), although severe thrombocytopaenia is an uncommon complication in cases of major bleeding. In patients with severe bleeding, the following pragmatic guidance should be applied although we recognise that this is not based on high‐quality evidence:
Maintain platelet count > 50 × 10⁹/L
Maintain platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L in patients with multiple traumatic injuries, traumatic brain injury, or spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage

Platelet transfusions are prescribed more commonly to treat thrombocytopaenia and thereby prevent bleeding (prophylaxis). Recent trials in neonates who were critically ill and adults with intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy have questioned the roles of platelet transfusions for either of these purposes. As a guide, in the absence of active bleeding, the following platelet count thresholds should be applied:
Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion: 20 × 10⁹/L
Lumbar puncture: 40 × 10⁹/L
Insertion or removal of epidural catheter: 80 × 10⁹/L
Percutaneous tracheostomy: 50 × 10⁹/L
Major surgery: 50 × 10⁹/L
Neurosurgery or posterior segment ophthalmic surgery: 100 × 10⁹/L
Percutaneous liver biopsy: 50 × 10⁹/L (consider transjugular biopsy if platelet count is below this level)
Routine prophylaxis: 10 × 10⁹/L (consider 10–20 × 10⁹/L in the presence of risk factors e.g. sepsis)

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^39d79440]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB platelet transfusion guideline — scope and target population: These guidelines provide advice for adult patients who are candidates for platelet transfusion and were designed to provide pragmatic recommendations about when platelet transfusion may be appropriate in adult patients. For several common clinical situations, they identify a platelet count threshold below which platelet transfusion may improve hemostasis and above which platelet transfusion is unlikely to benefit the patient; they are not intended to serve as standards, and clinical judgment, and not a specific platelet count threshold, is paramount in deciding whether to transfuse platelets.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^05141810]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Epidural or spinal anesthesia in maternal thrombocytopenia — risk thresholds and aspirin: Epidural or spinal anesthesia is considered acceptable, and the risk of epidural hematoma is exceptionally low in patients with platelet counts of 70 × 10⁹/L or more provided that the platelet level is stable, there is no other acquired or congenital coagulopathy, the platelet function is normal, and the patients are not on any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Although low-dose aspirin therapy is not a contraindication to neuraxial blockade, no data are currently available to determine the risk of epidural hematoma when low-dose aspirin use coincides with the clinical situation of maternal thrombocytopenia. Lower platelet counts also may be acceptable, but there is insufficient published evidence to make recommendations at this time, and for platelet counts less than 70 × 10⁹/L an individual decision based on risks and benefits should be made.

These thresholds are not based on high‐quality data and an ongoing trial is aiming to identify the optimal platelet transfusion threshold in critically ill patients requiring low‐bleeding risk invasive procedures (NIHR131822). One recent trial in the Netherlands concluded that in patients with severe thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 10–50 × 10 9.l ‐1) requiring CVC placement, withholding platelet transfusion was associated with a higher risk of bleeding. However, this risk was largely driven by placement of subclavian CVCs in patients with haematological conditions which is not reflective of UK practice. In addition, there was no evidence of increased risk in patients receiving ICU care even in those with severe thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 10–19 × 10 9.l ‐1). The use of platelet transfusions preprocedure when antiplatelet agents have not been discontinued is not recommended. Specific guidance for procedures related to regional anaesthesia is available elsewhere.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^3d2b285c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB guideline — prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold and dosing in hospitalized versus outpatient care — states that the recommendation based on a platelet count threshold applies to hospitalized patients only, while a more liberal threshold may be appropriate for outpatients for practicality. For dosing, patients receiving low-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions for a morning platelet count of 10 × 10^9 cells/L or less had the same bleeding risk as standard- or high-dose groups, but low-dose platelets needed to be transfused more often due to lower increment. High-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions have not been shown to provide additional benefit and are not recommended as routine therapy for inpatients; the aim is to provide low-dose platelet prophylaxis to patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, either routinely or temporarily during shortages.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical practice guidelines [^1c810ad9]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Platelet transfusion is a frequent procedure with benefits and risks.

Objective

To provide recommendations in adult and pediatric populations in whom platelet transfusions are commonly performed.

Evidence Review

Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to findings from 21 randomized trials and 13 observational studies in contexts of limited randomized clinical trial data. Transfusion strategies using fewer (restrictive) vs greater (liberal) amounts of platelets were compared.

Findings

Evidence demonstrated that restrictive transfusion strategies probably did not cause increases in mortality or bleeding relative to liberal strategies across predefined clinical populations. Exceedingly low incidence of spinal hematoma was identified in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing lumbar puncture. Because definitions of restrictive strategies varied across trials, recommendations reflect practical guidance. The following recommendations are strong recommendations with high/moderate-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 25×10³/μL. In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20×10³/μL. In patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to Dengue without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The following recommendations are conditional recommendations with low/very low-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding adults undergoing autologous stem cell transplant or with aplastic anemia, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not recommended. In adults with consumptive thrombocytopenia without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20×10³/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50×10³/μL for high-risk procedures. For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50×10³/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100×10³/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended.

Conclusions and Relevance

A consistent pattern of evidence supports the implementation of restrictive platelet transfusion strategies. Restrictive strategies reduce risk of adverse reactions, mitigate platelet shortages, and reduce costs. It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies in the decision to perform platelet transfusion.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^a002519a]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — hemostasis monitoring specifies standard tests and INR thresholds: Monitoring of hemostasis is performed with platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio (INR), and a normal INR is considered as 0.9 to 1.2. For epidural injections, an INR of less than 1.5 is ideal for high risk and moderate risk procedures, and less than 1.8–2.0 is ideal for low risk procedures. Advanced viscoelastic tests like thromboelastography or thromboelastometry have been studied for safe epidural catheter removal with the conclusion that the tests were not well validated in this context and there were frequent false negative test results, while a clearly abnormal curve indicates deranged hemostasis and must be taken seriously. The main categories of antithrombotics and anticoagulants are described as platelet inhibitors interfering with platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, anticoagulants interfering with clotting, and fibrinolytics interfering with the final clot.

### The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology interdisciplinary consensus statement on neuraxial procedures in obstetric patients with thrombocytopenia [^61f2bd85]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). High credibility.

Obstetric neuraxial anesthesia in thrombocytopenia — clinical context, population categories, definitions, and platelet threshold are specified: the decision of whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure in an obstetric patient with thrombocytopenia occurs within a clinical context, and the thrombocytopenic obstetric population is divided into 2 categories of known versus unknown thrombocytopenia etiology. For known etiologies, patients with a known diagnosis of ITP have had a workup before pregnancy, and gestational thrombocytopenia involves a normal platelet count before or early pregnancy with a decline during pregnancy to ≥ 70,000 × 10⁶/L. Patients with an unknown thrombocytopenia etiology may include new thrombocytopenia during pregnancy without a clear etiology or those without previous platelet counts. Neuraxial procedures are defined as spinal, epidural, combined spinal epidural, dural puncture epidural, and epidural catheter removal procedures. The taskforce chose the threshold platelet count for neuraxial procedures of 70,000 × 10⁶/L with caveats, acknowledging the CBC has an approximately ± 3% coefficient of variation. A hypothesized lower risk with spinal relates to smaller gauge (25–29 g) "pencil point" needles compared with epidural needles (17–18 g) and larger (20–22 g) "cutting" needles used for lumbar punctures, but the literature to support this notion in patients with thrombocytopenia is sparse, and a review reported the largest number of hematomas in severely thrombocytopenic oncology patients (< 50,000 × 10⁶/L) that received lumbar punctures.

### Evidence review: periprocedural use of blood products [^09e66b9b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Blood product transfusion has not been subject to rigorous clinical study, and great practice variations exist. Of particular concern to hospitalists is the use of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets prior to invasive procedures to correct anemia or perceived bleeding risk. We summarize the known risks associated with periprocedural anemia, prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), and thrombocytopenia, as well as the effects of blood product administration on clinical outcomes. Clinical trial evidence argues for a restrictive red blood cell transfusion threshold (a hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia) for most perioperative patients. There are no high-quality data to guide plasma and platelet transfusions around the time of procedures. Available data do not support the use of prothrombin time/INR to guide prophylactic administration of plasma, and there are scarce data to guide platelet use around the time of an invasive procedure. Therefore, we rely on current consensus expert opinion, which recommends administration of plasma in moderate- to high-risk procedures when INR is > 1.5. We recommend platelet transfusion in low-risk procedures when platelet count is < 20,000/μL, for average-risk procedures when platelet count is < 50,000/μL, and for procedures involving the central nervous system when the platelet count is < 100,000/μL.

Results

Critically ill patients have complex problems that require a thoughtful and nuanced approach to medical care. The recommendations in this document apply to critically ill patients, excluding trauma and neuro-critical care populations, and should be implemented in a hierarchal fashion to optimize treatment. Recommendations 1–3 should be applied initially to critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia, while the subsequent recommendations provide additional guidance for specific situations involving invasive procedures (Figs 1, 2). It is important to emphasize that conditional recommendations inherently require shared decision-making. Readers are encouraged to review the discussion to fully understand the nuances that informed these recommendations.

Figure 2
Platelet and FFP transfusion thresholds for various ICU bedside procedures. The proposed strategy would be exemplified by a hypothetical critically ill patient with a platelet count of 20 × 10 9 /L who is at high risk of spontaneous bleeding and has indications for placement of a central venous catheter and performance of a thoracentesis. Recommendation 2 indicates that most practitioners would consider transfusing prophylactic platelets to this patient. When contemplating the placement of the central venous catheter, recommendation 4 would indicate that further platelet transfusions are not suggested prior to the catheter placement if the platelet level was above 30 × 10 9 /L after initial transfusion. In a similar fashion, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not suggested prior to the thoracentesis, in accordance with recommendation 6. a Suspected portal hypertension related bleed. FFP = fresh frozen plasma; GI = gastrointestinal; INR = international normalized ratio; LP = lumbar puncture.

Question 1: Should critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and without high risk of bleeding receive transfusion of platelets?

Recommendation: In stable non-bleeding critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and without high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we suggest transfusing platelets if platelet counts fall below 10 × 10 9 /L (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Question 2: Should critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and high risk of bleeding receive transfusion of platelets?

Recommendation: In stable non-bleeding critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia who are considered at high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we suggest transfusing platelets if platelet counts fall below 30–50 × 10 9 /L (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

### A patient who received clopidogrel with an indwelling epidural catheter [^a58f5b22]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

A patient with a drug-eluting stent placed 18 months earlier received a thoracic epidural for perioperative analgesic control as part of her thoracotomy. Postoperatively, the patient was started on clopidogrel for secondary prevention. After consultation with the Hematology service and a platelet function assay, the patient was transfused two pools of platelets and the epidural catheter was removed on postoperative day 4. The patient then underwent hourly neurologic checks for 24 hours and was discharged several days later without any negative sequelae. If neuraxial techniques and the need for clopidogrel prophylaxis come into direct conflict, vigilance is necessary for warning signs of epidural hematoma and platelet transfusion should be considered to reverse the effects of the drug.

### Lumbar neuraxial procedures in thrombocytopenic patients across populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d4a432c7]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is currently no consensus regarding the minimum threshold platelet count to ensure safe neuraxial procedures. Numerous reports describe the safe performance of lumbar punctures in severely thrombocytopenic patients but reports of neuraxial anesthetic procedures in thrombocytopenic patients are limited. To date, the focus on specific populations in contemporary reviews has failed to include any actual hematoma cases. This systematic review aggregates reported lumbar neuraxial procedures from diverse thrombocytopenic populations to best elucidate the risk of spinal epidural hematoma.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL databases were searched for articles about thrombocytopenic patients (< 100,000 × 10 6 /L) who received a lumbar neuraxial procedure (lumbar puncture; spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural analgesia/anesthesia; epidural catheter removal), whether spinal epidural hematoma occurred.

Results

Of 4167 articles reviewed, 131 met inclusion criteria. 7476 lumbar neuraxial procedures were performed without and 33 procedures with spinal epidural hematoma. Within the platelet count ranges of 1–25,000 × 10⁶/L, 26–50,000 × 10⁶/L, 51–75,000 × 10⁶/L, and 76–99,000 × 10⁶/L there were 14, 6, 9, and 4 spinal epidural hematomas, respectively. An infection point and narrow confidence intervals were observed near 75,000 × 10⁶/L or above, reflecting a low probability of spinal epidural hematoma in this sample. Of the 19 spinal epidural hematoma cases for which the onset of symptoms was reported, 18 (95%) were symptomatic within 48 h of the procedure.

Conclusions

Spinal epidural hematoma in thrombocytopenic patients is rare. In this sample of patients, an inflection point and narrow confidence intervals are observed near a platelet count of 75,000 × 10 6 /L or above, reflecting an estimated low spinal epidural hematoma event rate with more certainty given a larger sample size and inclusion of spinal epidural hematoma cases. Thrombocytopenic patients should be monitored, particularly in the first 48 h, and educated about symptoms concerning for spinal epidural hematoma.

Thrombocytopenia in obstetric patients — decision aid for when to proceed with a neuraxial procedure directs that if there is clinical history concerning for bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia or an underlying disorder of hemostasis or current signs of coagulopathy, it may be reasonable to avoid neuraxial procedures (Class IIb, Level C-LD). With no such concerns, evaluate hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether findings are consistent with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count); if so, verify Platelet count within 6 hours? and Consider repeat platelet count (Class IIb, Level C-LD). At the threshold Is the platelet count ≥ 70,000 × 10⁶/L?, patients are Likely to be low risk for spinal epidural hematoma, May be reasonable to proceed with neuraxial procedure* (Class IIa, Level C-LD). For cases with unknown etiology of thrombocytopenia, additional hematologic workup may be beneficial prior to proceeding with neuraxial procedures (Class IIb, Level C-LD). Data are limited; for known etiology, For platelet count between 50,000 and 70,000 × 10⁶/L, there may be scenarios when competing risks/benefits justify proceeding with neuraxial procedure* (Class IIb, Level C-LD), whereas For platelet count < 50,000 × 10⁶/L, there may likely be an increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma; it may be reasonable to avoid neuraxial procedure* (Class IIb, Level C-LD). These statements assume patient has no additional risk factors.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^c16c676d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline on appropriate use of platelet transfusion in adult patients.

Methods

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized, clinical trials and observational studies (1900 to September 2014) that reported clinical outcomes on patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusions. An expert panel reviewed the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Recommendation 1

The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 5

The AABB recommends against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients who are nonthrombocytopenic and have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The AABB suggests platelet transfusion for patients having bypass who exhibit perioperative bleeding with thrombocytopenia and/or evidence of platelet dysfunction. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 6

The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous). (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

SOAP thrombocytopenia — patients without a known etiology algorithm: Assess patient for bleeding history and possible underlying disorder of hemostasis and confirm no visible signs of DIC such as bleeding from IV sites, catheters, wounds, or new mucocutaneous bleeding. If there is concern for an underlying disorder of hemostasis or DIC, it may be reasonable to avoid neuraxial procedures or seek expert hematologic consultation before proceeding (class IIb and level C-LD). If the platelet count is < 70,000 × 10⁶/L, additional hematologic workup may be beneficial before proceeding (class IIb and level C-EO). If there is no concern for a disorder of hemostasis or DIC and the platelet count is ≥ 70,000 × 10⁶/L, there is likely to be a low risk for spinal epidural hematoma and it is reasonable to proceed with neuraxial procedure if clinically indicated (class IIa and level C-LD).

The obstetric patient with a known etiology of thrombocytopenia or confirmed hypertensive disorders — assessment steps and neuraxial procedure recommendations are as follows: assess for history of bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia and confirm no visible signs of DIC such as bleeding from intravenous (IV) sites, catheters, wounds, or new mucocutaneous bleeding. For confirmed gestational thrombocytopenia, ITP, or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, if concern exists for a history of bleeding or DIC, then it may be reasonable to avoid neuraxial procedures or seek expert hematologic evaluation before proceeding with the neuraxial procedure (class IIb and level C-LD). If the platelet count is ≥ 70,000 × 10⁶/L, then there is likely to be a low risk of spinal epidural hematoma and it is reasonable to proceed with a neuraxial procedure if clinically indicated (class IIa and level C-LD). If the platelet count is between 50,000 and 70,000 × 10⁶/L, then there may be scenarios when competing risks/benefits justify proceeding with a neuraxial procedure (class IIb and level C-LD). Assumptions include that the patient has no additional risk factors, and clinical context and competing risks might include high-risk comorbidities or difficult airway, need for urgent or emergent general anesthesia, or the choice of neuraxial technique.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^45ae985f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy — therapy initiation and delivery-related platelet targets: Treatment should be initiated when the patient has symptomatic bleeding, when platelet counts fall below 30 × 10⁹/L, or to increase platelet counts to a level considered safe for procedures, and at the time of delivery management is based on maternal bleeding risks with minimum platelet counts of 70 × 10⁹/L for epidural placement and 50 × 10⁹/L for cesarean delivery. Because the platelet function of these patients usually is normal, it is not necessary to maintain their counts in the normal range, and no evidence for a specific platelet threshold at which pregnant patients with ITP should be treated is available. The goal of medical therapy during pregnancy in women with ITP is to minimize the risk of bleeding complications that can occur with regional anesthesia and delivery associated with thrombocytopenia.

### 40 is the new 50: reducing the need for platelet transfusions prior to lumbar puncture in adults with hematologic malignancies [^981763e3]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with hematologic malignancies frequently require lumbar punctures (LP) for administration of intrathecal chemotherapy. With myelosuppressive chemotherapy, thrombocytopenia is common and patients often require platelet transfusions in order to minimize the risk of bleeding during invasive procedures. Guidelines from the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) recommend a minimum platelet count of 50×10³/μL, but this is based largely on expert opinion. As there are few objective data to support a specific platelet threshold, transfusion parameters prior to LP vary from country to country. In accordance with AABB recommendations, the current standard platelet count for adults undergoing LP in the USA is 50×10³/μL. However, in the UK the standard pre-LP platelet count is 40×10³/μL. Platelet transfusion is associated with risks of transfusion reaction, alloimmunization, and transfusion-associated infection. Furthermore, repeated platelet transfusions cause increased healthcare expenses and may delay important procedures.

Arguably, the most significant risks of LP are hemorrhagic complications, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and epidural hematoma. These complications are rare, and while their incidence following diagnostic or therapeutic LP is not well documented, the incidence of spinal hematomas following spinal anesthesia is estimated to be between 1:3,600 and 1:220,000.

Given the lack of consensus on a safe pre-LP platelet count and the need to allocate donor platelets appropriately, Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin changed its institutional guidelines to recommend a minimum platelet count of 40×10³/μL prior to performing LP for oncology patients on November 1, 2017.

After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board and the Medical College of Wisconsin Department of Medicine QI committee, we retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of adult oncology patients who underwent diagnostic or therapeutic LP between November 2016 and March 2019 at Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin. To be included in the analysis, patients had to be at least 18 years of age with a platelet count measured ≤ 24 hours prior to the procedure. The patients' baseline characteristics, details regarding the LP, and laboratory data were obtained by review of electronic health records. The initial platelet count, post-transfusion platelet count, and the number of platelet transfusions were recorded. All platelet transfusions were single transfusion episodes with one unit of single-donor apheresis platelets.

In obstetric patients, thrombocytopenia is prevalent (> 10%) and defined as platelet count < 150×10⁹/L; a SOAP task force concluded the risk of epidural hematoma was low for neuraxial procedures with platelet count ≥ 70×10⁹/L, and because thrombocytopenia increases the risk of SDH after dural puncture, risks and benefits of an EBP should be weighed carefully.

### The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology interdisciplinary consensus statement on neuraxial procedures in obstetric patients with thrombocytopenia [^d3bbebe1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Because up to 12% of obstetric patients meet criteria for the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, it is not infrequent that the anesthesiologist must decide whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure in an affected patient. Given the potential morbidity associated with general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, thoughtful consideration of which patients with thrombocytopenia are likely to have an increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma with neuraxial procedures, and when these risks outweigh the relative benefits is important to consider and to inform shared decision making with patients. Because there are substantial risks associated with withholding a neuraxial analgesic/anesthetic procedure in obstetric patients, every effort should be made to perform a bleeding history assessment and determine the thrombocytopenia etiology before admission for delivery. Whereas multiple other professional societies (obstetric, interventional pain, and hematologic) have published guidelines addressing platelet thresholds for safe neuraxial procedures, the US anesthesia professional societies have been silent on this topic. Despite a paucity of high-quality data, there are now meta-analyses that provide better estimations of risks. An interdisciplinary taskforce was convened to unite the relevant professional societies, synthesize the data, and provide a practical decision algorithm to help inform risk-benefit discussions and shared decision making with patients. Through a systematic review and modified Delphi process, the taskforce concluded that the best available evidence indicates the risk of spinal epidural hematoma associated with a platelet count ≥ 70,000 × 10⁶/L is likely to be very low in obstetric patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to gestational thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the absence of other risk factors. Ultimately, the decision of whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure in an obstetric patient with thrombocytopenia occurs within a clinical context. Potentially relevant factors include, but are not limited to, patient comorbidities, obstetric risk factors, airway examination, available airway equipment, risk of general anesthesia, and patient preference.

### The risk of spinal haematoma following neuraxial anaesthesia or lumbar puncture in thrombocytopenic individuals [^8f9ad2b4]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Neuraxial anaesthesia is increasingly performed in thrombocytopenic patients at the time of delivery of pregnancy. There is a lack of data regarding the optimum platelet count at which spinal procedures can be safely performed. Reports are often confounded by the presence of other risk factors for spinal haematomata, such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents and other acquired or congenital coagulopathies/platelet function defects or rapidly falling platelet counts. In the absence of these additional risk factors, a platelet count of 80 × 10⁹/l is a 'safe' count for placing an epidural or spinal anaesthetic and 40 × 10⁹/l is a 'safe' count for lumbar puncture. It is likely that lower platelet counts may also be safe but there is insufficient published evidence to make recommendations for lower levels at this stage. For patients with platelet counts of 50–80 × 10⁹/l requiring epidural or spinal anaesthesia and patients with a platelet count 20–40 × 10⁹/l requiring a lumbar puncture, an individual decision based on assessment of risks and benefits should be made.

Perioperative Treatment: Chronic Thrombocytopenia

Mitigation of the bleeding risk related to chronic thrombocytopenia centers around the transfusion of platelets. There are inconsistencies and gaps in the guidelines for prophylactic platelet transfusion among different societies and agencies. Spanish, Italian, and British guidelines provide more specific recommendations on the transfusion threshold according to the bleeding risk of the planned procedure. For neurosurgical or ophthalmologic procedures, the Spanish guidelines recommend prophylactic platelet transfusion for platelet counts less than 80,000 cells/L, while the British and Italian recommendations suggest transfusion for platelet counts less than 100,000 cells/L. Though these guidelines may direct the implanting physicians on perisurgical management of the coagulopathy, they do not assist in the mitigation of risk beyond this period of time. However, the NACC guidelines state that SCS lead insertion and removal are the time periods when the risk of bleeding is highest.

Disease State: Hepatic Dysfunction

Patients with hepatic dysfunction are also deserving of special consideration with regard to risk of bleeding complications. Impairments in hemostasis are multiple, and may include thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, coagulation factor II, V, VII, VIII IX, X, and XI deficiencies, vitamin K deficiency, elevated tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels, low levels of alpha-2-antiplasminogen, and dysfibrinogenemia. The typically slow progressive nature of liver disease does allow for compensatory mechanisms to the perturbations in the hematologic system; however, in states of advanced disease these mechanisms are overcome and clinically evident bleeding or clotting disturbances may occur. Laboratory testing of coagulation in patients with chronic liver disease is an important element of a clinician's presurgical assessment, though such tests do not measure relevant compensatory mechanisms, including protein C and von Willebrand factor levels. Perhaps the most frequently considered coagulation measurement, the international normalized ratio (INR), has been repeatedly reported to be an inadequate predictor of procedural bleeding in cases of percutaneous, laparoscopic, and coronary artery catheterization procedures, and others.

Since heparin-induced thrombocytopenia may occur during LMWH administration, we recommend that patients receiving LMWH for greater than 4 days have a platelet count assessed prior to neuraxial block or catheter removal (grade 1C). If blood occurs during needle or catheter placement, we suggest that initiation of LMWH therapy in this setting should be delayed for 24 hours postoperatively and that this consideration be discussed with the surgeon (grade 2C).

Pain management

All patients had one gram of paracetamol administered four times a day. The standard regimen included patient controlled analgesia (PCA) using a bolus of 4 mg morphine as needed and a continuous intravenous infusion of morphine 1 mg per hour and continued in the ward until standardized oral pain treatment with paracetamol and morphine was initiated. Patients who had an epidural catheter were given a continuous epidural infusion of a mixture consisting of ropivacain1.25 mg with morphine 50 μg per mL, 5 mL per hour. The epidural catheter was kept for a maximum of three days postoperatively. Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) could be given as infiltration of a mixture of 100 mL ropivacain 2 mg/mL, ketorolac 15 mg, and epinephrine 0.25 mg given at the end of surgery with additional boluses given eight and 16 hours postoperatively via a catheter placed within the joint capsule.

In the PACU pain treatment could be supplemented with intravenous morphine, ketobemidone 5 mg or fentanyl 50 μg as needed.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation

The rehabilitation program began the day after surgery. The patients were consulted daily on weekdays for half an hour by a physiotherapist. Patients were instructed in range of motion as well as weight bearing and exercises to improve vein flow. Isometric as well as active muscle training were started and transferring and rising from bed trained as well. Walking was initiated the first day after surgery using a high-walker. Walking ability and the need for appropriate walking-aids were evaluated and from the second day this rehabilitation became progressively more active.

Intervention

Transfusion of allogeneic RBC was administered according to allocation but the attending orthopaedic surgeon could decide to give additional transfusion of RBC as a safety precaution. In that situation, the investigator had to be notified and a reason for transfusing was documented. Fresh frozen plasma was given along the seventh unit of RBC or if laboratory tests indicated it.

### Comparison of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of central lines in patients with thrombocytopenia [^e3ddbcd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require the insertion of central lines (central venous catheters (CVCs)). CVCs have a number of uses; these include: administration of chemotherapy; intensive monitoring and treatment of critically-ill patients; administration of total parenteral nutrition; and long-term intermittent intravenous access for patients requiring repeated treatments. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to CVC insertion, in order to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended prior to CVC insertion varies significantly from country to country. This indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians of the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding after a central line insertion appears to be low if an ultrasound-guided technique is used. Patients may therefore be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a central line in patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 23 February 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in patients of any age with thrombocytopenia requiring insertion of a CVC.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

One RCT was identified that compared different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of a CVC in people with chronic liver disease. This study is still recruiting participants (expected recruitment: up to 165 participants) and is due to be completed in December 2017. There were no completed studies. There were no studies that compared no platelet transfusions to a platelet transfusion threshold.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from RCTs to determine whether platelet transfusions are required prior to central line insertion in patients with thrombocytopenia, and, if a platelet transfusion is required, what is the correct platelet transfusion threshold. Further randomised trials with robust methodology are required to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for such patients. The one ongoing RCT involving people with cirrhosis will not be able to answer this review's questions, because it is a small study that assesses one patient group and does not address all of the comparisons included in this review. To detect an increase in the proportion of participants who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100 would require a study containing at least 4634 participants (80% power, 5% significance).

Obstetric analgesia and anesthesia — neuraxial techniques in thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is a relative contraindication to neuraxial blockade, but a safe lower limit for platelet count has not been established. Epidural and spinal analgesia or anesthesia generally are considered acceptable in a patient with a platelet count greater than or equal to 70 x 10⁹/L provided that the platelet level is stable, there is no other acquired or congenital coagulopathy, the platelet function is normal, and the patient is not receiving any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, and in some circumstances epidural or spinal analgesia and anesthesia may be acceptable for patients with platelet counts below 70 x 10⁹/L.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: safe vascular access 2025 [^e4d812bb]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The Working Party noted the recommendations and thresholds for transfusion provided in the British Society of Haematology guidelines. However, the Working Party reached a different consensus, that lower platelet counts are acceptable before transfusion should be necessary (Tables 5 and 6). Local policies should be developed for the management of complex patients as appropriate. Patients who are known to increment poorly after platelet transfusion will need discussion with haematology specialists. Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura or heparin‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia should not be given platelets without discussion with haematology specialists.

Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, do not normally need to be stopped before the insertion and removal of CVADs. Prophylactic doses of anticoagulants do not normally need to be stopped before the insertion and removal of CVADs.

Treatment doses of anticoagulants can usually be continued during the insertion of PICCs and uncomplicated temporary central venous catheters, and during the removal of PICCs and temporary central venous catheters up to 8.5 Fr. Treatment doses of anticoagulants should normally be stopped before the following: insertion of temporary lines for complex patients with anatomical difficulties and multiple punctures; removal of temporary central venous catheters above 8.5 Fr; and insertion and removal of tunnelled CVADs and portacaths. The exact timing of cessation will depend on renal function, bleeding risk and local policy. Recommendations include stopping low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin and dalteparin) for 24 h; stopping apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban for 24–48 h; and stopping dabigatran for 24–72 h.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^4ae50a2e]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

What Others Are Saying

Prophylactic platelet transfusions have been recommended prior to vascular catheter placement for counts < 20 × 10 9 /L by the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies, ASCO, and BSH. ESICM guidelines recommended against prophylactic platelet transfusions for counts > 50–100 × 10 9 /L but no recommendation was issued for counts 10–50 × 10 9 /L. However, these preceded the RCT by van Baarle et al.ESICM and BSH recommend withholding prophylactic FFP transfusions in patients with coagulopathy. However, SIR recommends correcting INR to within range of 2–3.

Research Priorities

Research assessing bleeding risk in settings with INR > 3, mixed coagulopathies, and various degrees and etiologies of thrombocytopenia is necessary. Furthermore, alternative methods for assessing bleeding risk and coagulation abnormalities (ie, viscoelastic monitoring) should be studied.

Question 5: Should critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis receive blood products to reverse thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy?

Recommendation 5A: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis, we suggest against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Recommendation 5B: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis, we suggest against routine prophylactic FFP transfusion (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Justification

Three studies eligible for analysis varied in population characteristics, blood product use, definitions of bleeding, and outcomes (Table 5). Each study encountered issues such as bias, noninclusion of critically ill patients, unreported transfusion indications, and the use of antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Two studies reported no major bleeding in non-transfused groups, while a third noted that 0.2% of patients received RBC transfusions despite no clinical hypovolemia. Overall, major bleeding and the need for surgical interventions were rare.

Table 5
Studies Informing Recommendation 5

Given the risks of blood product transfusions and the unclear impact of transfusions, including thresholds, dose, and timing on bleeding, the evidence favors withholding transfusions. Clinical decisions on transfusions should weigh factors such as ultrasound availability, operator experience, anticoagulant use, platelet function disorders, concomitant thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, and technical or anatomical challenges.

Perioperative transfusion — platelet criteria: Platelet transfusion may be indicated despite an apparently adequate platelet count or in the absence of a platelet count if there is known or suspected platelet dysfunction. In surgical or obstetric patients, platelet transfusion is rarely indicated if the platelet count is known to be greater than 100 × 10⁹/L and is usually indicated when the count is less than 50 × 10⁹/L in the presence of excessive bleeding.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing intraoperative red blood cell transfusion strategies [^6ada223a]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are commonly administered in the perioperative setting. In the United States alone, 11 million units of RBCs are administered annually, of which over one quarter are given to surgical patients. By international estimates, surgical services account for 24%–44% of transfused RBC units among inpatients. Although the need for transfusion is variable, its incidence in the perioperative period can be as high as 50% in procedures associated with a high risk of bleeding. –

Although potentially lifesaving, RBC transfusions are not benign interventions. Risks include transfusion-associated acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, viral transmission, alloimmunization, and a risk of mistransfusion due to human error.RBC transfusion may also lead to transfusion-related immunomodulation, which may be associated with worse oncologic outcomes in surgical patients. Finally, blood products are a limited and expensive, costing up to 761 US dollars per RBC unit in surgical patients.

There is evidence in the literature of significant variation in transfusion practice in patients undergoing surgery, both in the intraoperative and postoperative settings. Risk-adjusted variation in RBC transfusion has been identified prominently in cardiac surgeryand in major noncardiac surgery.– Although a certain degree of variation is expected based on casemix, wide variation that cannot be explained by disease severity or patient preference likely reflects unwarranted variation in clinical care. – A critical examination of factors contributing to this variation is warranted.

Recommendations guiding the administration of RBCs during surgery exist in the literature. – Guidance pertaining to intraoperative transfusion management is generally limited and endorses the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds. However, this endorsement generally relies on evidence from clinical trials conducted in the postoperative and nonoperative settings. The generalizability of these recommendations to patients undergoing a surgical procedure under general anesthesia is limited for several reasons. First, despite a majority of anesthesiologists identifying hemoglobin concentration as the most important factor when deciding on an intraoperative transfusion, it may be less relevant to guide RBC transfusion in the setting of active or rapid blood loss, particularly given the significant variation in hemoglobin concentration with volume of administered crystalloid or colloid fluids. Second, hemodynamic variations in surgical patients are not necessarily reflective of anemia from surgical bleeding, and may result from other factors such as pharmacologic anesthetic agents, patient positioning, mechanical ventilation, neuraxial analgesia, surgical manipulation, and abdominal insufflation. A comprehensive synthesis of randomized trials comparing intraoperative transfusion strategies does not exist, and is thus timely and necessary.

Recommended use of platelet transfusions

The recommendations for the safe level of platelets on the occasion of hemostatic challenges derive from retrospective and observational studies, expert opinion or clinical practice reviews, and are, therefore, based on low-quality evidence. Furthermore, the only studies conducted in patients with IT are the two described above on pregnancyand surgery; however, even these are retrospective and therefore do not provide any concrete evidence. Having said that, prophylactic platelet transfusion is recommended in preparation for surgery and childbirth in IT patients with < 70 and < 50x10 9 platelets/L, respectively. For surgeries where bleeding can have more serious consequences (e.g. neurosurgery or posterior eye surgery), it is reasonable to achieve higher platelet counts (at least 100x10 9 /L). Higher platelet counts are also required for spinal epidural anesthesia (< 70x10 9 /L) because of the theoretical risk of hematoma formation and neurological damage. On the occasion of scheduled hemostatic challenges, a platelet count much higher than 50x10 9 /L may be indicated also in subjects with platelet functional defects associated with thrombocytopenia, such as bBSS, gray platelet syndrome (GPS), ITGA2B/ITGB3 -related thrombocytopenia (ITGA2B/ITGB3-RT), SLFN14 -related thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome/Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia, FLI1 -related thrombocytopenia, and familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) (Table 1).

The recommendations already provided for platelet concentrates to stop bleeding also apply to preparing patients for hemostatic challenges that can be programmed. In this case, however, there is time to search for an HLA donor who offers the greatest compatibility possible to reduce the risk of alloimmunization.

Prophylactic administration of platelets is not required for the many IT patients who have platelet counts above those levels required for the invasive procedure, although it is prudent to ensure the immediate availability of platelet concentrates should unexpected excessive bleeding occur.

Platelet count is not the only parameter to consider when deciding whether to administer platelet transfusions; the patient's medical history also plays an important role. In fact, subjects who had severe bleeding in the past are more at risk of hemorrhagic complications at the programmed hemorrhagic challenge than those without. If a patient has a safe platelet level but had a major bleeding event in the past, they should be evaluated further to identify any other condition that may explain this discrepancy.

Thienopyridines and GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists — neuraxial and surgical timing: There are minimal published data purporting the safety of neuraxial blockade in the presence of thienopyridine derivatives or platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. The interventional radiology literature recommends that elective surgery be delayed 24 to 48 hours following abciximab and 4 to 8 hours following eptifibatide or tirofiban, and surgery performed within 12 hours of abciximab administration will most likely necessitate a platelet transfusion; there have been 3 spinal hematomas attributed to neuraxial techniques and tirofiban or clopidogrel, including 1 patient undergoing a series of ESIs.

There is no standardised threshold for platelet transfusion before CVAD insertion. The lack of a robust evidence base, concern regarding transfusion reactions, and the role of ultrasound‐guided insertion in mitigating bleeding risk have led to a variety of platelet count cut‐offs ranging from 20 × 10 9.l ‐1 to 50 × 10 9.l ‐1. This was addressed in the PACER trial, which examined whether withholding prophylactic platelet transfusion before CVAD insertion in patients with platelet counts between 10–50 × 10 9.l ‐1 and on ICU or haematology wards, was non‐inferior to the administration of a prophylactic single unit platelet transfusion to reduce the risk of catheter‐associated bleeding. Results showed that non‐inferiority was not met, and patients who did not receive a prophylactic platelet transfusion, but had severe thrombocytopenia, experienced more CVAD‐related bleeding compared with those who received platelets. Transfusion reactions were low. It is important to note that the highest incidence of bleeding was seen in patients on the haematology ward, in those with a platelet count of 10–20 × 10 9.l ‐1, and in those undergoing tunnelled catheter placement. Clinician discretion based on experience and patient factors should always be applied in determining a threshold.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical… [^e9df1923]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50 × 103/μL for high-risk procedures. For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50 × 103/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100 × 103/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended.

The panel strongly recommends restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion strategies based on high- or moderate-certainty evidence in the 4 populations defined below. Table 2 provides the summary of findings and Table 3 summarizes all recommendations. Recommendation 1. 1: in nonbleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia actively receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1. 2: in preterm neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 25 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1. 3: in patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL. Recommendation 2.

3: in adult patients undergoing CVC placement at anatomic sites amenable to manual compression, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. Recommendation 2. 4: in adult patients undergoing interventional radiology procedures, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50 × 103/μL for high-risk procedures.

AABB platelet transfusion — patients receiving antiplatelet therapy with intracranial hemorrhage: "The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous)", with "Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: uncertain". Evidence from "Five observational studies (n = 635)" is mixed: one showed increased mortality with transfusion "relative risk, 2.4 [CI, 1.2 to 4.9]", another showed decreased mortality "relative risk, 0.21 [CI, 0.05 to 0.95]", and "Three studies showed no significant effect on mortality rates". An additional study "(n = 88)… had poorer survival than those who were not transfused with platelets". The guideline notes that decisions should be individualized and that in central nervous system surgery "platelets are conventionally transfused prophylactically for a preprocedure platelet count less than 80 x 10⁹ to 100 x 10⁹ cells/L", though only low-quality data support this threshold, and across studies "it was not possible to establish a causal relationship… and confounding by indication was possible.

### Platelet transfusion before CVC placement in patients with thrombocytopenia [^160eba67]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Transfusion guidelines regarding platelet-count thresholds before the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) offer conflicting recommendations because of a lack of good-quality evidence. The routine use of ultrasound guidance has decreased CVC-related bleeding complications.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 10,000 to 50,000 per cubic millimeter) who were being treated on the hematology ward or in the intensive care unit to receive either one unit of prophylactic platelet transfusion or no platelet transfusion before ultrasound-guided CVC placement. The primary outcome was catheter-related bleeding of grade 2 to 4; a key secondary outcome was grade 3 or 4 bleeding. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval of 3.5 for the relative risk.

Results

We included 373 episodes of CVC placement involving 338 patients in the per-protocol primary analysis. Catheter-related bleeding of grade 2 to 4 occurred in 9 of 188 patients (4.8%) in the transfusion group and in 22 of 185 patients (11.9%) in the no-transfusion group (relative risk, 2.45; 90% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 4.70). Catheter-related bleeding of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 4 of 188 patients (2.1%) in the transfusion group and in 9 of 185 patients (4.9%) in the no-transfusion group (relative risk, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.75 to 7.93). A total of 15 adverse events were observed; of these events, 13 (all grade 3 catheter-related bleeding [4 in the transfusion group and 9 in the no-transfusion group]) were categorized as serious. The net savings of withholding prophylactic platelet transfusion before CVC placement was $410 per catheter placement.

Conclusions

The withholding of prophylactic platelet transfusion before CVC placement in patients with a platelet count of 10,000 to 50,000 per cubic millimeter did not meet the predefined margin for noninferiority and resulted in more CVC-related bleeding events than prophylactic platelet transfusion.

Obstetric thrombocytopenia and neuraxial anesthesia — risk threshold and decision factors: The risk of spinal epidural hematoma with a platelet count ≥ 70,000 ×10⁶/L is likely to be very low in obstetric patients with diagnoses including gestational thrombocytopenia, ITP, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, although there may be clinical scenarios where neuraxial anesthetic decisions are made at lower platelet counts. Patients with HELLP syndrome likely require closer monitoring and a more recent platelet count before neuraxial procedures, and because there are substantial risks associated with withholding a neuraxial analgesic/anesthetic procedure, every effort should be made to investigate the bleeding history and thrombocytopenia etiology before admission for delivery. Ultimately, decisions occur within a clinical context that includes maternal comorbidities and airway examination, obstetric risk factors, available airway equipment, type of neuraxial procedure, and patient preference, informing clinical decision-making and shared decision making regarding safety, benefits, and putative risks. System-level needs listed include interdisciplinary knowledge of etiologies of thrombocytopenia and related neuraxial protocols, early consultation with anesthesiology and hematology experts during pregnancy in patients with thrombocytopenia, institutional pathways to rapidly identify suspected spinal epidural hematoma and obtain urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and follow-up care, and population-level data collection via a registry cataloging neuraxial procedures and occurrences of spinal epidural hematomas.

Summary

For all recommendations, high-certainty evidence directly addressing each recommendation was either absent or insufficient. Therefore, our recommendations were primarily based upon expert opinion. This document provides recommendations for platelet transfusion thresholds in non-bleeding patients stratified by risk of bleeding and those with active bleeding. In the procedural setting, the evidence for platelets and FFP is limited but favors a first-line no transfusion approach for vascular, bedside thoracic or abdominal, and endoscopic procedures without biopsy. For LP, given the potentially catastrophic complications, a less restrictive approach is suggested. Despite the lack of high-certainty evidence, these guidelines provide a framework for managing critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Shared decision-making and the implementation of institutional guidelines to standardize transfusion practices could optimize patient care, improve equity in access to blood products and reduce costs. On a large scale, this could amount to approximately half a million less units of platelets and FFP transfused annually. These guidelines should be an opportunity for institutions to develop local policies, monitor their impact on transfusion practices, and provide a framework to longitudinally optimize platelet and FFP use.

### How I use platelet transfusions [^ba0baa0b]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis. The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery (eg, laparotomy). Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

Heparin and low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin with neuraxial anesthesia — timing and safety considerations include that prophylactic subcutaneous unfractionated heparin in a dosage of 5,000 units twice daily is not a contraindication to neuraxial techniques when catheter placement or removal is more than 4–6 hours since last dose; intermediate-dose unfractionated heparin (7,500–10,000 units) is likely low risk more than 12 hours after the last dose, and high-dose unfractionated heparin (total daily dose greater than 20,000 units) more than 24 hours after the last dose with the activated partial thromboplastin time within normal range or the anti–factor Xa level undetectable; in urgent cases before these time cutoffs, coagulation status should be assessed with an activated partial thromboplastin time or anti–factor Xa level and risks weighed; if unfractionated heparin was taken for more than 4 days, a platelet count should be assessed for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; subsequent unfractionated heparin dose can be resumed more than 1 hour after catheter removal; for LMW heparin thromboprophylaxis, needle or catheter placement or removal should be delayed by at least 12 hours after the last dose, treatment doses of LMW heparin (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours) require a 24-hour delay in catheter placement, and if a dose was administered within 2 hours preoperatively, neuraxial techniques should not be employed; there are insufficient data to recommend a specific interval between 12–24 hours for intermediate dose LMW heparin; subsequent LMW heparin thromboprophylaxis doses should resume more than 4 hours after catheter removal; and an individualized risk–benefit assessment is recommended.

Heparin and neuraxial anesthesia — recommendations and timing: We recommend daily review of the medical record for concurrent antithrombotic medications including "antiplatelet medications, LMWH, and oral anticoagulants (grade 1B)". For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia risk, we recommend that patients receiving IV or SC UFH for "more than 4 days" have a platelet count before neuraxial block or catheter removal (grade 1C). For intravenous heparin, discontinue infusion "4 to 6 hours" and verify normal coagulation status before neuraxial blockade (grade 1A); avoid neuraxial techniques in patients with other coagulopathies (grade 1A); and delay heparin administration "for 1 hour after needle placement" (grade 1A). For catheters, remove indwelling neuraxial catheters "4 to 6 hours after the last heparin dose…; heparinize 1 hour after catheter removal (grade 1A)". Postoperatively, monitor to detect motor blockade and consider minimal local anesthetic concentration to enhance early detection of spinal hematoma (grade 1A). Although bloody or difficult neuraxial placement may increase risk, there are no data to support mandatory cancellation; a risk–benefit decision with the surgeon is warranted (grade 1A). We suggest postoperative monitoring of neurologic function and selecting neuraxial solutions that minimize sensory and motor block to facilitate detection of new/progressive neurodeficits (grade 2C).
