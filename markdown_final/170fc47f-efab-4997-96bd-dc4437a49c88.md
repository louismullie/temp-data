## Question

A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has not had her menstrual period for the past 4 months. During this period, she has had frequent headaches, difficulty sleeping, and increased sweating. She has not had any weight changes. Over the past year, menses occurred at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals with light flow. The patient underwent two successful cesarean sections at the ages of 28 and 32. She has two healthy children. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use condoms. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\\nEstradiol 8 pg/mL (mid-follicular phase: N = 27–123 pg/mL)\\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 200 mIU/mL\\nLuteinizing hormone 180 mIU/mL\\nProlactin 16 ng/mL\\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?'
A. Primary hypothyroidism
B. Pregnancy
C. Premature ovarian failure
D. Polycystic ovary syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis in a 36-year-old woman with secondary amenorrhea, vasomotor symptoms, and markedly elevated FSH and LH with low estradiol, and comparing the differential including pregnancy, primary hypothyroidism, PCOS, and premature ovarian insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about excluding pregnancy. Then, I should classify the amenorrhea pattern and age-related etiologies. Next, I will interpret the hormonal pattern to localize the defect. After that, I will apply diagnostic criteria for premature ovarian insufficiency and consider guideline nuances. Finally, I will review why the other options are less likely and outline next steps in evaluation and management, verifying each claim against guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational step: exclude pregnancy, because secondary amenorrhea in reproductive-age women mandates a pregnancy test before any hormonal interpretation, and the vignette does not provide a β-hCG result, so I should not jump to conclusions until pregnancy is ruled out. However, the question asks for the most likely diagnosis given the provided labs, so I will proceed assuming pregnancy has been excluded or is unlikely based on the hormonal profile, while keeping in mind that a negative test is still required in real practice [^111dvfVY] [^116NkcYe].

> Next, I should review the clinical pattern and age-specific considerations. Secondary amenorrhea for 4 months in a 36-year-old with vasomotor symptoms (headaches, insomnia, sweating) and no weight change points me toward an ovarian or central cause rather than a uterine outflow problem, and the age under 40 years raises concern for premature ovarian insufficiency rather than physiologic menopause, which is typically after 40–45 years and diagnosed retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea. I need to ensure I am not overcalling menopause here given her age and symptom profile [^116fv8Zt] [^114kU4Qa].

> Now, I will interpret the hormonal pattern. FSH 200 mIU/mL and LH 180 mIU/mL are profoundly elevated, and estradiol 8 pg/mL is clearly low, which together define hypergonadotropic hypogonadism indicating primary ovarian failure with loss of inhibitory feedback from the ovary. Wait, let me verify the units and magnitude — yes, FSH and LH in the hundreds with low estradiol is classic for ovarian failure, and this pattern is not consistent with hypothalamic or pituitary causes where gonadotropins would be low or inappropriately normal [^111rtShq] [^112GZptU].

> I should confirm the diagnostic criteria for premature ovarian insufficiency. Contemporary guidelines define POI as disordered menses (amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea) for at least 4 months with elevated FSH ≥ 25 IU/L, and they emphasize that a single FSH in the menopausal range suffices when the clinical picture is characteristic, with repeat testing reserved for diagnostic uncertainty. Estradiol is not used to diagnose POI but a low value supports hypoestrogenism and strengthens the diagnosis, so FSH 200 mIU/mL with estradiol 8 pg/mL and 4 months of amenorrhea meets criteria unequivocally [^117BAVan] [^114boC9N] [^111jP62y] [^1163GzRZ] [^1145UHEM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about other options. I will now examine why alternatives are less likely: pregnancy would suppress FSH and LH and raise hCG, which contradicts the marked gonadotropin elevation here. Primary hypothyroidism typically causes menstrual irregularity via elevated TRH driving prolactin and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, not hypergonadotropic findings. PCOS presents with anovulation and often hyperandrogenism but gonadotropins are usually normal or mildly altered, not in the menopausal range, so the extreme FSH/LH elevation with low estradiol argues strongly against PCOS in this case [^116NkcYe] [^111rtShq] [^112GZptU].

> But wait, what if this is functional hypothalamic amenorrhea? I should double-check that possibility because FHA is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea in young women. FHA typically shows low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins with low estradiol due to hypothalamic suppression, whereas here gonadotropins are sky-high, which effectively rules out FHA. Additionally, FHA often involves weight loss, excessive exercise, or stress, none of which are reported here, further lowering its likelihood [^1133sgaq].

> I need to ensure I address the vasomotor symptoms correctly. Headaches, insomnia, and sweating are classic for estrogen deficiency and align with the biochemical hypoestrogenism seen in POI, and although some sources describe variability in symptom expression in POI, the presence of these symptoms is consistent with the low estradiol state and supports the diagnosis rather than contradicting it [^111rtShq] [^114HvRtu].

> Next, I should review practical next steps. Even though the labs are diagnostic, guidelines still advise repeating FSH in 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty, and I should confirm that no exogenous hormones are confounding the results. I also need to check TSH and prolactin to complete the initial amenorrhea workup, consider pelvic ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness and antral follicle count, and evaluate for autoimmune etiologies with thyroid antibodies and 21-hydroxylase antibodies when the cause is unknown. Genetic testing, including fragile X premutation, and AMH can be considered in select cases or when planning fertility care [^1145UHEM] [^116NkcYe] [^112tbvEL] [^116aCnBC] [^112hvscR] [^116WYLAf].

> Finally, I should confirm management implications briefly. Estrogen replacement therapy is indicated for symptom control and long-term bone and cardiovascular health in POI, and counseling about fertility options, including spontaneous conception potential despite the diagnosis, is essential. I need to ensure contraception is addressed if fertility is not desired, as ovulation can be intermittent in POI, and shared decision-making around hormone therapy and fertility plans should be prioritized [^113HQush] [^115dVEoc].

> Conclusion: Given secondary amenorrhea at age 36 with markedly elevated FSH and LH and low estradiol, the most likely diagnosis is premature ovarian insufficiency, which meets contemporary diagnostic criteria and is supported by the biochemical pattern of primary ovarian failure. Pregnancy must still be excluded in practice, but the provided hormonal data are incompatible with pregnancy, hypothyroidism, PCOS, or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea as the primary diagnosis [^117BAVan] [^114boC9N] [^111dvfVY].

The most likely diagnosis is **premature ovarian failure** (POI) [^117BAVan], given the patient's age (< 40 years), secondary amenorrhea, and the biochemical pattern of **elevated FSH/LH with low estradiol** [^111rtShq]. This hypergonadotropic hypogonadism reflects primary ovarian insufficiency [^1153G4f7]. The headaches, insomnia, and sweating are consistent with estrogen deficiency. Pregnancy is excluded by the low estradiol and high gonadotropins, and PCOS is excluded by the low estradiol and high FSH/LH. Primary hypothyroidism is unlikely with normal TSH and prolactin [^116NkcYe].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale** | **Exclusion criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Premature ovarian failure (POI) | - Age < 40 years <br/> - Secondary amenorrhea <br/> - Elevated FSH/LH <br/> - Low estradiol [^111rtShq] | Confirmed by labs and age |
| Pregnancy | Common cause of secondary amenorrhea [^notfound] | - Low estradiol <br/> - High FSH/LH exclude pregnancy |
| Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) | - Irregular menses <br/> - Hyperandrogenism <br/> - Normal/low FSH [^notfound] | - Low estradiol <br/> - High FSH/LH exclude PCOS |
| Primary hypothyroidism | - Amenorrhea <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Weight gain [^notfound] | Normal TSH excludes hypothyroidism |

## Clinical features supporting premature ovarian failure

- **Age**: 36 years (< 40 years) [^116xo8T9].
- **Menstrual history**: Secondary amenorrhea for 4 months; irregular cycles for 1 year.
- **Symptoms**: Headaches, insomnia, sweating (estrogen deficiency symptoms) [^114HvRtu].
- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated FSH (200 mIU/mL), elevated LH (180 mIU/mL), low estradiol (8 pg/mL) [^117BAVan].

---

## Laboratory findings supporting premature ovarian failure

- **Elevated FSH and LH**: Indicate primary ovarian insufficiency [^111rtShq].
- **Low estradiol**: Confirms hypoestrogenism [^111jP62y].
- **Normal prolactin**: Excludes hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea [^115dXdb8].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **premature ovarian failure** [^117Df1cB], given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) — we suggest diagnostic evaluation for FHA in adolescents and women whose menstrual cycle interval persistently exceeds 45 days and/or those who present with amenorrhea for 3 months or more. Adolescents or young women with FHA typically report amenorrhea for 6 months or longer, and reports indicate that menstrual cycles in adolescents typically do not exceed 45 days, even during the first postmenarchal year.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115CDkDS]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of the patient — initial approach in most patients with amenorrhea — History, physical examination, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) estimation, and estradiol (E2) will identify the most common causes of amenorrhea. The presence of breast development means there has been previous estrogen action, and excessive testosterone secretion is suggested most often by hirsutism and rarely by increased muscle mass or other signs of virilization. The history and physical examination should include a thorough assessment of the external and internal genitalia as well as a breast examination. When the physical examination is normal (in most of the cases), the initial investigations should exclude pregnancy, estimate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin concentrations, and check FSH levels.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^111aHKX3]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Primary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes that physical examination is key, with pelvic examination revealing abnormal findings in approximately 15% of patients with primary amenorrhea; a blind or absent vagina indicates outflow tract obstruction or congenital absence of the uterus, visualization of the cervix indicates the presence of a uterus, and if a pelvic examination is not feasible an abdominal ultrasound may be useful to confirm the presence or absence of the uterus, although abdominal ultrasound may have limitations in its ability to detect a rudimentary or prepubertal uterus; the presence of breast development indicates previous estrogen action, absent breast development is typically indicative of hypogonadism including hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic causes; depending on physical examination findings, laboratory evaluation may be indicated, with karyotype and testosterone level useful when congenital absence of the uterus is confirmed, serum FSH helpful when a uterus is present but no breast development, and when both breast development and a uterus are present, laboratory evaluation similar to that conducted for secondary amenorrhea is appropriate.

### Current understanding of hypothalamic amenorrhoea [^111WMRSH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HA is a common cause of amenorrhoea in women of reproductive age, which can go unrecognised. Thorough clinical evaluation is crucial in order to diagnose these women, establish the causative factor and initiate treatment appropriately. Treatment options need to be personalised and tend to focus on alleviating the underlying nutritional or psychosocial stress by lifestyle and behavioural interventions. Emerging hormonal therapies may prove useful in the future, especially in those women who do not respond to first-line behavioural treatment.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115dXdb8]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — prolactin and macroprolactin: Circulating levels in the range of 15–20 ng/mL will exclude hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea, and macroprolactinemia (molecular weight > 100 kDa) must be considered as a mechanism for persistently elevated prolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly MRI imaging, and because macroprolactin is biologically inert, macroprolactinemia is unlikely to be a cause of secondary amenorrhea.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^116xD4wk]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^114kU4Qa]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Premature and early menopauses

Nonsurgical mid-life cessation of menses can occur outside of the expected age range. Entering menopause before age 45 is considered "early", whereas entering menopause before age 40 is designated as "premature" and is termed Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). The prevalence of these two types is estimated at about 5% and 1% to 2%, respectively. Progress of early menopause typically follows the same stages as spontaneous menopause. A diagnosis of POI, however, requires two occasions of amenorrhea for over 4 months, accompanied by documented elevation in circulating gonadotrophins (serum FSH concentration > 40 IU/L), reduced circulating androgens, and low E 2 levels. In addition, the decline in ovarian function in POI does not compare with spontaneous menopause, as hormone levels can be extremely variable and some women have reported spontaneous return of menses or even pregnancy. There is also an inconsistent and varied symptom experience for women with POI, with additional symptoms like hair loss, dry eyes, cold intolerance, joint clicking, and hypothyroidism.

POI and early menopause are often linked to underlying factors beyond gonadal hormone levels. Cigarette smoking, high body mass index, and low socioeconomic status have all been associated with POI and early menopause. POI has been linked with genetic abnormalities, metabolic or autoimmune disorders, infections, and enzyme deficiencies, though it is often idiopathic. Recent research also suggests that women with POI do not report a reduction in menopausal symptoms with aging.

Notably, ovary-sparing hysterectomy can reduce the age of menopause by an average of 4 years through compromise of ovarian function, related to age at surgery. A prominent hypotheses for ovarian cessation after uterine removal is that the surgery affects blood flow to the ovaries, but evidence for this is mixed. Other possible causes are that the uterus itself regulates pituitary FSH secretion and thus affects follicle development. It may also be that the condition that led to hysterectomy increases the risk for ovarian failure. Thus, depending on the timing of surgery, gradual ovarian cessation before age 45 due to hysterectomy might be considered noninduced, early menopause.

### FSH receptor variant: an unusual cause of secondary amenorrhea [^117Ejigc]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary amenorrhea with high Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels and low estradiol is typically diagnosed as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in individuals under the age of 40. Low anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels support the diagnosis of POI, but normal AMH levels warrant additional evaluation.

Case Presentation

A 19-year-old female with menarche at age 12 experienced secondary amenorrhea at age 14.5. Initial evaluation showed elevated gonadotropins and low estradiol, which were confirmed on repeat testing. Normal karyotype, no FMR1 repeat expansion, negative autoimmune markers, and normal AMH levels were found. Genetic testing revealed two Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) gene variants with high suspicion of pathogenicity.

Discussion

Pathogenic variants in the FSHR gene are an uncommon cause of secondary amenorrhea. Atypical POI cases with a normal AMH level should be evaluated with a genetic consultation.

### Case of an atypical pituitary abscess [^112rQKCE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 36-year-old caucasian woman presented to the endocrinology clinic for a preoperative evaluation of an enlarging pituitary lesion. She had a medical history of ankylosing spondylitis previously managed on immune modulating therapy but had stopped 1 year prior to presentation. Two years prior, she was diagnosed with a pituitary macroadenoma during an evaluation of secondary amenorrhea. Biochemical evaluation was negative for hypersecretion but did reveal secondary hypothyroidism: thyrotropin (TSH) 0.789 uIU/mL (normal 0.27–4.2), free thyroxine (FT4) 0.75 ng/dL (normal 0.93–1.7), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 2.9 mIU/mL (normal follicular phase 3.5–12.5, ovulation phase 4.7–21.5), luteinising hormone (LH) 2.44 mIU/mL (normal follicular phase 2.4–12.6, ovulation phase 14.0–95.6), estradiol < 5.0 pg/mL (normal follicular phase 12.4–233, ovulation phase 41.0–398). Visual field exam at that time was unremarkable. A pituitary MRI showed a 1.9 cm lesion with cystic features, suggestive of a cystic adenoma. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up until she presented again complaining of worsening vision, headaches and weight loss. She had been in her usual state of health until about 6 months prior to presentation when she developed acute worsening of her chronic headaches followed by unintentional weight loss of 30 pounds over 6 months. The patient denied recent illness or fevers. Repeat pituitary MRI at this time revealed interval growth of the lesion to 2.6 cm with a new signal intensity in the cystic cavity suggestive of haemorrhage and compression of the optic chiasm (figure 1).

### French Endocrine Society guidance on endocrine side effects of immunotherapy [^117RZmek]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

R5.1a: The diagnosis of hypophysitis during ICPI should be considered in patients with clinical symptoms evocative of hypophysitis (most frequently headaches and fatigue) and/or hyponatremia and/or pituitary deficiency and/or abnormal pituitary imaging.

R5.1b: There is no indication for confirmation of diagnosis of hypophysitis, during ICPI, by histology of a surgical biopsy in the absence of an argument supporting the presence of another pituitary pathology such as a metastasis.

R5.1c: In case of suspected hypophysitis, we recommend the following tests:

Blood electrolytes
Assays for hormones, including: Free T4 (and TSH due to the risk of thyroid abnormalities on ICPI). Plasma cortisol and ACTH (in the context of rare cases described of PAI) at 08:00 h (except in acute situations, cf R6.1b) in the absence of treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids, with dynamic tests depending on these results. LH, FSH and estradiol in premenopausal women not taking oral contraceptives for menstrual problems or FSH in post-menopausal women. LH, FSH and total testosterone in men. Prolactin levels.

It is also important

To look for clinical signs of polyuric–polydipsic syndrome.
To perform a pituitary MRI without and with gadolinium injection, ideally in the acute phase, with the goal of confirming the diagnosis and eliminating differential diagnoses (notably of pituitary metastasis). A normal image on MRI does not exclude the diagnosis.

In case of abnormal MRI suggestive of hypophysitis, without pituitary deficiency, closer monitoring of hormone levels should be put in place, as symptoms and pituitary deficiencies can appear in a second phase.

R5.1d: In case of MRI results suggestive of hypophysitis but in the absence of pituitary deficiency, closer monitoring of 08:00 h cortisol levels (weekly during 1 month and then at normal intervals) should be established.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — hyperandrogenism testing approach: In the workup for hyperandrogenism, familiarity with local reference ranges is important, as assays are not standardized across laboratories; clinicians should obtain total or free testosterone levels (depending on assay reliability and noting that the former is usually more accurate), and clinicians should also consider measuring serum DHEA-S to rule out adrenal etiologies; some experts consider an elevated free testosterone level (measuring both total and free testosterone using a gold standard assay) the most useful indicator of PCOS.

Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), including hot flashes or flushes and night sweats, are the most frequently observed symptoms during menopause and result from systemic hypoestrogenism. The average woman in the United States experiences VMS for 7.4 years, and women who report VMS during the perimenopause are usually symptomatic for a median of 11.8 years. African American women have the longest duration of VMS, with a median of 10.8 years.VMS, especially drenching night sweats, disrupt the sleep of menopausal women and can lead to fatigue, irritability, anxiety, and other symptoms associated with chronic sleep deprivation.VMS are likely linked to cardiovascular risk and disease, possibly due to the effect of these symptoms on sleep, diet, and exercise tolerance.

The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) results from the local, genital response to chronic systemic hypoestrogenism. With sustained hypoestrogenism, genital tract cell proliferation and differentiation are reduced, leading to increased permeability and friability of the protective epithelial barrier, recruitment of lymphocytes, and a chronic, subclinical inflammatory infiltrate. Low systemic estradiol (E 2) concentrations during menopause are associated with a rise in vaginal pH and a decrease in glycogen, fostering a decrease in the Lactobacillus populationand the establishment of an anaerobe-dominated vaginal microbiota, which in synchrony with epithelial compromise attracts and activates immune cells leading to heightened mucosal susceptibility to infection. Women with moderate-to-severe GSM experience common symptoms such as vaginal dryness, vaginal or vulvar itching, and burning and painful intercourse.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^114Cckht]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^116htbJC]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — conclusions and diagnostic approach emphasize that estrogen plus progestin may be a better strategy to differentiate hypoestrogenemia-related amenorrhea from endometrial scarring, noting that both false positive and negative progestin withdrawal tests (PWT) can occur and that other approaches may yield a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Most cases of primary and secondary amenorrhea are similar, and most causes are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. Initial assessment highlights that history, physical examination, and estimation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol will identify the most common causes; most patients presenting with amenorrhea should undergo measurements of serum prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and pregnancy should be excluded. For primary amenorrhea, physical examination and measurement of gonadotropins are key, and the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone may be less for secondary compared with primary amenorrhea.

### Some clues and pitfalls in the diagnosis of acromegaly [^111oVkxP]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of acromegaly in a young woman using oral contraceptives who had nonspecific symptoms and persistent hyperphosphatemia and to analyze the reasons for delay in diagnosis.

Methods

A 31-year-old woman underwent evaluation for failure of menstrual flow to resume after discontinued use of oral contraceptives. Clinical and laboratory findings are summarized, and atypical manifestations of acromegaly are discussed.

Results

The patient complained of weight gain, acne, and increased facial hair growth, and laboratory tests showed a low estradiol level and hyperinsulinemia. "Post-pill amenorrhea" and polycystic ovary syndrome were considered possible diagnoses. During subsequent endocrinology consultation, hyperphosphatemia was present on three occasions during a 7-month period. Hormonal studies for evaluation of pituitary function revealed increased insulin-like growth factor-I and growth hormone (GH) levels. Acromegaly was suspected, and the increased GH level failed to suppress after a glucose load. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary macro-adenoma with suprasellar extension. Visual field testing showed bitemporal abnormalities. Transsphenoidal resection successfully removed the GH-producing tumor, and hormone replacement therapy was initiated postoperatively.

Conclusion

The textbook presentation of GH excess is a late feature of acromegaly. The diagnosis in a young woman can be easily missed when clinicopathologic findings are not classic and the picture is further clouded by factors such as oral contraceptive use. Features may also resemble polycystic ovary syndrome, a more common condition in women of childbearing age. This case also illustrates that hyperphosphatemia, overlooked in this patient, can precede the full-blown clinical manifestations of acromegaly and serve as a subtle clue to the underlying disease. Awareness of these situations and screening for high GH levels in patients with unexplained, persistent hyperphosphatemia are advisable for making an early correct diagnosis and providing appropriate therapy.

What is primary or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)?

Primary or premature ovarian insufficiency is a spectrum disorder of ovarian dysfunction that differs considerably among women. In its mildest form, POI may present as diminished ovarian reserve with subfertility and often an elevated FSH level in a woman's fourth decade of life. However, more severe forms of POI will present with primary amenorrhea in the young adolescent with absent sex steroid production and a complete lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Many women with POI have an intermediate phenotype, with normal progression through puberty and later onset of irregular to absent menstrual cycles and/or infertility. Proposed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of intermediate POI include secondary amenorrhea for at least 4 consecutive months or more, prior to the age of 40, in the setting of low estradiol and elevated FSH (Goswami and Conway; Welt).

The term "primary ovarian insufficiency" was first used in the literature more than 60 years ago (Albright) and was re-introduced recently as a more appropriate term to replace less encompassing, compassionate, and descriptive terms such as "premature ovarian failure" or "premature menopause" that had come into use (Welt). POI is not, in fact, the early onset of natural menopause. Many women with POI experience irregular ovarian function after their diagnosis, with months of regular menses and ovulation alternating with intervals of amenorrhea and hypoestrogenism. Antral follicle counts, determined by ultrasound, and serum FSH levels may vary considerably. This fluctuating course of ovarian function is seldom seen once a woman has experienced natural menopause and amenorrhea at a more typical age. Of note, 5–10% of women given a diagnosis of POI may still spontaneously conceive, and there is very little evidence that any current treatment increases this rate (Van Kasteren and Schoemaker).

### Amenorrhea: evaluation and treatment [^111bUycg]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

A thorough history and physical examination as well as laboratory testing can help narrow the differential diagnosis of amenorrhea. In patients with primary amenorrhea, the presence or absence of sexual development should direct the evaluation. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty commonly causes primary amenorrhea in patients with no sexual development. If the patient has normal pubertal development and a uterus, the most common etiology is congenital outflow tract obstruction with a transverse vaginal septum or imperforate hymen. If the patient has abnormal uterine development, müllerian agenesis is the likely cause and a karyotype analysis should confirm that the patient is 46, XX. If a patient has secondary amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. The treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhea is based on the causative factor. Treatment goals include prevention of complications such as osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and heart disease; preservation of fertility; and, in primary amenorrhea, progression of normal pubertal development.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^111bzBFD]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnostic investigations — HCPs should diagnose POI based on the presence of spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles and biochemical confirmation. The guideline group recommends the following diagnostic criteria: disordered menstrual cycles (spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles) for at least 4 months, and an elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration ≥ 25 IU/l. FSH assessment should be repeated after 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty, and FSH testing for the diagnosis of POI does not have to be timed to a specific day of the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy should be excluded in women presenting with amenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy (including oral, injectable, or long-acting contraceptives) may conceal or cause amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles, and potentially lower FSH concentrations; some hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive) may need to be ceased before a diagnosis of POI can be confirmed. Women who have had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 40 have a diagnosis of POI and additional diagnostic testing is unnecessary. The guideline group does not recommend diagnosing POI based on serum estradiol concentrations; however, a low estradiol concentration indicates hypoestrogenism, and in combination with an elevated FSH concentration, provides additional confirmation of the POI diagnosis.

### Amenorrhea: a systematic approach to diagnosis and management [^113HQush]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Menstrual patterns can be an indicator of overall health and self-perception of well-being. Primary amenorrhea, defined as the lifelong absence of menses, requires evaluation if menarche has not occurred by 15 years of age or three years post-thelarche. Secondary amenorrhea is characterized by cessation of previously regular menses for three months or previously irregular menses for six months and warrants evaluation. Clinicians may consider etiologies of amenorrhea categorically as outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. The history should include menstrual onset and patterns, eating and exercise habits, presence of psychosocial stressors, body weight changes, medication use, galactorrhea, and chronic illness. Additional questions may target neurologic, vasomotor, hyperandrogenic, or thyroid-related symptoms. The physical examination should identify anthropometric and pubertal development trends. All patients should be offered a pregnancy test and assessment of serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Additional testing, including karyotyping, serum androgen evaluation, and pelvic or brain imaging, should be individualized. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovary function and may require hormone replacement therapy, contraception, or infertility services. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may indicate disordered eating and low bone density. Treatment should address the underlying cause. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should undergo screening and intervention to attenuate metabolic disease and endometrial cancer risk. Amenorrhea can be associated with clinically challenging pathology and may require lifelong treatment. Patients will benefit from ample time with the clinician, sensitivity, and emotional support.

Menopause

NICE states that diagnosis of menopause can be made without laboratory investigations in women aged > 45 years who have not menstruated for at least 12 months, excluding women using hormonal contraception or who do not have a uterus. Perimenopause, which can precede menopause by several years, is defined as irregularity of ovulation cycles and menstruation, associated with vasomotor symptoms such as night sweats and hot flushes.

The mean age of menopause is 51.5 years and occurs secondary to depletion of ovarian follicles. Initially, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) levels begin to rise, followed by an increase in the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Progesterone and oestrogen levels then fall, with the latter being associated with irregular menstruation, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness and breast atrophy.

Premature menopause is diagnosed in women aged < 40 years with menopausal symptoms and laboratory tests demonstrating elevated FSH on two occasions 4–6 weeks apart. Most frequently, premature menopause is secondary to ovarian failure, the cause of which is often unknown but can be autoimmune or genetic. Oophorectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be associated with premature menopause.

Oestrogen is synthesized from the ovaries and peripheral tissue, including the skin (Fig. 1). In premenopausal women, ovarian synthesis predominates, contrasting with the predominant synthesis from adipose tissue in postmenopausal women. The enzyme aromatase is key in oestrogen synthesis, and is present in many organs, including the skin. Oestrogen acts via two receptors, ER‐α and ER‐β; the latter is seen predominately within the skin, mucosa and hair follicles.

Figure 1
Oestrogen synthesis pathway.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) refers to the oral, transdermal or vaginal administration of oestrogen, progesterone and/or testosterone to alleviate symptoms and improve bone density. Although generally well tolerated, an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer has been associated with HRT.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^113qHJwk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer — definition of menopause and diagnostic criteria state that menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis, and is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea; natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 years. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact or may resume over time, with the likelihood of resuming after chemotherapy higher among those aged < 40 years. Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression; FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause, and FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy; Age ≥ 60 years; Age < 60 with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range; Age < 60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments; Age < 60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range. Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1117ZBmJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

The many menopauses

Spontaneous menopause

Spontaneous menopause (often referred to as "natural menopause") is diagnosed retrospectively after a year has elapsed since a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). The majority of women experience menopause between 45 and 55 years of age. Before the cessation of menses, women enter the menopausal transition (perimenopause); cycle lengths become variable as hormone levels begin to fluctuate and gradually fall. With fewer follicles maturing in the aging ovaries, levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) become elevated due to disinhibition, although 17β-estradiol (E 2) levels become highly variable. On average, the perimenopausal period lasts about 4 years. After the LMP, both E 2 and progesterone remain circulating at very low levels (2–35 pg/mL and 0–0.8 ng/mL, respectively), although high FSH levels stabilize. Postmenopausal women also produce low but stable quantities of androgens such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroandrosterone (DHA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS). In most postmenopausal women, reduction in ovarian hormones is associated with the emergence of physiological symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness.

### Approach to the patient with new-onset secondary amenorrhea: is this primary ovarian insufficiency? [^112Mf9JY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Menstrual cyclicity is a marker of health for reproductively mature women. Absent menses, or amenorrhea, is often the initial sign of pregnancy-an indication that the system is functioning appropriately and capable of generating the intended evolutionary outcome. Perturbations of menstrual regularity in the absence of pregnancy provide a marker for physiological or pathological disruption of this well-orchestrated process. New-onset amenorrhea with duration of 3 to 6 months should be promptly evaluated. Secondary amenorrhea can reflect structural or functional disturbances occurring from higher centers in the hypothalamus to the pituitary, the ovary, and finally, the uterus. Amenorrhea can also be a manifestation of systemic disorders resulting in compensatory inhibition of reproduction. Identifying the point of the breakdown is essential to restoring reproductive homeostasis to maintain future fertility and reestablish reproductive hormonal integrity. Among the most challenging disorders contributing to secondary amenorrhea is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). This diagnosis stems from a number of possible etiologies, including autoimmune, genetic, metabolic, toxic, iatrogenic, and idiopathic, each with associated conditions and attendant medical concerns. The dual assaults of unanticipated compromised fertility concurrently with depletion of the normal reproductive hormonal milieu yield multiple management challenges. Fertility restoration is an area of active research, while optimal management of estrogen deficiency symptoms and the anticipated preventive benefits of hormone replacement for bone, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive health remain understudied. The state of the evidence for an optimal, individualized, clinical management approach to women with POI is discussed along with priorities for additional research in this population.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^111dvfVY]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes first excluding pregnancy and then using a stepwise workup: The possibility of pregnancy must be at the forefront of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea, and once pregnancy has been ruled out, a stepwise approach to evaluation is recommended, as outlined in Figure 2; in contrast to primary amenorrhea, the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone is less; a thorough history and reproductive hormone profile constitute the backbone of diagnostic evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound, if accessible and available, can help streamline evaluation early in the process; in many cases, only a few of the tests listed in Figure 2 are necessary, and the temporal pattern of menses since the onset of menarche is informative.

### Amenorrhea: an approach to diagnosis and management [^117UFmGd]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea may result from a number of different conditions, a systematic evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment of selected serum hormone levels can usually identify the underlying cause. Primary amenorrhea, which by definition is failure to reach menarche, is often the result of chromosomal irregularities leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (e.g. Turner syndrome) or anatomic abnormalities (e.g. Müllerian agenesis). Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for three months or the cessation of irregular menses for six months. Most cases of secondary amenorrhea can be attributed to polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, or primary ovarian insufficiency. Pregnancy should be excluded in all cases. Initial workup of primary and secondary amenorrhea includes a pregnancy test and serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovarian function and should not be presumed infertile. Patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea should be evaluated for eating disorders and are at risk for decreased bone density. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at risk for glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and other aspects of metabolic syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome (or variant) should be treated by a physician familiar with the appropriate screening and treatment measures. Treatment goals for patients with amenorrhea may vary considerably, and depend on the patient and the specific diagnosis.

### Symptomatic hypopituitarism revealing primary suprasellar lymphoma [^117PuRZD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 26 year-old-woman, with a history of infertility for five years (treated by ovulation induction medications), was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of amenorrhea, galactorrhea and neurological disorders. She was well until 6 months before her admission in the neurology department of the University Hospital of Rabat. She developed weakness, headaches associated with nausea and vomiting, shaking chills, night sweats, an 8-pound weight loss and diplopia. Computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the brain showed a hyperdense mass in the suprasellar region (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (T1 and T2 weighted with contrast) revealed an enhancing suprasellar mass (9 × 6 mm) and thickening of pituitary stalk (Figure 2).

Figure 1

Figure 2
MRI of the brain coronal (A) and sagittal (B) T1-weighted images with contrast enhancement, performed at the first presentation showing the suprasellar mass(1) with thickening of pituitary stalk (2).

Laboratory findings showed: microcytic anemia (10 g/dl), hyponatremia (130 mEq/L), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40 mm in first hour) with an increased alpha-2-gobulin in serum protein electrophoresis. An endocrinological evaluation revealed low levels of follicle stimulating hormone (2.5 IU/L; normal ranges in the laboratory 5–20 IU/L) and luteinizing hormone (0.5 IU/L; normal ranges in the laboratory 10–70 IU/L), serum prolactin level was greatly increased (145 ng/ml; normal ranges in the laboratory 2.8–29.2 ng/ml) without dysfunctions of Antidiuretic Hormone. She underwent an extensive biological work-up evaluation including: thyroid function tests, skin testing for tuberculosis; serological tests for HIV, panel hepatitis and syphilis; lumbar puncture and salivary gland biopsy; all were unrevealing. Chest x-ray and abdominal echography were normal.

5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Natazia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

5.7 Headache

If a woman taking Natazia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Natazia if indicated.

An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.

5.8 Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Women who are not pregnant and use Natazia, may experience amenorrhea. Based on patient diaries, amenorrhea occurs in approximately 16% of cycles in women using Natazia. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea occurring in two or more consecutive cycles. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

Based on patient diaries from three clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Natazia for contraception, 10–23% of women experienced intracyclic bleeding per cycle.

5.9 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Natazia discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.

5.10 Interference with Laboratory Tests

The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.11 Monitoring

A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.
