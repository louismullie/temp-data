## Question

27-year-old woman with episodic finger color changes (white to red to blue), fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss; normal cardiorespiratory exam; labs show anti-U1 RNP antibodies and elevated creatine kinase.

A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Answer Choices:
A. Mixed connective tissue disease
B. Polymyositis
C. Systemic sclerosis
D. Rheumatoid arthritis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 27-year-old woman with episodic triphasic finger color changes, fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, and laboratory findings of anti-U1 RNP antibodies and elevated creatine kinase, and wants to determine the most likely diagnosis among mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the triad of Raynaud phenomenon, myositis, and anti-U1 RNP serology. Then, I should verify how each alternative diagnosis fits or fails to fit these features. Next, I will review the pathophysiologic link between anti-U1 RNP and mixed connective tissue disease. Finally, I will consider what additional tests would confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, before concluding with the most likely diagnosis and why the others are less likely.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical clues. The triphasic color change of the fingers from white to blue to red is classic for Raynaud phenomenon, which is a vascular spasm response to cold or stress and is strongly associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease, and can also occur in dermatomyositis and other connective tissue diseases, so I need to keep that broad differential in mind while I anchor on the serology and systemic features [^9711101e].

> Wait, let me verify the serologic anchor. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies are the serologic hallmark of mixed connective tissue disease and are typically present at high titers in this condition, which ties the Raynaud phenomenon and systemic symptoms together in a way that is highly specific for MCTD rather than the other options presented, so this is a strong pivot toward MCTD as the leading diagnosis [^notfound].

> I will now examine how polymyositis fits. Polymyositis explains the proximal muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase, but it does not by itself account for Raynaud phenomenon, and it lacks the characteristic anti-U1 RNP serology of MCTD, so while the myositis piece aligns, the overall pattern is incomplete for polymyositis alone, making it less likely as a standalone diagnosis here [^6318c241].

> Next, I should review systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis fits the Raynaud phenomenon and can include weight loss and fatigue, but the elevated creatine kinase and objective myositis are not expected features of systemic sclerosis, and the absence of sclerodactyly or other scleroderma skin changes in the vignette further weakens that diagnosis despite the Raynaud clue, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute to SSc here [^9711101e].

> Hold on, I should verify rheumatoid arthritis. RA can cause fatigue and weight loss, but it does not explain Raynaud phenomenon and is not associated with anti-U1 RNP antibodies, so RA is the least consistent option with the presented serology and vascular features, making it the least likely choice in this scenario [^6318c241].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Mixed connective tissue disease is defined by overlapping features of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis, with high-titer anti-U1 RNP antibodies driving immune complex–mediated disease that can manifest with Raynaud vasculopathy, inflammatory myositis with CK elevation, and systemic B symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss, which matches this patient's constellation precisely [^6318c241].

> But wait, what if this is an overlap syndrome without MCTD? I should double-check that the presence of anti-U1 RNP in this context is not just a nonspecific ANA pattern. Anti-U1 RNP is highly specific for MCTD and is not a typical feature of isolated polymyositis, SSc, or RA, so the serology plus the clinical triad of Raynaud, myositis, and systemic symptoms strongly supports MCTD rather than a nonspecific overlap or an isolated myositis with incidental Raynaud [^6318c241].

> Next, I should review what additional tests would confirm and stage the disease. I need to check inflammatory markers, a comprehensive myositis antibody panel, pulmonary function testing and high-resolution chest CT given the risk of interstitial lung disease in MCTD, and an echocardiogram to screen for pulmonary hypertension, because MCTD carries risks of ILD and pulmonary vascular disease that change management and prognosis, and these evaluations are standard in suspected MCTD workups [^6318c241].

> Final reasoning: the combination of Raynaud phenomenon, objective myositis with elevated CK, and positive anti-U1 RNP antibodies in a young woman with systemic symptoms is pathognomonic for mixed connective tissue disease, whereas polymyositis lacks the serology and Raynaud, systemic sclerosis lacks the myositis and skin findings here, and rheumatoid arthritis fits neither the vascular nor the serologic features, so the most likely diagnosis is mixed connective tissue disease [^6318c241].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)** [^6318c241], given the triad of Raynaud phenomenon, anti-U1 RNP positivity, and inflammatory myopathy with elevated CK [^notfound]. MCTD uniquely combines features of systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus; the other options either lack the serologic marker or do not explain the full clinical picture. Polymyositis would explain weakness and CK elevation but not Raynaud phenomenon or anti-U1 RNP; systemic sclerosis would explain Raynaud but not myositis; and rheumatoid arthritis does not fit the serology or myositis.

---

## Clinical features and laboratory findings

- **Raynaud phenomenon**: Triphasic color change (white to blue to red) is characteristic of MCTD and reflects vascular spasm and reperfusion [^notfound].

- **Anti-U1 RNP antibodies**: Highly specific for MCTD and present in 95–100% of cases, typically at high titers [^notfound].

- **Elevated creatine kinase (CK)**: Indicates inflammatory myopathy, a core feature of MCTD overlap with polymyositis [^notfound].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, weight loss, and muscle weakness are common in MCTD due to multi-organ involvement [^6318c241].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Key features** | **Compatibility with case** |
|-|-|-|
| Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) | - Raynaud phenomenon <br/> - Anti-U1 RNP antibodies <br/> - Inflammatory myopathy with elevated CK | Highly compatible |
| Polymyositis | - Proximal muscle weakness <br/> - Elevated CK <br/> - No Raynaud phenomenon or anti-U1 RNP | Partially compatible |
| Systemic sclerosis | - Raynaud phenomenon <br/> - Sclerodactyly <br/> - No myositis or anti-U1 RNP | Partially compatible |
| Rheumatoid arthritis | - Joint pain and swelling <br/> - Rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP <br/> - No Raynaud phenomenon or myositis | Not compatible |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)** [^6318c241], given the combination of Raynaud phenomenon, anti-U1 RNP antibodies, and inflammatory myopathy with elevated CK. Confirm with a **comprehensive autoimmune panel**, muscle enzymes, and imaging as indicated, and initiate immunosuppressive therapy to control disease activity and prevent complications [^notfound].

Polymyalgia-like syndrome during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy — clinical features and diagnostic testing include proximal severe myalgia and fatigue resembling polymyalgia rheumatica, often with arthralgia and typically without definite synovitis, though inflammatory arthritis can occur; ultrasound or MRI might show a mild shoulder effusion. Patients have pain but not true weakness; rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody are negative, inflammatory markers are highly elevated, creatine kinase levels should generally be within normal limits, and MRI and EMG should not show evidence of myopathy or muscle inflammation.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient's prognosis and level of functioning remain poor due to ongoing weakness, wasting and pain, which have proven refractory to current immunosuppressive treatment, despite some improvement in her skin disease. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) had been considered; however, the patient declined. Other treatment options such as rituximab and cyclophosphamide were not considered appropriate given her rapid deterioration, stable ILD and the development of infectious complications, including osteomyelitis in her right elbow, left distal third metacarpal and base of proximal phalanx of left middle finger related to infected skin ulcers.

Case presentation

A 77-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 5-month history of multiple erythematous pink to red, ovoid, smooth, thin papules and plaques affecting her chest and upper extremities (Fig 1). The lesions were intermittently pruritic and nontender. Finger and periungual examinations revealed proximal nailfold erythema, periungual telangiectasias, and dilated capillary loops with dropout (Fig 2). A comprehensive skin exam was negative for heliotrope rash, shawl or V-neck erythema, Gottron papule/sign, and calcinosis. She endorsed muscle weakness, arthralgias, dysphagia, and Raynaud's phenomenon of her fingers, sparing the thumbs. In addition, she reported bilateral lower leg and thigh swelling, which coincided with the rash onset, but has since resolved. Notably, she denied shortness of breath. Skin biopsy of the plaque revealed interface vacuolar dermatitis with increased dermal mucin (Fig 3). Laboratory studies were notable for anti-NXP-2 antibody positivity, antinuclear antibody positivity with a reported titer of > 1:1280, and mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40 mm/h). Complement, C-reactive protein, aldolase, and creatine kinase levels were within normal limits. Other myositis-specific antibodies, including anti-Jo-1, anti-PM, anti-PL, anti-Mi-2, and anti-MDA-5, were negative. A thorough musculoskeletal examination by the rheumatology service revealed no objective muscle weakness or joint disease; the patient had normal muscle strength and full range of motion. With these findings, she was ultimately diagnosed with amyopathic NXP-2 DM.

A 65-year-old woman presented with 3 months of progressive hand weakness, initially with distal-predominant symptoms. EMG was notable for diminished amplitudes in bilateral radial nerves without evidence of conduction block and with normal sensory nerve action potentials. Anti-acetylcholine receptor and antistriated muscle antibodies were positive, but subsequent EMG did not reveal abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation. Muscle biopsy was performed, revealing extensive inflammatory infiltrates with significant associated fibrosis. This case discusses the approach to localization within the motor pathway and the use of serologic studies, imaging, and electrodiagnostic testing to supplement history and examination.

Polymyositis (PM) has been in the diagnostic armamentarium in medicine since the mid-nineteenth century. Medicine training puts a heavy emphasis on this diagnosis, and anyone with proximal muscle weakness with elevated serum creatinine kinase is assumed to be PM and a number of patients were rendered this diagnosis without additional testing. This article addresses the historical aspects of the diagnosis of PM and its evolution. We review this literature that addresses the rarity of this diagnosis and rightly puts in perspective in terms of its occurrence in relation to other inflammatory myositides.

Introduction: MCTD is an extremely rare multisystem disease with overlapping features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SSc, SLE, and dermatomyositis, along with the presence of anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies in high titers

Objectives: We report a rare case of MCTD. Identified in an adolescent girl, misdiagnosed since childhood.

Methods: A case report is described

Results: A 21-year-old Libyan girl, born to consanguineous parents, has no family history of note. She came to our attention with skin tightness over the last 2 years associated with contracture of her fingers of both hands (deformity of her fingers), poor appetite, loss of weight of about 22 kg, fatigue, Reynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcers, muscle pain, She also experienced shortness of breath, coughing, and joints pain for the last 2 years. She had a rough clinical course of disease that required her several admissions and was misdiagnosed; the last one was in 2022 because of huge hepatosplenomegaly and ascities for bone marrow that were normal. During the whole of these years, but no one has noticed she has a connective tissue disease. On physical examination she was short for her age, underweight, delayed puberty, Bp = 101/74, tightness of her skin of face (mouth fish appearance), both upper and lower extremities, trunk and back, deformity of her fingers of both hands, huge hepatosplenomegally no ascities. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis microcytic hypochromic anemia, ESR high elevated 137 mm/hr, CRP was positive, GPT 46 little bit elevated but GOT 106 was high elevated, high elevated CPK = 2489 U/L, LDH = 465 U/L, urea = 13 mg/dl, creatinine = 0.4 mg/dl, normal TSH, free T4. Urine analysis demonstrated protein+++, very high urine for protein/creatinine ratio = 6% Immunoprofile: ANA was very elevated (1:5120 titter), positive RF was 31 U/ml, and antidsDNA abs were negative. U1-snRNPab positive with high titter 53 (N < 5); anti-SMab was negative; she was positive for SAA (RO 52, 60) with a high titter > 200 U/ml but antiSSB La abs, Scl70, Jo1, APL abs were negative and normal complement. An echocardiography finding was mild pulmonary hypertension. Renal biopsy revealed vascular nephropathy associated with segmental and focal Hayalin disease of scleroderma. Endoscopy revealed severe oesophageal candidiasis and no oesophageal varices. She was being treated with prednisolone 25 mg, then tapered to 10 mg, MM 500 mg twice daily, Enalapril tab 2.5mg once per day, furosemide tab 20mg once per day, aldoctone tab 25 mg, and plaquenil tab 100 mg once per day. Fluconazol capsule, 150 mg, once a day for 2 weeks. Recently added MTX 10 mg/wk. The disease was partially under control with these medications.

### Muscle biopsy in the evaluation of patients with modestly elevated creatine kinase levels [^6b1de96d]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The utility of muscle biopsy in patients with modest elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK) level but normal neurological examinations and nondiagnostic electrodiagnostic studies is uncertain. We performed systematic, extensive studies on muscle biopsies of 20 such patients. A definitive diagnosis was arrived at in only 1 by histochemical studies, although 4 others demonstrated minor myopathic changes. Biochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis in an additional 5. Muscle biopsy is useful for evaluating such patients, but extensive studies of the muscle are necessary.

### Approach to acute weakness [^fcf9864c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Weakness has a broad differential diagnosis. A paradigm for organizing possibilities is to consider what part of the nervous system is involved, ranging from brain, spinal cord, nerve roots, and peripheral nerves to the neuromuscular junction. The clinician can consider internal versus external causes. Some neurologic conditions have subtle presentations yet carry a risk of short-term decompensation if not recognized. It is helpful to consider whether an emergency department presentation of weakness is a new disease process or represents an exacerbation of an established condition. Emergency presentations of weakness are challenging, and one must carefully consider potential serious causes.

### Clinical and histopathological features of myositis in systemic lupus erythematosus [^7802a44e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Detailed clinical features of patients with SLE myopathy who underwent muscle biopsy

Nineteen muscle biopsies were available for review, majority of which were from women (89.5%) and 14 from African Americans (73.7%). Of these, two had normal creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and no evidence of myopathy on muscle biopsy and therefore did not meet the criteria for lupus myopathy. Additionally, a third biopsy from a 42-year-old African American woman on hydroxychloroquine with history of fatigue, myalgias and subjective muscle weakness showed an accumulation of small acid phosphatase positive vacuoles in otherwise normal myofibres, consistent with hydroxychloroquine myopathy. Therefore, we included only 16 muscle biopsies in our analysis.

The mean maximum CK of the remaining 16 patients undergoing biopsy was elevated at 6240 (SD 6441), and 11 (68.75%) had documented proximal muscle weakness. Twelve patients had an electromyogram and four (33.33%) of these were consistent with non-irritable myopathy, seven (58.33%) had irritable myopathy and one of them was normal. One had electrophysiological findings consistent with a neurogenic process. Eight (50%) of the muscle biopsies were histologically classified as necrotising myopathy and six (38%) were histologically classified as dermatomyositis based on the presence of perifascicular atrophy, the hallmark feature of dermatomyositis (table 4). Regarding individual histological features, 25% had primary inflammation, 87.5% had necrosis and/or regeneration, 25% had perimysial inflammation and 37.5% had endomysial inflammation (table 5). A single biopsy did not reveal any pathological findings, although the EMG demonstrated irritable myopathy and there was elevation of CPK.

Table 4
Demographic features of patients with SLE myopathy and available muscle biopsy (n = 16)

Table 5
Histological features of SLE myopathy muscle biopsies (n = 16)

The vast majority of the patients responded to immunosuppressive treatment and had normal muscle strength at their last visit (73.3%), and only four patients continued to have muscle weakness. Interestingly, a 42-year-old African American woman presented with only weakness of the finger flexors and positive anti-NT5c1A antibodies, which would fit a clinical diagnosis of inclusion body myositis. However, her muscle biopsy was consistent with dermatomyositis and her strength actually improved with immunosuppression.

Introduction

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare inflammatory myopathy shown to disproportionately affect Black individuals, with estimated incidence 3-fold greater than that in White individuals. As with multiple cutaneous diseases in skin of color, specific manifestations of DM in Black patients remain underreported in educational sources and scientific literature, leading to potential misdiagnoses or diagnostic delays.

We present a case study of a 61-year-old Vietnamese woman who presents with features of dermatomyositis (DM), including Gottron's papules, heliotrope rash, cutaneous ulcers, generalised weakness and pain, and weight loss with normal levels of creatine kinase (CK). She demonstrated features of interstitial lung disease and subsequently tested positive for anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 and anti-small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 activating enzyme antibodies, which belong to a DM subtype known as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis and do not present with raised CK. She received standard treatment for DM, including oral prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, mycopheonlate and topical betamethasone. The treatment successfully reversed skin changes; however, the patient remained generally weak and unable to carry out her activities of daily living.

### A 47-year old woman with rapidly progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure [^a85ecf01]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 47-year-old Hispanic woman presented to a pulmonology clinic with 2 weeks of cough productive of white sputum and worsening dyspnea on exertion, requiring increasing supplemental oxygen. In addition, she reported fatigue, night sweats, diffuse myalgias, and extremity weakness. She denied hemoptysis, fevers, chills, weight loss, or rash. Her medical history is significant for undifferentiated rapidly progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure 2 years before her current presentation. At that time, she presented to the ED with 3 weeks of progressive shortness of breath and cough. Chest CT imaging showed bilateral infiltrates concerning for infection, and she was treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. She developed worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure despite broadening of her antibiotics and subsequently required intubation. Her course was further complicated by pulseless electrical activity arrest with return of spontaneous circulation and development of shock requiring multiple vasopressors. Because of difficulty with oxygenation, she was referred to our center for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation evaluation and was ultimately started on venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Bronchoscopy with BAL was negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal origins, and initial autoimmune evaluation (antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor) was negative, except an elevated creatine kinase (CK) to 3,000. Her course was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and as a result she suffered limb ischemia requiring amputation of her left lower extremity. Elevated CK at that time was attributed to compartment syndrome before amputation. The patient recovered clinically with supportive care and was ultimately discharged on 2 L supplemental oxygen, with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure of unclear origin. The patient had stability in her clinical symptoms until this current presentation.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^71039379]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

According to guidelines, glucocorticoids with an initial dose (prednisone equivalent) of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, combined with azathioprine or methotrexate, are sufficient in most cases on the new diagnosis of DM. As other cases with severe clinical courses benefitted from high-dose glucocorticoid regimens, we opted for the same approach, which later necessitated a second-line therapy with IVIG due to symptom exacerbation under first-line therapy.

Learning points

In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a comprehensive clinical evaluation — including diagnostic investigations such as laboratory parameters and antibody profiling — is essential for accurate diagnosis.
Both clinical and laboratory findings can provide valuable insights into the risk of an underlying malignancy.
Cancer screening should be guided by risk stratification to avoid missing a malignancy and to ensure appropriate causal treatment.
A thorough search for rarely associated malignancies is warranted.

Case presentation

A 61-year-old Vietnamese woman presented in February 2019 with a 4-month history of a violaceous, erythematous rash with scaling on her arms, thighs, scalp and face, weight loss from 54 kg down to 38 kg, and associated arthralgias and weakness resulting in falls and need for a walker to mobilise. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (875 mg/125 mg) by her general practitioner 3 weeks prior to presentation for skin infections due to persistent scratching. There was no history of any fevers, rigours, travel or sick contacts. There was a vague history of exertional dyspnoea but no chest pains, palpitations or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac failure.

Her medical history was significant for a 16-year history of Graves disease (requiring a total thyroidectomy in 2004), diverticulosis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia with chronic back pain and depression. There was no known history of malignancy. Her medications on admission included amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (875 mg/125 mg), thyroxine 100 µg daily, amitriptyline 35 mg at night, paracetamol with codeine (500 mg/30 mg) one tablet three times a day as needed and fenofibrate 145 mg/day (patient self-commenced 1 week prior to admission following it being prescribed 1 year ago but never commenced). There was no known statin use. She did not smoke, drank minimal alcohol, lived with her two daughters, and prior to onset of her illness was independent with all activities and instrumental activities of daily living.

On examination, all her vital observations were normal. She appeared severely malnourished and weighed 38 kg. She had a diffuse pruritic rash over her upper limbs and lower limbs, with ulcers and Gottron's papules over her hands, which were painful to touch (figure 1). There were ragged cuticles and proximal nail fold erythema, but no sclerodactyly. There was a heliotrope rash with periorbital swelling in addition to a diffuse erythematous rash with violaceous patches with overlying scale and hyperpigmentation. There was diffuse tenderness over most of her joints but no joint effusions. She had generalised weakness in all limbs with significant upper and lower limb muscle wasting and normal tone and reflexes. Bi-basal fine crackles were heard on lung auscultation but heart sounds were dual without murmurs. The abdominal examination was normal.

### Pseudohypoglycemia: a cause for unreliable finger-stick glucose measurements [^9eacd238]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify patients with an inaccurate diagnosis of hypoglycemia and discuss predisposing factors.

Methods

We describe our patient's clinical presentation, laboratory work-up, hospital course, and follow-up and review similar cases from the literature.

Results

A 27-year-old woman with Raynaud phenomenon was admitted because of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Physical examination showed tremulousness, sweating, and the classic Raynaud color changes of the hands during episodic symptoms. A 72-hour fast revealed finger-stick capillary glucose values ranging from 32 to 45 mg/dL on multiple occasions, while concurrent plasma glucose values were consistently 1.5 to 2 times higher. Capillary measurements of glucose performed in the arms and legs at room temperature and after warming of each extremity disclosed an increase in glucose levels from a range of 35 to 52 mg/dL at room temperature to a range of 82 to 100 mg/dL after warming, confirming a discordance between capillary and venous blood results. The diagnosis of pseudohypoglycemia was made. Pseudohypoglycemia has been reported in patients with Raynaud phenomenon, peripheral vascular disease, and shock and may result from increased glucose extraction by the tissues because of low capillary flow and increased glucose transit time.

Conclusion

Pseudohypoglycemia should be suspected in the setting of impaired microcirculation and can be confirmed by readily available means.

A 61-year-old woman presented with a life long history of fatigability which worsened on exertion. She became fearful of exercising and thus was labelled as "lazy" by family and friends. After being started on simvastatin she was found to have raised creatine kinase (CK) values, which remained elevated despite stopping the drug. On the basis of the history, McArdle disease was suspected and a muscle biopsy confirmed it.

### Multiple malignancy-associated dermatomyositis myositis-specific autoantibodies in dermatomyositis [^12d67f09]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest Narayan and Richardson's report of dermatomyositis (DM) with multiple myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs), including anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-γ (TIF1-γ), SUMO-activating enzyme, and nuclear helicase protein-2. Other known dermatomyositis-specific MSAs (DM-MSAs) include anti-nuclear matrix protein-2 (NXP-2) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5). Multiple DM-MSAs are uncommon, with an estimated prevalence of 15.7% among MSA-positive patients. Herein, we present a DM patient with TIF1-γ, MDA-5, and NXP-2 autoantibodies.

A 30-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a heliotrope rash (Fig 1, A), Gottron sign (Fig 1, B), V-neck erythema (Fig 1, C), hypopigmented, red-on-white patches (Fig 1, C and D), and muscle weakness. Laboratory studies revealed elevated creatine kinase (11,484; normal range, 5–150 U/L) and aldolase (29.4; normal range, 3.3–10.3 U/L). The extranuclear antigen antibody panel showed antiribonucleoprotein positivity. The Myomarker 3 Panel was also positive for anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase, TIF1-γ, MDA-5, NXP-2, U1-ribonucleoprotein, and Sjögren-syndrome-related antigen A 52 antibodies. A punch biopsy revealed perivascular and interstitial dermatitis with interface changes and pigment-laden macrophages (Fig 2, A-C). Malignancy and interstitial lung disease screenings were unremarkable.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy: barriers to prompt recognition [^b21d0992]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) myopathy is an immune-mediated necrotising myopathy. Atypical presentations hinder its recognition and its prompt treatment. We present two patients with atypical clinical or pathological features. A 45-year-old woman had an asymptomatic serum creatine kinase (CK) of ~10000IU/L and muscle biopsy showing minimal changes. She then developed slowly progressive proximal weakness, diagnosed as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy but with negative genetics. Twelve years later, now with severe proximal weakness, her MR scan of muscle showed diffuse asymmetrical fatty degeneration, with conspicuous hyperintense STIR signal abnormalities. HMGCR antibodies were positive and she partially improved with immunosuppression. The second patient developed slowly progressive proximal limb weakness with a high serum CK (~4000IU/L); muscle biopsy showed a lymphocyte infiltrate with angiocentric distribution suggesting vasculitis. Serum HMGCR antibodies were positive. Anti-HMGCR myopathy can present as a slowly progressive myopathy with atypical pathology. HMGCR antibody screening is indicated for people with suspected limb-girdle muscular dystrophy or atypical inflammatory muscle conditions.

Clinical reports

Family 1

Patient III:1 in Family 1 was a 27-year-old male and first child of consanguineous healthy parents (first degree cousins) of Lebanese ancestry. Since childhood, he has had thin muscles especially affecting the lower legs without apparent weakness. Between 20 and 24 years of age, he had experienced episodic muscle pain, weakness and fatigue. These episodes were most evident in his arms and legs in the beginning of the day, lasting from one month to several months and without any apparent triggering or associated factors. Neurological examination at age 27 revealed no muscle weakness, but the lower legs were thin, the medial parts of the gastrocnemius muscles were atrophic (Fig. 1). He had a wide neck, anteverted shoulders, prominent trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles and a tendency to thoracic kyphosis. He had slight shortening of the Achilles tendons, and slight contractures of his long finger flexors. Slight syndactyly was observed between fingers and a tendency to sandal gap widening between the first and second toe. EMG of the vastus lateralis was borderline myopathic as found on the turns amplitude analysis of the interference pattern. EMG was normal in the deltoid muscle and the interosseus dorsi muscles of the hands. At age 20 years, he was examined because of recurrent sharp chest pains. His ECG showed Q waves in aVL, I and aVR, T-inversions in aVF and III and increased QRS amplitudes in the chest leads, suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy. A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was prematurely terminated due to leg fatigue and showed reduced exercise capacity, 192 W, 70% of the reference value. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were normal. A cardiac MRI (CMR) at age 27 showed increased basal wall thickness (30 mm) consistent with hypertrophy and a small ventricular diverticulum, but otherwise adequate systolic ventricular performance and normal valvular function. There were no signs of atrial abnormalities.

### Erythromelalgia associated with dermatomyositis: a case series [^256fde2e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Because erythromelalgia is a clinical diagnosis, the diagnosis cannot be made with complete certainty; however, the clinical history, age of onset, and appearance of the hands and feet in these cases support a diagnosis of secondary erythromelalgia. The temporal association with the underlying disease may vary, as has been seen in erythromelalgia secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus as well(in case 1, the onset of the erythromelalgia preceded the dermatomyositis rash by approximately 20 years; in case 2, the dermatomyositis rash preceded the erythromelalgia by 1 week).

### Red knuckles… [^21559260]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of erythematous patches on her hands, chest, and upper back. She recently began having difficulty lifting her arms to brush her hair and climbing stairs. Question. Discussion The answer is E: dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease that causes characteristic skin changes as well as progressive, proximal muscle weakness. The average age of onset in adult patients is 40 years, but DM also can affect children and younger adults. It is more common in women and those with connective tissue diseases. It may be associated with a malignancy, particularly in patients who are 55 years or older. The exact etiology of this disease is unknown, but an autoimmune cause is likely because of the presence of certain autoanti-bodies seen in patients with DM.

1. The clinical presentation consists of skin findings and muscle weakness.

The pathognomonic skin manifestation occurring in 70 percent of patients is the presence of erythematous patches on the skin overlying the dorsal surface of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, the knees and elbows, known as Gottron's papules. A less common but classic skin manifestation is the purplish-red heliotrope eruption on the eyelids with periorbital edema, which occurs in 30 to 60 percent of patients with DM. Large confluent areas of erythema over the upper chest, back, and shoulders — known as the "shawl" sign — may be seen, as in this patient. Periungual telangiectasias and generalized erythema on sun-exposed skin also occur with DM. The signs of muscle involvement include progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness, and weakness of the pharyngeal and tongue muscles. Proximal muscle weakness is manifested by difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a seated position, or raising the arms overhead.

It is not uncommon for the myositis to lead to serious complications if it affects the diaphragm, accessory respiratory muscles, or cardiac muscle. The pharyngeal muscle weakness may lead to dysphagia, aspiration, and respiratory tract infections. Progressive pulmonary fibrosis occurs in 10 percent of patients and, along with myositis of the respiratory muscles, may lead to hypoxemia. Cardiomyopathy may cause arrhythmias or heart failure. These complications are the major causes of mortality in patients with DM. 1 The clinical presentation, enzyme elevations, electromyographic abnormalities, and the presence of myositis-associated autoantibodies are helpful tools in the diagnosis of DM. In DM, the amount of creatine kinase MM subtype fluctuates with disease activity. Patients with DM may respond well to steroid treatment, and it is the first line of therapy.

If muscle strength does not improve after several months of steroid treatment, other immunosuppressants may be considered, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine. Porphyria cutanea tarda presents as bullae, vesicles, and milia on the dorsal hands and forearms but does not cause muscle weakness. In scleroderma, the fingers become tapered over time. The skin is tight and smooth without erythematous patches. Systemic lupus erythematosus may cause erythematous patches on the face or dorsal fingers, but the skin involvement is usually between the joints, rather than on top of the joints as in DM. Arthralgias, not muscle weakness, are the most common musculoskeletal complaint in lupus. Polymyositis does lead to proximal muscle weakness, but it does not have the skin findings found in DM.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^578f111e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of Cushing's syndrome — discriminatory signs versus common features are summarized: Few, if any, features of Cushing's syndrome are unique, but some are more discriminatory than others, including reddish purple striae, plethora, proximal muscle weakness, bruising with no obvious trauma, and unexplainable osteoporosis. Table 1 lists features that best discriminate Cushing's syndrome; most do not have a high sensitivity, including easy bruising, facial plethora, proximal myopathy (or proximal muscle weakness), and striae (especially if reddish purple and > 1 cm wide), with in children, weight gain with decreasing growth velocity. It also lists Cushing's syndrome features in the general population that are common and/or less discriminatory and overlapping conditions, including symptoms such as depression, fatigue, weight gain, and menstrual abnormalities, and conditions such as hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, vertebral osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypokalemia, kidney stones, incidental adrenal mass, and unusual infections; features marked b indicate Cushing's syndrome is more likely if onset is at a younger age. We encourage caregivers to consider Cushing's syndrome as a secondary cause of these conditions, particularly if additional features of the disorder are present.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy presenting with acute systolic heart failure [^172028d4]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) is an immune-mediated myopathy that may be associated with statin use, malignancy or an autoimmune connective tissue disease, but it can also be idiopathic. Anti-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) myopathy is an extremely rare side effect of statin use, occurring in approximately 2–3 out of every 100000 patients who use statins. Patients typically present with subacute proximal muscle weakness and creatine kinase levels > 10 times the upper limit of normal. The diagnosis is suggested by muscle biopsy showing necrotic fibres with minimal inflammation along with positive anti-HMGCR antibodies. Treatment nearly always requires multiple immunosuppressive agents, the earlier use of which is associated with improved outcomes. Reports of statin-induced NAM leading to heart failure are limited. We present the case of a 69-year-old woman with statin-induced NAM who presented with acute systolic heart failure. Early initiation of high-dose corticosteroids and IVIG resulted in significant improvement in her symptoms.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^906cf560]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

Over the course of 6 to 8 weeks of therapy, the effectiveness of the treatment is clinically observed for improved muscle strength and cutaneous symptom alleviation. Typically, a decrease in Creatine kinase levels is first observed throughout the healing process, followed by a more gradual return of muscle strength. The prednisone dose can be reduced once clinical improvement is seen. In connecting the patient's history with clinical indicators, our case study emphasises the importance of clinical judgement. A multidisciplinary strategy combining family doctors, rheumatologists, dermatologists, and medical oncologists is crucial for the management of JDM.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: managing cholesterol in a patient with statin intolerance due to anti-HMG-CoA reductase-associated myopathy [^6f4a61ed]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statins are the first line of treatment for hypercholesterolemia and of prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). It is estimated that 1 in 4 Americans over the age of 40 years use statins. In rare cases, patients may develop an autoimmune myopathy associated with antibodies against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). Anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy requires immediate discontinuation of statins plus initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Suspension of statin treatment worsens low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) control, leading to an increased risk of ASCVD and necessitating commencement of another treatment for dyslipidemia. Unfortunately, the management of dyslipidemia in these patients is still unclear. In this study, we describe the case of a 65-year-old woman with dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin, who consulted for long-standing muscle pain associated with symmetrical proximal weakness. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of creatine kinase and anti-HMGCR antibodies. She was diagnosed with an anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy and was successfully treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine as immunosuppressive therapy, followed by ezetimibe for LDL-C reduction. We present key findings for early recognition and treatment of anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy and give recommendations on how to manage hypercholesterolemia in a patient with statin intolerance due to this disease.

Case presentation

A 54-year-old previously healthy Caucasian man was referred to our rheumatology clinic with a 3-month history of Raynaud's phenomenon affecting the hands and feet. He also described arthralgia affecting the small joints of the hands, as well as a dry cough and fatigue. System review was notable for an influenza-like illness prior to the onset of his symptoms. He also had a long-standing facial rash, which he reported was intermittently present and responded to topical steroids.

He had no significant medical history or surgical history, and he took no regular or over-the-counter medications. His mother had asthma and hypothyroidism. His sister also had hypothyroidism, while his brother was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 45. He was an ex-smoker with a 20-pack-year history, and he drank 14 units of alcohol per week. He denied any intravenous drug use.

On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. Triphasic colour change of Raynaud's was noted in the hands. There was also 'puffiness' of the fingers and dorsum of the hand but no clear sclerodactyly. There was no focal tenderness, digital ulcers or synovitis. There was no focal weakness apart from decreased grip strength. Cardiorespiratory, abdominal, neurological and thyroid exam were unremarkable.

Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism — Common manifestations include dry skin, cold sensitivity, fatigue, muscle cramps, voice changes, and constipation, while severe disease may present with carpal tunnel syndrome, sleep apnea, pituitary hyperplasia with or without hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea, and hyponatremia within several weeks of profound hypothyroidism. Rating scales have been used but have low sensitivity and specificity; the degree of hypothyroidism correlates with ankle reflex relaxation time. Return to a euthyroid state is supported by normalization of resting heart rate, serum cholesterol, anxiety level, sleep pattern, and menstrual cycle abnormalities including menorrhagia, as well as normalization of elevated serum creatine kinase or other muscle or hepatic enzymes following treatment.

### Late-onset immunotherapy toxicity and delayed autoantibody changes: checkpoint inhibitor-induced Raynaud' s-like phenomenon [^18f6e635]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 53‐year‐old woman with a 35 pack‐year smoking history developed progressive mid‐back pain. She was found to have a paraspinal mass, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a dominant 1.7‐cm right lower lobe mass. Biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary, harboring a KRAS G12C mutation. The patient had no history of autoimmune disease. She initiated combination ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 6 weeks and nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks and was transitioned to nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks as consolidation therapy after 28 months.

After 4 months of therapy, she developed weakness, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension. Laboratory assessment revealed low serum concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (< 5 pg/mL) and cortisol (0.8 μ/dL). She was diagnosed with hypophysitis featuring secondary adrenal insufficiency. She improved with hydrocortisone.

After 22 months, she noted an abnormal, painful cold sensation in her fingers and toes, which turned white upon cold exposure and then red upon rewarming (Fig. 1). She was diagnosed with Raynaud's‐like phenomenon, which improved with behavior modification and treatment with calcium channel blockers.

### Rapidly progressive fatal interstitial lung disease in a patient with systemic sclerosis [^af0f5775]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 36-year-old woman developed new-onset Raynaud phenomenon and rapidly progressive dyspnea over a 2-week period. A lung biopsy demonstrated pauci-inflammatory nonspecific pneumonitis, which proved refractory to systemic corticosteroid and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy. Her preterminal course in an intensive care unit was typified by sequential organ failure. Postmortem examination showed extensive organ fibrosis, including severe diffuse alveolar damage and parenchymal fibrosis, and a notable lack of potentially treatable tissue inflammation.

Investigations

Chest radiography, physical examination, screening for autoantibodies, measurement of serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, and brain natriuretic peptide levels, cardiac examination, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiography, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, right heart catheterization, high-resolution thoracic CT, pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan, lung biopsy.

Diagnosis

Interstitial lung disease associated with diffuse systemic sclerosis.

Management

Treatment with oxygen, oral and intravenous corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous cyclophosphamide.

### Case report: a COVID-19 patient presenting with mild rhabdomyolysis [^c1137784]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

The news was reported from the Wuhan region of China about a novel corona virus in the end of 2019. After spreading around the world, a pandemic was declared by the WHO. Depending on the different involvement of the disease, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.

### An unexpected cause of proximal myopathy [^acedae63]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 25-year-old man presented with a short history of profound proximal muscle weakness such that he was unable to stand. Laboratory investigations demonstrated hypokalaemia and mildly elevated serum creatine kinase. He reported a history of 8–10 episodes of less severe weakness in the preceding 8 years and his mother reported similar symptoms. The combination of weakness and hypokalaemia with a probable family history suggested the diagnosis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. He was treated with intravenous and oral potassium supplementation, and regained full power within 24 h.

### Clinical reasoning: a 60-year-old woman with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis [^a2d98011]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical assessment of patients with proximal muscle weakness represents a frequent yet intricate challenge. We present the case of a 60-year-old woman who experienced a progressive, symmetrical weakness in proximal limbs and bulbar muscles over 6 months. Notable clinical findings included bilateral ophthalmoparesis; widespread muscle atrophy; and pronounced weakness in craniobulbar, cervical, and proximal muscles, more severe than in distal ones. We elucidate a methodical diagnostic approach, focusing on constructing a comprehensive differential diagnosis and identifying potential causes of proximal muscle weakness. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the etiologies in cases presenting with both progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis. We further describe the role of muscle biopsy results and their integration with genetic testing outcomes.

### 42-year-old man with discoid lupus and progressive weakness [^0b1c3f34]. Brain Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old man presented with three months of progressive proximal weakness, a thirty pound weight loss, and dysphagia. He was hospitalized two months earlier for ventilatory failure requiring five days of mechanical ventilation. His history also included long-term hydroxychloroquine therapy for discoid lupus and a recently elevated total creatine kinase. An electromyogram revealed evidence of an irritable myopathy. Microscopic examination of a muscle biopsy specimen revealed vacuolar myopathy with lysosomal activation. Electron microscopy demonstrated curvilinear inclusions that, given his history, were diagnostic of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) myopathy. Although HCQ myopathy typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and normal-to-mildly-elevated creatine kinase levels, this is one of the few reported cases of ventilatory failure due to HCQ myopathy. Hydroxychloroquine myopathy may be more common than previously reported and should be considered in patients on long term therapy presenting with weakness or ventilatory failure. In these cases, muscle biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old Chinese female with no significant past medical history presented with one-day history of low-grade fever and cough. She also complained of painful swelling of fingers for 3 weeks. Physical examination revealed dactylitis of all fingers, arthritis of both wrists, papules over palmar surface of fingers and small ulcers over interphalangeal joints, periungual regions and finger pulps (Fig. 1). There was hyperpigmentation over the dorsal surface of interphalangeal joints, but no definite Gottron's papules. Nailfold microhemorrhage was seen using a handheld dermatoscope. She also had erythematous plaques over the neck. She had no muscle weakness. The laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) at 64 U/L (normal range 8–24 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 360 U/L (normal range 130–250 U/L). Creatine kinase (CK) level was normal at 129 U/L (normal range 37–173 U/L). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody was positive with a titer of 1:160 with speckled pattern. Rheumatoid factor was positive at 37 units (positive: > 9 units). Anti-extractable nuclear antibody (anti-ENA) panel revealed positive anti-Ro52 antibody. Other autoantibodies studied including anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1, anti-double stranded DNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative. Her chest radiograph showed left perihilar opacity. Although her younger brother was admitted on the same day with mycoplasma pneumonia, her sputum was negative for bacteria including mycoplasma. She was treated for pneumonia and arthritis before being discharged with a course of amoxicillin/clavulanate and naproxen.

### Fatigue in rheumatologic diseases [^0a0250b1]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Today, fatigue still remains an under-reported symptom in rheumatologic diseases, infrequently addressed by patient and physician. Although not all of the causes of fatigue in rheumatologic diseases have been fully elucidated, recognizing the multifactorial components is essential in formulating targeted, effective treatment strategies. Deconstructing rheumatologic diseases into discrete symptoms such as fatigue in an effort to identify specific causes and formulate targeted treatments remains a daunting task. High-quality RCTs will be required to evaluate the effectiveness of combined pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, which empirically appear to be the most promising. To date, this research is lacking.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^19c68980]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.4 Skeletal Muscle

Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of myopathy. Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of rhabdomyolysis, usually in patients with impaired renal function. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed.

5.5 Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

### Efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment in a systemic lupus erythematosus patient presenting with inclusion body myositis [^749b9608]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an inflammatory myopathy that is generally unresponsive to immunosuppressive drugs. The coexistence of IBM with other autoimmune connective tissue diseases is rare. We present a case of a 76-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed proximal muscle weakness of lower extremities and mild elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) at 495 U/L. Muscle biopsy showed changes of endomysial inflammation and rimmed vacuoles consistent with IBM. She was treated with prednisone 40 mg daily and methotrexate 12.5 mg weekly. One month later, her physical examination showed minimal proximal weakness of lower extremities. CK levels decreased to 44 U/L. Prednisone dose was gradually decreased to 5.0 mg daily. She remained stable with normal CK levels during a follow-up period of 10 months. This case, together with other reports, suggests that IBM in the setting of SLE represents a different subtype that can benefit from immunosuppressive treatment.

### Contractures and muscle disease [^54d0ff9b]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Contractures are one of a handful of signs in muscle disease, besides weakness and its distribution, whose presence can help guide us diagnostically, a welcome star on the horizon. Contractures are associated with several myopathies, some with important cardiac manifestations, and consequently are important to recognise; their presence may also provide us with a potential satisfying 'penny dropping' diagnostic moment.

### Translating pre-clinical studies into the clinic: assays and endpoints selected to determine efficacy [^b295dd14]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

A fundamental goal of cancer research is to translate pre-clinical findings into advances in clinical disease management. In preclinical investigations of anticancer therapeutics, the choices of the model, assay, and endpoint selected are critical in this process. If the model or assay are poorly chosen or the data inappropriately analyzed, preclinical findings can lead to inadequate conclusions that can negatively impact the ability to translate findings from the laboratory to the clinic. The present review discusses the pros and cons of preclinical models, assays, and endpoints commonly used in cancer therapeutic assessment evaluations.

### Supplementary search methods versus bibliographic database searching to identify studies and study reports [^52bbb845]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

How these methods might work

Supplementary search methods have different mechanisms of action compared to bibliographic databases, and, thus, 'search' for studies in different ways. Where the mechanism of action in a bibliographic database relies on searching controlled indexing and free‐text fields, supplementary methods might locate studies or study reports in different ways.

For instance, in contacting study authors, the 'search' constitutes dialogue and discussion with authors rather than query formulation in bibliographic databases. For complex reviews, explaining to a topic expert the type of study that you are searching for and why (the dialogue), might be more effective and efficient than formulating search strategies for multiple bibliographic databases and processing the search results. Moreover, it might yield studies or data in different formats, not accessible in bibliographic databases.

In citation searching or reference checking, the 'search' is for links between publications (or authors) rather than a search based on free‐text keywords or controlled indexing (as is used to search bibliographic databases). A citation search can identify studies or reports which have yet to be indexed in bibliographic databases, may have been missed in bibliographic searching due to mis‐indexing, lack of indexing, or missed keywords, and it may locate unpublished or more complete versions of study reports.

In short, supplementary search methods may complement the primary search of a bibliographic database, but questions about the overall effectiveness and resource use of the different methods remain.

Why it is important to do this review

This will be the first Cochrane review to identify and assess up‐to‐date evidence for all the supplementary search methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (hereafter referred to as the Cochrane Handbook). Although two previous Cochrane reviews evaluated two specific supplementary search methods (handsearching and checking references), these reviews are dated and have not been maintained. In addition, the search methods we will assess have evolved over time, underlining the need for a rigorous, comprehensive, and current review.

The review is intended to support researchers in selecting supplementary search methods for use alongside bibliographic database searching. Where possible, we will summarise the evidence on resource use by method, to guide planning of the study identification phase in a systematic review.

### Erythromelalgia associated with dermatomyositis: a case series [^6e7f4a76]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 60-year-old woman with a history of acid reflux presented to the outpatient dermatology clinic because of a rash. She had pink papules on a background of erythema on the extensor metacarpal joints, nailfold telangiectasias, erythematous patches on the lateral aspect of the thighs, the upper chest, the upper back, and the face, and scalp alopecia (Fig 3). She also had edematous, violaceous hands and feet that she reported were painful and associated with tingling. Redness and swelling of the hands and feet started 1 month after the onset of the rash and progressed over the next several months, especially during the summer. The erythema and swelling was exacerbated by heat and exertion and only minimally improved with cool water exposure. She had to increase her shoe size and could not wear her wedding rings. Additionally, she reported muscle weakness in her proximal arms and hip flexors that started 1 week before the rash; on presentation, she had objective muscle weakness to strength testing. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging and electromyography were not performed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Laboratory testing showed creatine phosphokinase 209 U/L (upper limit of normal 182), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 44 (upper limit of normal 40), negative myositis antibodies, and negative antinuclear, anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen A/Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen B, anti-Smith, and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies. Skin biopsy of the thigh showed vacuolar interface dermatitis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition, consistent with dermatomyositis (Fig 4). The malignancy workup was negative. She was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day and intermittent prednisone. Her rash persisted, and she was started on methotrexate titrated to 20 mg/week, with some overall improvement in rash, muscle symptoms, and hand and foot erythema and swelling.

### Antibodies to AChR, MuSK and VGKC in a patient with myasthenia gravis and morvan's syndrome [^8e7898d9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 46-year-old woman presented to a local hospital with acute respiratory failure and a 2-year progressive history of fatigue, personality changes, increased sweating, dysphagia with substantial weight loss, dysarthria, and intermittent ptosis and diplopia. Neurological examination showed facial weakness, lingual atrophy and bulbar palsy, which necessitated the use of a feeding tube and ventilatory support. Mild limb weakness with severe muscle atrophy and diffuse muscle twitches were observed. The patient had also developed visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions. Her personal and family medical histories were unremarkable.

Investigations

Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, repetitive nerve stimulation, electromyogram, blood-cell counts, general chemistry and metabolic function tests, a CT scan, an [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scan, and tests for serum antibodies to acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, voltage-gated potassium channels, P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and paraneoplastic antigens, were carried out.

Diagnosis

Myasthenia gravis associated with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and Morvan's syndrome associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels in the absence of thymoma.

Management

Combined treatment with prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, ciclosporin, and rituximab.

### Myopathy with antibodies to the signal recognition particle: clinical and pathological features [^6d88c81d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study myopathies with serum antibodies to the signal recognition particle (SRP), an unusual, myositis specific antibody associated syndrome that has not been well characterised pathologically.

Methods

Clinical, laboratory, and myopathological features were evaluated in seven consecutive patients with a myopathy and serum anti-SRP antibodies, identified over three years. The anti-SRP myopathy was compared with myopathology in other types of inflammatory and immune myopathies.

Results

The patients with anti-SRP antibodies developed weakness at ages ranging from 32 to 70 years. Onset was seasonal (August to January). Weakness became severe and disability developed rapidly over a period of months. Muscle pain and fatigue were present in some patients. No patient had a dermatomyositis-like rash. Serum creatine kinase was very high (3000 to 25 000 IU/l). Muscle biopsies showed an active myopathy, including muscle fibre necrosis and regeneration. There was prominent endomysial fibrosis, but little or no inflammation. Endomysial capillaries were enlarged, reduced in number, and associated with deposits of the terminal components of complement (C5b-9, membrane attack complex). Strength improved in several patients after corticosteroid treatment.

Conclusions

Myopathies associated with anti-SRP antibodies may produce severe and rapidly progressive weakness and disability. Muscle biopsies show active myopathy with pathological changes in endomysial capillaries but little inflammation. Corticosteroid treatment early in the course of the illness is often followed by improvement in strength. In patients with rapidly progressive myopathies and a high serum creatine kinase but little inflammation on muscle biopsy, measurement of anti-SRP antibodies and pathological examination of muscle, including evaluation of endomysial capillaries, may provide useful information on diagnosis and treatment.

### Beyond T cell toxicity-intrathecal chemokine CXCL13 indicating B cell involvement in immune-related adverse events following checkpoint inhibition: a two-case series and literature review [^668ac7c6]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Twenty‐one days later, she reported new onset of double vision, rapidly evolving fatigue, and ascending muscular and generalized weakness without myalgia. Neurological examination revealed incomplete bilateral horizontal gaze palsy. Laboratory findings showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (27 cells/μL, normal range = 0–4), with predominant activated mononuclear cells and highly elevated CXCL13 levels (316 pg/mL, normal range < 20 pg/mL). The blood–CSF barrier was intact, and there was no evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Serologic testing (CSF and serum) for common herpes viruses and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in CSF showed no evidence of viral activity. In blood, troponin (589 ng/L, normal range = 0–14 ng/L), creatine phosphokinase (CPK; 5826 UI/L; normal range = 38–174 UI/L), and liver enzymes (glutamate pyruvate transaminase: 200 U/L, normal range = 10–50 U/L; glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase: 291 U/L, normal range = 10–50 U/L) were elevated. Markers of systemic inflammation (C‐reactive protein, white blood cell count) were normal. Autoantibody screening furthermore revealed anti‐skeletal muscle reactivity, which was positive for anti‐acetylcholine receptor (anti‐AChR; 4.88 nmol/L, normal range < 0.5) and striatal antititin antibodies (strong positive), and anti‐dense fine speckled 70 kDA molecular weight antibodies. All other autoantibodies of the Euroline paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (−12 Ag) immunoblot (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany) were negative, as were myositis‐specific antibodies (Euroline myositis profile −16 Ag; EUROIMMUN). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 12‐lead electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were normal. Electromyography of the rectus femoris muscle showed pathological spontaneous activity indicative for myositic changes.

### Lovastatin (Altoprev) [^a54262c4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMGCoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue Altoprev if IMNM is suspected.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have occurred with Altoprev [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1.9% of patients receiving Altoprev in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with Altoprev. There have been rare post marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including Altoprev.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.

Consider liver enzyme testing before Altoprev initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Altoprev is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue Altoprev.

5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including Altoprev. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.

### Anti-HMGCR positive immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with associated neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis: a case report [^c1b90b3e]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A previously healthy 36-year-old African American woman presented for evaluation of a painful and burning rash involving her bilateral malar cheeks, chin, and chest for about 8 months duration. A few months prior to the development of this rash, she was noted to have elevated liver enzymes of unknown etiology. She then progressed to develop severe proximal muscle weakness hindering her ability to perform activities of daily life prompting further investigation.

Physical examination revealed flesh-colored to erythematous papules involving the bilateral malar cheeks extending along the jawline to the chin, as well as erythematous papules coalescing into a plaque in the center of her chest (Fig 1). She denied any associated photosensitivity, recent infections, changes in medications, or vaccinations. A punch biopsy was obtained from the chest which revealed perivascular and interstitial neutrophilic inflammation with neutrophilic epitheliotropism, karyorrhexis, and dermal edema, consistent with neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis (Fig 2). Accompanying direct immunofluorescence was negative.

Neutrophilic epitheliotropism, as well as perivascular and interstitial neutrophils with karyorrhectic debris, is seen. A, Hematoxylin and eosin stain; 20× digital zoom; B, Hematoxylin and eosin stain; 32× digital zoom.

Laboratory evaluation revealed significantly elevated creatine kinase to 11, 575 U/L (26–192 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and liver function tests. Serum anti-HMGCR antibody levels were elevated to 474 CU (normal < 20.0 CU). Anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies, myomarker panel, monoclonal gammopathy screen, hepatitis serology, HIV, antinuclear antibody, and extractable nuclear antigens were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated patchy fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the upper and lower extremity proximal muscles consistent with myositis. Electromyography showed evidence of a severe diffuse myopathy with frequent fibrillation, indicating the presence of muscle necrosis. Together, this was consistent with the diagnosis of anti-HMGCR positive IMNM. Muscle biopsy was deferred as there was sufficient evidence to support the diagnosis and to prevent further delay of treatment initiation.

### Dermatomyositis associated with an adrenal adenoma [^593d01aa]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 71-year-old Puerto Rican woman presented with a 2-year history of a waxing and waning pruritic, burning rash that started on her chest and subsequently spread to her back, arms, and face. She did not experience muscle pain or weakness. Her past medical history included hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was taking omeprazole, verapamil, fexofenadine, and occasional ibuprofen. She had no known family history of malignancies or autoimmune conditions.

Her skin examination demonstrated violaceous erythema of the forehead and upper eyelids. She had diffuse pink-red patches and plaques on the dorsal surfaces of both her arms and hands, including over the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints. There was a 14 × 9-cm pink-brown patch on her upper chest (Fig 1, A). She also had several pink-red patches with white scale on her upper back (Fig 1, B).

Fig 1
Clinical examination findings. A, Large patch on the upper chest and diffuse patches and plaques on the dorsal surfaces of the arms and hands. B, Patches with white scale on the upper back.

Laboratory findings, including creatine kinase, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Smith antibody, aldolase, anti-Ro (SS-A) antibody, anti-La(SS-B) antibody, and anti-Scl70 antibody, were within normal limits. A skin biopsy of the dorsal surface of the right hand showed vacuolar alteration of the dermal-epidermal junction, scattered apoptotic keratinocytes, and a superficial and mid-dermal lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with dermatomyositis (Fig 2). Given her skin findings, the absence of musculoskeletal symptoms, and biopsy result, a diagnosis of amyotrophic dermatomyositis was made. Because the agreement between the clinical examination and the histopathologic findings established a high confidence in the diagnosis, further testing for myositis-specific antibodies was not done.

### Multiple myositis-specific autoantibodies in dermatomyositis: 2 cases and review of the literature [^68b568ae]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

Case 1

A 76-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of burning pruritic rashes. Physical examination was notable for heliotrope rash, pink-violaceous patches on the face and extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, shawl sign, periungual erythema, and dilated nailfold capillaries, without evidence of myositis. Skin biopsies revealed epidermal atrophy and focal interface change suggestive of DM. Laboratory test results were significant for a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1:640 with a speckled pattern, normal creatinine kinase, and normal aldolase. The Extended Myositis Panel (ARUP Laboratories) revealed the presence of anti-TIF1-γ and anti-SAE-1 antibodies. Chest computed tomography revealed small, stable, pulmonary nodules. Screening for malignancy or interstitial lung disease rendered a negative result. Prednisone was not tolerated because of muscle tightness and mania, while hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate were discontinued because of rash and diarrhea. Remission was achieved with cyclosporine and dexamethasone.

Case 2

An 80-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer 3 years previously presented with an 8-month history of fatigue and pruritus. Physical examination was notable for heliotrope rash, shawl sign, Gottron papules, nailfold capillary dropout, and proximal muscle weakness. Skin and muscle biopsies were consistent with DM. Laboratory test results revealed a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1:1280 with a speckled pattern, an antinuclear ribonucleoprotein antibody index of 2.9 (normal range, 0.0–0.9), and a creatinine kinase concentration of 331 U/L (normal range, 26–192 U/L). Her lung cancer was in remission, and no new malignancies were found during screening. The ARUP Extended Myositis Panel revealed positivity for both TIF1-γ and Mi-2 antibodies. Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin, low-dose prednisone, and methotrexate.

### A 50-year-old man with left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking clearly [^c52f783f]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Morning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 50-year-old man who presented for evaluation of weakness on the left side of his body and difficulty speaking clearly. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Immune checkpoint-mediated myositis and myasthenia gravis: a case report and review of evaluation and management [^886c04db]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We present a case of myositis and possible overlapping neuromuscular junction disorder following treatment with nivolumab for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Methods

We report a 75-year-old man with recurrent stage IVA, T1N2cM0 oral cavity HNSCC treated with weight-dosed nivolumab who presented three weeks later with severe fatigue, generalized weakness, and bilateral ptosis. Evaluation demonstrated elevated creatine kinase and myopathic motor units on electromyography, supporting a diagnosis of an underlying muscle disease. Elevated serum acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies raised the possibility of concurrent myasthenia gravis.

Results

He received corticosteroids and plasmapheresis without improvement in muscle weakness. His course was complicated by bacteremia, cardiac arrest, and concerns for recurrent malignancy. Following a two-month hospital stay, he was made comfort care and died.

Conclusions

With increasing usage of checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC, clinicians must be aware of and vigilant for associated rare but serious adverse events.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^83dda4d9]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

RAL — pregnancy safety and adverse events: In the P1026s, P1081, and PANNA studies, RAL was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed in pregnant women, but a case report described 10-fold to 23-fold increases in maternal liver transaminase levels after initiation of RAL with resolution after discontinuation. A postpartum woman experienced eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome with extensive pulmonary involvement that resolved with discontinuation of RAL. In nonpregnant adults initiating RAL-containing therapy (155 nonpregnant adults with HIV; mean age 49.2 years), skeletal muscle toxicity occurred in 23.9% and isolated creatine kinase elevation in 21.3%, with elevations Grade 1 or 2 and self-limiting and fewer than 3% of patients reporting myalgia or muscle weakness.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^beda20bb]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for priapism, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain CBC, WBC count with blood cell differential, platelet count, and coagulation profile in patients with priapism. Obtain further laboratory testing depending upon history, clinical and laboratory findings.

### Severe proximal muscle weakness with normal CK as a presenting feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^56267ceb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, AAV causing muscle weakness is not commonly recognised. The patients with AAV could have extensive vasculitis within the muscle groups despite having a normal CK. Most of the reported cases had MPO-ANCA positive. MRI scans have shown to be very useful for detecting muscle oedema and for targeting muscle biopsy even in patients with normal CK. The use of PET-scans in AAV still needs further evaluation.

Learning points

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) could present with isolated muscle weakness, and therefore after excluding common causes of muscle weakness, further testing should be done to rule out AAV.
Patients with AAV could have extensive vasculitis within the muscle groups despite having a normal creatine kinase (CK) or negative ANCA. This discrepancy in laboratory features with a positive muscle biopsy suggests that a muscle biopsy should be considered to rule out vasculitis if a patient presents with unexplained muscle weakness irrespective of CK levels or ANCA titre.
MRI has a very high sensitivity as a diagnostic test in myositis/vasculitis even in patients with normal CK. MRI can also be used to target muscle biopsy and possibly follow-up patients with myositis/vasculitis. The use of positron-emission tomography scans in AAV still needs further evaluation.

### Post-traumatic Raynaud's phenomenon: a case report [^33cd3f77]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon has multiple etiologies, ranging from occupational causes to systemic disease. Most occupational causes of Raynaud's phenomenon usually present with vascular compromise.

Case Report

A 41-year-old Chinese woman presented to the emergency department with progressive pain and bluish discoloration over her right index finger after minor trauma. The clinical examination revealed discoloration over multiple fingertips on both hands. She was diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon with possible underlying systemic disease. Additional laboratory workup led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with complex regional pain syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is rare for the emergency physician to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon in the setting of minor trauma. It is important to diagnose this condition because of its potential complications.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol) [^875539ed]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LESCOL XL may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including LESCOL XL.

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Avoid concomitant use of LESCOL XL with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with LESCOL XL, lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue LESCOL XL if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if LESCOL XL is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LESCOL XL in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting LESCOL XL. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue LESCOL XL if IMNM is suspected.
