## Question

types of cognitive impairment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the types of cognitive impairment and how they are classified across severity, domains, etiologies, biomarkers, and related functional syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the severity-based clinical stages from subjective complaints through MCI to dementia. Then, I should verify how domain-based subtypes refine risk and prognosis. Next, I will examine etiologic groupings, including neurodegenerative, vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and other disease-specific causes. After that, I need to integrate biomarker frameworks like A/T/N and consider their operational challenges and blood-based assays. Then, I should review data-driven neuropsychological subtypes and functional cognitive disorders that mimic neurodegeneration. Finally, I will draw out practical implications for screening, imaging, prevention, and longitudinal monitoring, making sure to cross-check each step against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the severity-based clinical stages because mislabeling here propagates errors downstream. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as objective decline beyond age/education expectations with preserved activities of daily living, whereas dementia denotes impairment severe enough to interfere with daily function; subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to self-reported decline without objective deficits on standard testing, and within SCD, A/T/N biomarker status stratifies risk of progression, so I need to be precise about these boundaries before layering other axes.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "types" until I specify domain-level subtyping that materially changes prognosis. Amnestic MCI (single- or multi-domain) centers on memory impairment and carries higher risk for Alzheimer's disease progression, while non-amnestic MCI involves language, attention/working memory, visuospatial, and/or executive domains; data-driven analyses in large cohorts also consistently detect amnestic and mixed multidomain patterns that align with graded progression risks, so I should keep both expert-defined and data-derived profiles in view to avoid an overly rigid scheme [^117Pu3XY] [^1144pMga] [^1131LJD4].

> I will now examine etiologic categories, and I need to ensure I distinguish mechanism from phenotype. Neurodegenerative causes include the Alzheimer's disease continuum, frontotemporal dementia spectrum, and Lewy body disease; motor neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS often manifest defined cognitive/behavioral phenotypes (ALSci, ALSbi, ALScbi, ALS-FTD), which I should not overlook when attributing "non-memory" deficits, and posterior cortical atrophy represents a distinct visuoperceptual/visuospatial-led syndrome within the AD/atypical spectrum that complicates a purely memory-centric view [^1132iEGn] [^113A2pLS].

> Wait, let me verify vascular entities because mixed pathologies are common and misattribution is frequent. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) spans asymptomatic or mild forms through major VCI (vascular dementia) and mixed dementia, with harmonized frameworks emphasizing classification across this spectrum; importantly, imaging vascular changes do not exclude coexisting degenerative disease in older adults, so I should confirm that any vascular lesion pattern plausibly explains the clinical syndrome before assigning a primary vascular label [^1176p9BW] [^1175eCDL] [^1143LV23].

> Let me think about systemic and other disease-specific contributions that clinicians frequently encounter. Diabetes is linked to cognitive dysfunction and warrants lifespan cognitive monitoring with particular attention to severe hypoglycemia and older adults; hepatic encephalopathy terminology has shifted toward "acute encephalopathy" in delirium-aligned frameworks; multiple sclerosis shows reproducible cognitive phenotypes centering on processing speed and memory; stroke subtypes (for example, Oxfordshire categories) yield distinct neuropsychological profiles beyond simple "left/right" heuristics; and cancer-related cognitive impairment has an evidence base for nonpharmacologic interventions, all of which must be considered when classifying non-neurodegenerative impairment [^115rgKox] [^117T5nkZ] [^117XSn6P] [^112Tijs4] [^114SddV4] [^114cBKwG].

> Next, I should review biomarker-based classification because it cuts across clinical stages and etiologies. The A/T/N framework dichotomizes amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers and is agnostic to clinical stage; operational challenges remain in harmonizing cut points and cross-modality concordance, but plasma assays for pTau, Aβ composites, and NfL increasingly enable pragmatic AT(N) categorization with moderate-to-high correlations to CSF and useful discrimination of biomarker-defined groups, which can refine prognosis even in SCD and MCI cohorts [^112c63Ka] [^116LwvVC] [^113BmYvt].

> I will now examine data-driven neuropsychological subtypes to ensure I capture heterogeneity that clinician consensus may miss. Large-scale NACC cluster analyses consistently identify five subgroups across normal-to-MCI ranges and reveal that cluster-derived MCI assignments anticipate progression more accurately than consensus diagnoses driven by functional staging; importantly, subtle impairment clusters within "normal cognition" have steeper decline than all-average groups, which argues for incorporating objective profile-based risk stratification into classification [^1144pMga] [^1131LJD4] [^112KkKcg].

> But wait, what if the symptoms are prominent and persistent yet not due to structural neurodegeneration or vascular lesions? Functional cognitive disorders are common in memory clinics and are associated with affective symptoms, negative illness perceptions, and nonprogressive trajectories; I should double-check for these features because mislabeling such cases as prodromal neurodegeneration risks iatrogenic harm and inaccurate prognostication [^111e1z6v].

> Let me synthesize a coherent taxonomy so the clinician can apply it at the bedside. A practical approach is multilayered: first, stage severity from SCD to MCI to dementia; second, assign domain profile (amnestic versus non-amnestic, single versus multidomain) to refine risk; third, attribute etiology where supported (neurodegenerative, vascular spectrum, metabolic/systemic, inflammatory, stroke-related, cancer-related, motor neurodegenerative overlap); fourth, layer A/T/N biomarkers where available to clarify pathophysiology and prognosis; and fifth, actively consider functional cognitive disorders when the clinical pattern and course do not fit organic disease, documenting rationale at each step to prevent drift in diagnosis [^117Pu3XY] [^1176p9BW] [^112c63Ka] [^111e1z6v].

> Next, I should review first-line screening and triage because early steps shape downstream accuracy. In primary care, brief tools such as the Mini-Cog, GPCOG, or AD8 identify patients needing formal evaluation, though recent guidance cautions against Mini-Cog if alternatives are available; any positive screen warrants comprehensive work-up with objective testing, collateral history, and functional assessment before etiologic labeling, and I need to ensure this sequence is followed to avoid premature categorization [^113i5AUT] [^1156rZWs] [^113tKf3R].

> I need to check the role of imaging and laboratory work in etiologic attribution, especially for vascular and mixed cases. MRI is the modality of choice in suspected dementia, with standard protocols including volumetric T1, T2/FLAIR, and T2✱-GRE to detect atrophy, small-vessel disease, and microbleeds; in progressive impairment where cerebral amyloid angiopathy is suspected, GRE or susceptibility-weighted sequences improve detection of lobar hemorrhagic lesions, and the diagnosis of vascular dementia should be made only when the vascular lesion pattern convincingly explains the deficits, otherwise using a mixed label when justified [^113Ts2hs] [^112KmHrz] [^115Dt2RF] [^116pRWaq].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and longitudinal management hooks that flow from classification. For vascular cognitive impairment risk, counsel Mediterranean-style diet, physical activity, weight control, alcohol moderation, and smoking cessation alongside rigorous management of cardiovascular risk factors; in diabetes, embed routine cognitive monitoring across the lifespan with heightened vigilance after severe hypoglycemia and in older adults; in geriatric care, include cognition within multifactorial falls risk assessment, since cognitive status modifies falls prevention strategies and functional outcomes [^115JSBeT] [^116WBz6A] [^115rgKox] [^117T5nkZ] [^111Sye1Z].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I nearly implied that any vascular change on MRI mandates a vascular diagnosis, but I should correct that and reiterate that cerebrovascular imaging findings often coexist with degenerative processes in older adults and must be interpreted in the full clinical context, ideally integrated with domain profiles and, when available, A/T/N biomarkers to avoid misclassification and to communicate prognostic uncertainty transparently in the care plan [^1143LV23] [^112c63Ka].

Cognitive impairment spans a spectrum from **subjective cognitive decline (SCD)** to **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)** and dementia, each with distinct clinical features and progression risks. SCD is characterized by self-reported decline without objective deficits [^111QnRXw], whereas MCI shows measurable impairment with preserved daily function and is subdivided into amnestic and non-amnestic types [^117Pu3XY]. **Dementia** denotes major neurocognitive disorders with significant functional impact, including Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy body, frontotemporal, and mixed dementias. Other recognized categories include delirium, traumatic brain injury-related impairment, and cognitive impairment due to chronic diseases such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease [^112chVap] [^112Tijs4]. Accurate classification and diagnosis are essential for **management and prognosis** [^1156rZWs].

---

## Subjective cognitive decline (SCD)

Subjective cognitive decline is defined as **self-perceived decline without objective deficits** on standard tests [^111QnRXw]. Clinical features include memory complaints with intact daily function and increased anxiety about cognition. It confers a higher risk of future cognitive decline and dementia than peers without such complaints.

---

## Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

- **Definition**: Objective impairment greater than expected for age/education, with preserved daily function [^117Pu3XY].
- **Clinical features**: Memory, attention, language, or executive deficits without significant functional impairment.
- **Subtypes** include **amnestic MCI**, which primarily affects memory and carries a higher risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease, and **non-amnestic MCI**, which involves other domains (language, attention, visuospatial) and may progress to non-Alzheimer's dementias.
- **Progression risk**: About 10–15% per year progress to dementia; some remain stable or revert to normal [^117Pu3XY] [^115HtQQX].

---

## Major neurocognitive disorders (dementia)

Major neurocognitive disorders are defined by **significant cognitive decline that interferes with independence** [^113i5AUT]. Clinical features span memory, language, executive, visuospatial, and behavioral changes. Common types include Alzheimer's disease, with progressive memory and executive decline; vascular dementia, with stepwise decline from cerebrovascular disease; Lewy body dementia, with fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism; frontotemporal dementia, with early behavioral or language changes; and mixed dementia, with combined Alzheimer's and vascular pathology.

---

## Delirium

Delirium is an **acute, fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness**. Clinical features include rapid onset, fluctuating course, inattention, and altered consciousness. Common precipitants include infections, medications, metabolic disturbances, and surgery.

---

## Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related cognitive impairment

TBI-related cognitive impairment refers to deficits resulting from **external brain injury**. Clinical features include problems with memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed. Severity is classified as mild (concussion), moderate, or severe.

---

## Cognitive impairment associated with chronic medical conditions

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular disease cause memory, attention, and executive deficits [^112chVap].
- **Multiple sclerosis**: Processing speed, memory, and executive deficits from demyelination and neurodegeneration [^112Tijs4].
- **Parkinson's disease**: Executive, attention, and memory deficits from dopaminergic dysfunction.

---

## Functional cognitive disorders

In functional cognitive disorders, cognitive symptoms arise from **functional alterations rather than structural disease**. Clinical features include subjective complaints, distress, a non-progressive course, and often coexisting affective symptoms [^111e1z6v].

---

## Classification systems and diagnostic criteria

**DSM-5** provides standardized criteria for neurocognitive disorders, while ICD-10 offers an international classification of cognitive disorders. For Alzheimer's disease, the **A/T/N system** provides a biomarker-based classification [^112c63Ka] [^116LwvVC].

---

## Diagnostic tools and assessments

- **Cognitive screening tests**: MMSE, MoCA, Mini-Cog, GP Assessment of Cognition [^113i5AUT].
- **Neuropsychological testing**: Detailed domain-specific assessment [^1156rZWs].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI, CT, PET to identify structural and functional changes [^113Ts2hs].
- **Biomarkers**: CSF and plasma markers for Alzheimer's and other dementias [^113BmYvt] [^112c63Ka].

### Mild cognitive impairment [^117Pu3XY]. Lancet (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on mild cognitive impairment:

- **Definition**: MCI is defined as a cognitive decline greater than expected for an individual's age and education level but does not interfere notably with activities of daily life.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of MCI is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve both neurodegenerative and vascular factors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of MCI increases with age, with reported prevalence rates of 6.7% in patients aged 60–64 years, 10.2% in patients aged 70–74 years, and up to 37.6% in patients aged ≥ 85 years.

- **Risk factors**: Common risk factors for MCI include age, family history of Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia, and certain genetic factors such as the presence of the APOE ε4 allele.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of MCI is progressive, with individuals experiencing a decline in cognitive function over time. There are two main types of MCI: amnestic, primarily affecting memory, and non-amnestic, affecting other cognitive skills such as language, attention, and visuospatial skills.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of MCI is variable. While many individuals with MCI progress to dementia (more than half within 5 years), particularly Alzheimer's disease, others may remain stable or even revert to normal cognitive function. The amnestic subtype of MCI carries a high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease.

Mixed etiologies were common. In participants with a primary etiology of AD (n = 3012), one or more secondary etiologies were present in 29.0% of cases, the most common being psychiatric conditions (14.8%), vascular disease (7.3%), systemic/medical illness (2.9%), and LBD (2.6%). In participants with a primary non-AD etiology (n = 772), one or more secondary etiologies were present in 46.6% of cases. The most common secondary etiologies were AD (21.9%), psychiatric conditions (20.3%), systemic/medical illness (4.0%), and vascular disease (3.5%).

### Cognitive phenotypes in multiple sclerosis [^112Tijs4]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a debilitating symptom experienced by approximately 50% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, with processing speed (PS) and memory most affected. Traditionally, cognition has been considered in a binary fashion: patients are designated as either impaired or not impaired. This designation is typically determined by administering a full cognitive battery and assigning a cutoff (e.g. failing 4 out of 11 tests) to distinguish between impaired and non-impaired. This relatively coarse approach yields a heterogeneous group of "impaired" patients, some of whom may have isolated memory or PS deficits, while others exhibit combined deficits. This study aims to determine whether predominant patterns of deficits, referred to as "cognitive phenotypes", can be identified in a large sample of MS patients. The proportional representation of four cognitive phenotypes will be evaluated: (1) not impaired, (2) PS-impaired only, (3) memory-impaired only, and (4) PS + memory impaired.

- **Methods**: Cognition was measured in 128 relapsing-remitting MS patients using validated tests of verbal/visual memory and PS. Cognitive phenotype representation was evaluated, and differences in age, education, disease duration, and IQ across cognitive phenotype groups were analyzed.

- **Results**: Four cognitive phenotype groups were represented in the sample: 56.3% not impaired, 7.8% PS-impaired, 18.8% memory-impaired, and 17.2% PS + memory impaired. Across groups, there were no significant differences in age, education, or disease duration. However, IQ in the non-impaired group was higher than in the PS + memory impaired group.

- **Conclusions**: Adopting a novel classification taxonomy for cognitive phenotypes in MS patients provides a more refined understanding of cognitive deficits.

### What is the relationship between health, mood, and mild cognitive impairment [^1153oZm4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

- **Classification of cognitive status**: Cognitive status categories were defined using the cognitive status algorithm. Participants classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) displayed an objective cognitive impairment, an absence of dementia, intact activities of daily living (ADLs), and intact general cognition. This was demonstrated by a score equal to or greater than 22 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and the presence of subjective memory complaints (SMC), indicated by a positive response by the participant to a self-report question regarding memory difficulties and forgetting [45].

The MCIW category included all participants who would otherwise meet criteria for MCI, except that they did not report SMC. Objective cognitive impairment was defined using the Cambridge Cognition Examination, which formed a section of the CFAS Wales interview, with scores falling one standard deviation below age-adjusted norms on any of the cognitive domains taken to represent cognitive impairment.

### A/T/N: An unbiased descriptive classification scheme for Alzheimer disease biomarkers [^112c63Ka]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Biomarkers have become an essential component of Alzheimer disease (AD) research, and because of the pervasiveness of AD pathology in the elderly, the same biomarkers are used in cognitive aging research. A number of issues suggest that an unbiased descriptive classification scheme for these biomarkers would be useful. We propose the "A/T/N" system in which seven major AD biomarkers are divided into three binary categories based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures. "A" refers to the value of a β-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42); "T", the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and "N", biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Each biomarker category is rated as positive or negative. An individual score might appear as A+/T+/N-, or A+/T-/N-, etc. The A/T/N system includes the new modality tau PET. It is agnostic to the temporal ordering of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. It includes all individuals in any population regardless of the mix of biomarker findings and, therefore, is suited to population studies of cognitive aging. It does not specify disease labels and thus is not a diagnostic classification system. It serves as a descriptive system for categorizing multidomain biomarker findings at the individual person level in a format that is easy to understand and use. Given the present lack of consensus among AD specialists on terminology across the clinically normal to dementia spectrum, a biomarker classification scheme will have the broadest acceptance.

### Tiagabine hydrochloride [^115xasa3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adverse events most often associated with the use of tiagabine HCl were related to the central nervous system. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) impaired concentration, speech or language problems, and confusion (effects on thought processes); and 2) somnolence and fatigue (effects on level of consciousness). The majority of these events were mild to moderate. In controlled clinical trials, these events led to discontinuation of treatment with tiagabine HCl in 6% (31 of 494) of patients compared to 2% (5 of 275) of the placebo-treated patients. A total of 1.6% (8 of 494) of the tiagabine HCl-treated patients in the controlled trials were hospitalized secondary to the occurrence of these events compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. Some of these events were dose-related and usually began during initial titration.

Patients with a history of spike and wave discharges on EEG have been reported to have exacerbations of their EEG abnormalities associated with these cognitive/neuropsychiatric events. This raises the possibility that these clinical events may, in some cases, be a manifestation of underlying seizure activity (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests, EEG). In the documented cases of spike and wave discharges on EEG with cognitive/neuropsychiatric events, patients usually continued tiagabine but required dosage adjustment.

### Data-driven classification of cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment subtypes predicts progression in the NACC dataset [^1144pMga]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024).

- **Neuropsychological cluster-derived groups**: Results of the cluster analysis on the full sample of 26,255 participants revealed five cognitive subgroups:
	1. Optimal CN (oCN; n = 3465; 13.2%) with above-average to average cognition in all domains examined.
	2. Typical CN (tCN; n = 7358; 28.0%) with average cognition across domains.
	3. Amnestic MCI (aMCI; n = 6649; 25.3%) with isolated low memory performance.
	4. Mixed MCI-Mild (mMCI-Mild; n = 5363; 20.4%) with low performance across domains.
	5. Mixed MCI-Severe (mMCI-Severe; n = 3420; 13.0%) with more severe multidomain impairment including significant executive dysfunction.

	- Figure 1 shows baseline neuropsychological performance of the (A) cluster-derived groups and (B) NACC consensus diagnostic groups. Error bars denote the standard error of the mean. CN, cognitively normal; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NACC, National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.

There were demographic differences among the five cluster groups (see Table 1). The oCN and tCN groups were significantly younger than the three MCI groups, and the mMCI-Severe group was the oldest of all five groups. The groups also differed in years of education, as the tCN group had a significantly higher level of education relative to all groups except mMCI-Mild, and the mMCI-Severe group had the lowest level of education relative to all groups. The oCN group had more women relative to all other groups, and the tCN group had more women relative to the mMCI-Mild group. The proportion of non-White participants was lowest in the oCN group.

### Social cognition in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LYFJV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

We considered theory of mind (ToM) and empathy as higher-order cognitive processes requiring social understanding and contextual interpretation. However, substantial heterogeneity and ambiguity exist in their definitions and subdomains. For example, affective ToM and cognitive empathy are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature, although some definitions differentiate them, suggesting that cognitive empathy involves emotional awareness. Given this heterogeneity, we classified ToM and empathy based on the original articles' definitions. We conducted separate analyses for cognitive empathy and emotional empathy because all included studies assessing empathy used the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), which provides distinct subscales for these components. However, such subgroup analyses were not feasible for ToM due to the diversity of assessments and the lack of consistent separation between affective and cognitive ToM in the included studies.

We performed meta-analyses of the standardized mean differences in social cognition between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, where two or more studies assessed the same domain of social cognition using similar paradigms. The mean scores and standard deviations (SDs) were used in the meta-analysis. If such information was not available, we calculated or transformed the existing data to obtain these where applicable. A random-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes, and the overall pooled effect size and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the magnitude of the effect. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using appropriate statistical methods.

### Functional cognitive disorders: a systematic review [^111e1z6v]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Cognitive symptoms are common, and yet many who seek help for cognitive symptoms neither have nor go on to develop dementia. A proportion of these individuals are likely to have functional cognitive disorders, a subtype of functional neurological disorders, in which cognitive symptoms are present, associated with distress or disability, but caused by functional alterations rather than degenerative brain disease or another structural lesion. In this review, we have systematically examined the prevalence and clinical associations of functional cognitive disorders and related phenotypes within the wider cognitive disorder literature.

Around a quarter of patients presenting to memory clinics received diagnoses that might indicate the presence of functional cognitive disorders. These disorders were associated with affective symptoms, negative self-evaluation, negative illness perceptions, non-progressive symptom trajectories, and linguistic and behavioral differences during clinical interactions. Those with functional cognitive disorder phenotypes are at risk of iatrogenic harm due to misdiagnosis or inaccurate prediction of future decline. Further research is imperative to improve diagnosis and identify effective treatments for functional cognitive disorders. Better understanding of these phenotypes will also improve the specificity of diagnoses of prodromal degenerative brain disease.

### Evaluation of suspected dementia [^113i5AUT]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for mild cognitive impairment, specifically concerning the initial assessment, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend using the Mini-Cog, the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, or the Ascertain Dementia 8-Item Informant Questionnaire in patients with suspected dementia to determine the need for further evaluation.

### Data-driven classification of cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment subtypes predicts progression in the NACC dataset [^1156RVtK]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

To examine cognitive heterogeneity within pre-MCI, we applied our objective methods to comprehensive neuropsychological test data from 365 participants in the UCSD ADRC sample who were determined to have "normal cognition" based on consensus diagnosis. Cluster analysis of neuropsychological test scores identified four subgroups of participants. Three subgroups showed subtle cognitive decline with low scores in memory/language, executive, and/or visuospatial domains. A cognitively normal group had average performance across all cognitive domains assessed (i.e. an All-Average group). Rates of cognitive decline and progression to MCI/dementia were steeper in the subtle cognitive decline groups (Low-All Domains > Low Memory/Language ≥ Low-Visuospatial and Low-Executive) than in the All-Average group.

The present study extends this work from a single ADRC to the larger National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) sample by applying cluster analysis to baseline neuropsychological test data for all NACC participants without dementia, and to a subsample limited to those classified as "normal cognition". Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that cognitive subtypes of MCI and subtle cognitive impairment would emerge, which would be predictive of subsequent risk of progression to MCI/dementia.

### Challenges associated with biomarker-based classification systems for Alzheimer's disease [^116LwvVC]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently conceptualized as a clinicobiological entity. Accordingly, modern clinical and research criteria have integrated biomarkers for the in-vivo identification of the AD pathophysiological state. Biomarkers can be divided into two main modalities: neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. They can also be subdivided according to their specificity for different pathophysiological categories, including cerebral amyloid deposition, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration.

Diagnostic recommendations consider the information provided by a growing number of biomarkers. Consequently, biomarker-based classification systems have been proposed to integrate the information provided by the different sets of biomarkers. Specifically, the A/T/N system has been recently proposed to dichotomize the biomarker results from three different pathophysiological categories: cerebral amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration (N). While some classification systems consider the individual clinical status, others, such as the A/T/N system, are proposed to be applicable across all clinical diagnostic stages independent of cognitive status. This approach provides an integrative framework for AD research and cognitive aging.

However, the operationalization of biomarker-based classification systems poses challenges before it can be applied in clinical practice. Foremost, subject classification at the individual level must be consistent across biomarker modalities and be faithful to the pathophysiology.

### Vascular cognitive impairment: Current concepts and clinical developments [^112xgEub]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) comprises a range of cognitive disorders related to cerebral vessel disease and has generally replaced the term multi-infarct dementia. Despite the heterogeneity of the VCI construct, some clinical patterns can be discerned, which enable subtypes, such as mixed dementia and VCI-no dementia, to be recognized. Diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia do not encompass the full range of the VCI construct. Clinical investigators now recognize the need for harmonized standards to study the many manifestations of VCI seen in daily practice and to inform the development of diagnostic criteria. Although executive dysfunction is a recognized feature of VCI, some data suggest a less exclusive role than was previously proposed. VCI might be preventable, although the evidence for this is not as complete as it is for the prevention of stroke. Future studies into specific therapies for VCI will need to consider the clinical features and outcomes carefully.

### Cognitive performance, psychological well-being, and brain magnetic resonance imaging in older patients with type 1 diabetes [^116zyvQZ]. Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Modest cognitive impairment has been reported in young-adult patients with type 1 diabetes. In older patients with type 2 diabetes, cognitive impairments are more pronounced, which might be due to age but also to differential effects of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on the brain. This study therefore assessed cognitive performance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in older type 1 diabetic patients. Forty type 1 diabetic patients (age > 50 years) and 40 age-matched control subjects were included.

Neuropsychological assessment included all major cognitive domains, and psychological well-being was assessed with questionnaires. Atrophy, white-matter abnormalities, and infarcts were rated on MRI scans. Type 1 diabetic patients performed slightly (effect sizes < 0.4) worse on cognitive tasks, but only "speed of information processing" reached statistical significance. No significant between-group differences were found on any of the MRI parameters. Type 1 diabetic patients tended to report more cognitive and depressive problems than control subjects, but this did not correlate with the performance on cognitive tests.

We conclude that cognition in older type 1 diabetic patients is only mildly disturbed. Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia is, in itself, even at older age, apparently not sufficient to have considerable impact on the brain.

### Principles of classification analyses in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease [^117DLsBs]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2011). Low credibility.

The majority of advanced neuroimaging studies implement group-level analyses contrasting a group of patients with a group of controls, or two groups of patients. Such analyses may, for example, identify changes in grey matter in specific regions associated with a given disease. Although these group investigations have provided key contributions to understanding the pathological processes surrounding a wide range of diseases, they have limited utility at an individual level. Recently, there is a trend towards individual classification analyses, representing a fundamental shift in the research paradigm. In contrast to group comparisons, individual classification analyses do not provide insights into vulnerable brain areas but may allow for early (and ideally preclinical) identification of at-risk individuals in routine clinical settings. One currently very popular method in this domain is support vector machines (SVM). However, this method is only one of many available in the field of individual classification analyses. The manuscript reviews the fundamental properties and features of such individual-level classification analyses in neurodegenerative diseases.

### The vascular impairment of cognition classification consensus study [^1175eCDL]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Numerous diagnostic criteria have attempted to address the variability in clinical manifestations and the problematic diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), but none have been universally accepted. These criteria have not been readily comparable, affecting clinical diagnosis rates and in turn, prevalence estimates, research, and treatment.

- **Methods**: The Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS) involved participants (81% academic researchers) from 27 countries in an online Delphi consensus study. Participants reviewed previously proposed concepts to develop new guidelines.

- **Results**: VICCCS had a mean of 122 (range 98–153) respondents across the study and required a 67% threshold to represent consensus. VICCCS redefined VCI including classification of mild and major forms of VCI and subtypes. It proposes new standardized VCI-associated terminology and future research priorities to address gaps in knowledge.

- **Discussion**: VICCCS proposes a consensus-based updated conceptualization of VCI intended to facilitate standardization in research.

### Data-driven classification of cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment subtypes predicts progression in the NACC dataset [^112KkKcg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

- **Comparisons to consensus diagnosis**: The number of participants in each cluster-derived group is shown as a function of consensus diagnostic groups. Overall, the cluster analysis classified a greater number of individuals as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), accounting for 58.8% of the sample, compared to the consensus method, which identified 32.4% of the sample with MCI and an additional 6.6% as impaired-not-MCI. Within NACC's MCI cohort, 84.2% were also classified into one of the cluster-derived MCI groups. However, only 55.5% of NACC's "normal cognition" cohort were classified into one of the cluster-derived cognitively normal (CN) groups, while 24.6% were classified into the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group and 19.9% into one of the mixed MCI (mMCI) groups. The majority of the NACC "impaired-not-MCI" group was distributed fairly evenly across the CN, aMCI, and mMCI-Mild groups. In contrast to the cluster-derived groups, which were based on comprehensive neuropsychological test performance, the consensus diagnoses appeared to be heavily driven by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Approximately 90% of consensus "normal cognition" participants had a global CDR of 0.0 (mean CDR = 0.05, SD = 0.15), and about 90% of consensus MCI participants had a global CDR of 0.5 or above (mean CDR = 0.46, SD = 0.17).

Of participants who progressed to a diagnosis of dementia, 68.2% (n = 2579) were classified as having MCI at baseline by the consensus diagnosis, while 80.3% (n = 3039) were classified as having MCI at baseline by the cluster analysis. This included 1046 in the aMCI group, 1007 in the mMCI-Mild group, and 986 in the mMCI-Severe group.

### Classification, prediction, and concordance of cognitive and functional progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment in the United States: A latent class analysis [^1129eDAj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that greatly impairs the quality of life of patients and close family members. An estimated 5.8 million Americans currently live with AD, and this figure is projected to rise to 13.8 million by 2050, mainly due to population aging. Given the high costs related to dementia care, AD is expected to impose a growing burden on the United States (US) healthcare system unless a better understanding of AD enables the development of therapies able to halt or slow disease progression. Furthermore, the total number of people with dementia is projected to increase globally in the next decade by 64% (from 50 to 82 million) and to triple by 2050, posing a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems worldwide.

There is strong evidence that AD pathological changes begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Guidelines from the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Association categorize AD progression into three stages: 1) a preclinical phase characterized by biomarker anomalies, but without cognitive decline; 2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is characterized by short-term and persistent memory problems; and 3) dementia, which is characterized by more severe cognitive and functional impairment.

Nonetheless, there is substantial heterogeneity in the rate of progression along this continuum among individual patients with AD. In the 15-year prospective Religious Orders study, 65% of participants exhibited a slow cognitive decline, and 27% exhibited a moderate cognitive decline.

### Neuropsychological profiles of 5-year ischemic stroke survivors by Oxfordshire stroke classification and hemisphere of lesion [^114SddV4]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Although the neuropsychological literature typically examines stroke outcomes by hemisphere of lesion, the medical literature provides classifications more closely linked to the circulatory distribution impacted by stroke. This article examined profiles of cognitive function by hemisphere and by Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project stroke classification.

- **Methods**: This study included a sample of 315 5-year ischemic stroke survivors. Assessment included tests of verbal memory, visual memory, word finding/verbal fluency, abstract visual reasoning, executive functioning, and speed of processing.

- **Results**: The sample produced scores within 1 standard deviation of the normative mean on tests of abstract visual reasoning, verbal memory, and visual recall. Impaired performances were observed for executive function and processing speed. Profile analysis revealed no significant differences in overall cognitive performance or in the profile of performance across measures by hemisphere of lesion. However, groups defined by Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project categories produced significantly different cognitive profiles. Post hoc analyses indicate those with posterior stroke performed best overall on all tests except the Stroop Dots trial, whereas those with total anterior stroke produced significantly worse scores on tasks requiring visual abstract reasoning (Block Design, Rey Figure Copy), word finding (Boston Naming Test), and processing speed (Stroop Dots, Trails A).

- **Conclusions**: Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project stroke subtypes identified significant differences in cognitive profiles among ischemic stroke survivors.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115rgKox]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for cognitive impairment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring cognitive capacity throughout the lifespan for all patients with diabetes. This is particularly important for those with documented cognitive disabilities, those experiencing severe hypoglycemia, very young children, and older adults.

### Adolescent cognitive function and incident early-onset type 2 diabetes [^115RpfxT]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Early-onset type 2 diabetes, defined as onset of diabetes by age 40 years, is increasing disproportionately worldwide. It has a worse clinical course, with a risk for long-term complications, and might be associated with novel risk factors such as intelligence and cognition variability. Cognitive epidemiology, which emerged in the early 2000s, studies how and why individual differences in intelligence (especially when measured in childhood or young adulthood) are associated with later differences in health, illness, and death.

While diabetes is recognized as a risk factor for cognitive impairment later in life, evidence suggests that the association may be bidirectional. Accordingly, cognitive function among apparently healthy adolescents has been associated with incident type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some studies have assessed cognitive function in adolescence and the risk for type 2 diabetes; however, only a few studies provided data with respect to specific cognitive subdomains.

A nationally representative study sample of approximately 1 million adolescents was used, who were screened for cognitive status as part of their assessment for mandatory military service. Cognitive assessment included measures of problem-solving abilities, verbal abstraction and categorization, verbal comprehension, and mathematical abilities, as well as a measure summing all these into a global cognitive score. These data were linked to the Israel National Diabetes Registry (INDR) to assess relations between cognitive function and early-onset type 2 diabetes.

### Classification, prediction, and concordance of cognitive and functional progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment in the United States: A latent class analysis [^116njiKG]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

**Materials and methods**: This study utilized the US National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) from September 2005 through February 2019. Data were sourced from 26 Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs) supported by the US National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health. Information on participants' demographics, family history, medical history, cognitive and functional status, behavioral symptoms, and clinical diagnoses of cognitive impairment (including single-clinician or consensus-based determinations) was available. Participants enrolled at an ADC through referral or as volunteers and may have had normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia at the time of enrollment. Data were collected prospectively on an approximately annual basis using a standardized clinical evaluation. Measures collected at yearly visits included various assessments of cognitive and functional abilities, such as the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR®) Dementia Staging Instrument-Global Score (CDR-GS), CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).

### Classification, prediction, and concordance of cognitive and functional progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment in the United States: A latent class analysis [^117CuTvv]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The present study has several strengths. First, in contrast to most previous research, the present study focused exclusively on participants with incident MCI with AD etiology, given that the potential clinical benefits of experimental agents are hypothesized to manifest mainly in patients who initiate treatment in the prodromal stage of AD. This group is therefore particularly relevant for the conduct of future trials and for the identification of participants at high risk of subsequent cognitive and functional decline.

Second, NACC data are contributed by a network of AD experts practicing in ADCs in the US and allow for a large, well-characterized sample used in the present study. Third, progression was assessed based on both cognitive and functional measures. The CDR-SB is a comprehensive measure of dementia severity that incorporates both cognitive and function components; the MMSE is a measure of cognitive abilities; and the FAQ assesses participants' routine functional abilities.

Fourth, the study used a data-driven approach to derive progression trajectories; all available data on the outcomes of interest were incorporated in the latent class analyses, thereby limiting potential biases that may ensue from the selection of only participants with complete longitudinal data.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the Brief Assessment of Impaired Cognition case-finding instrument in a general practice setting and comparison with other widely used brief cognitive tests-a cross-validation study [^112CkHzj]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Supplementary analyses found that all instruments had relatively poorer AUCs and sensitivity for very mild cognitive impairment (defined ad hoc by splitting the cognitively impaired group in halves) and relatively better AUCs and sensitivity for mild to moderate impairment. In the very mild cognitive impairment comparison condition, MoCA, which was designed for identification of MCI, did not perform significantly better than other instruments except for the CDT‐6. In the mild to moderate cognitive impairment comparison, all instruments except for the CDT‐6 had good to excellent classification accuracy.

The memory test components of BASIC, MMSE, MoCA, and RUDAS all had fair classification accuracy in the all cognitive impairment comparison versus normal cognition condition and good accuracy in the mild to moderate cognitive impairment comparison. BASIC CCMT had higher specificity than the other memory tests across the comparison conditions, but very poor sensitivity in the very mild impairment comparison condition. The optimal cutoff score for CCMT was 7/8, indicating a ceiling effect, whereas the optimal cutoff for MoCA delayed recall was 1/2, indicating a floor effect. The CCMT is inspired by the picture‐based memory impairment screen and the memory impairment screen (MIS), both of which were previously reported to have excellent classification accuracy for dementia versus normal cognition. It has been proposed that the use of 'controlled learning', applying the same category cues at acquisition and retrieval, may optimize encoding specificity and possibly improve discrimination.

### The impact of hearing loss on clinical dementia and preclinical cognitive impairment in later life [^113bqxnq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Dementia and cognitive impairment were significantly associated with hearing loss. The impact of hearing loss on dementia and cognitive impairment is understudied, particularly concerning the different effects on cognitive impairment according to types of hearing loss.

- **Objective**: The present study was conducted to elucidate the association between clinically diagnosed dementia and hearing loss with consideration of the type of hearing loss among an elderly population, and to explore the effects of different types of hearing loss on preclinical cognitive impairment.

- **Methods**: Data (n = 59,675) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for cognitive impairment according to type of hearing loss, including conductive, sensorineural, mixed, noise-induced hearing losses, and presbycusis. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire-Prescreening (KDSQ-P).

- **Results**: Cognitive impairment was significantly associated with conductive (OR: 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–1.77), sensorineural (OR: 1.23, CI: 1.12–1.36), noise-induced hearing loss (OR: 1.32, CI: 1.12–1.56), and presbycusis (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.25–1.87). Among participants scoring positive on the KDSQ-P (score ≥ 4), the KDSQ-P score was significantly elevated in the mixed and noise-induced hearing loss groups.

- **Conclusion**: This study revealed a significant correlation between different types of hearing loss and cognitive impairment. Noise-induced hearing loss is especially important because it occurs earlier than other forms of hearing loss, underscoring the need for early intervention and further research in this area.

### The prognosis of mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HtQQX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

- **Clinical-based studies**: The systematic review included 66 clinical‐based studies with a total of 21,822 participants diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), ranging from 53 to 6651 participants per study. The most commonly used diagnostic criteria were the Petersen criteria (42 studies, 63.6%), followed by the Winblad criteria (13 studies, 19.7%) and the Albert criteria (7 studies, 10.6%). Four studies (6.1%) used both Petersen and Winblad criteria. Among these, 21 studies (31.8%) included only participants with amnestic MCI (aMCI), while 45 studies did not limit the inclusion to any specific MCI subtype.

	- Participant demographics revealed a mean age of 71.1 years (SD 4.1), with ages ranging from 61.0 to 81.7 years. In terms of gender, 63 studies reported a mean of 53.5% female participants, with a range from 28.6% to 67.6%. The mean level of education at baseline, reported in 34 studies, was 10.4 years, ranging from 4.0 to 15.6 years. Additionally, information on the APOE genotype was available in 34 studies, with 38.3% of participants being carriers of the ε4 allele, ranging from 10.9% to 60.2%.

- **Prognosis evaluation of MCI**: Out of the 66 studies, 36 assessed the conversion of MCI to all-cause dementia, while 30 studies focused exclusively on Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an outcome. The DSM‐IV/IV‐TR criteria were most frequently used for diagnosing dementia (19 studies, 28.8%), followed by DSM‐III/III‐R criteria (6 studies, 9.1%). The remaining 41 studies (62.1%) utilized other internationally established criteria.

### Reforming the taxonomy in disorders of consciousness [^115BJKLW]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

This article examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the taxonomy of postcomatose disorders of consciousness (DoC) and provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioral criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (e.g. information derived from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging) and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a multidimensional framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioral tasks.

### Social cognition in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GuEyG]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

There were limitations related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) populations in the included studies. Among participants with AD dementia, amyloid-beta (Aβ) markers were not thoroughly examined; only 279 of 887 AD diagnoses included Aβ information. As a result, the findings may not fully reflect biomarker-defined AD populations, which are emphasized increasingly in research and clinical trials.

For MCI participants in the included studies, most had amnestic MCI (aMCI), a subtype closely linked with progression to AD dementia. Consequently, comparisons between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and aMCI primarily reflect differences between FTD and prodromal AD dementia rather than capturing the social cognitive changes along the FTD continuum. There were a small number of non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) cases in the included studies, but the lack of information on the neuropathology and cognitive domains affected makes it unclear whether these naMCI cases may relate to FTD. Therefore, we were unable to conduct subgroup analyses comparing how these naMCI subtypes differ from AD dementia and FTD in terms of social cognitive impairments.

Nonetheless, comparisons between FTD and MCI support the more profound social cognitive impairments in the FTD dementia subtype.

### Validation of the revised classification of cognitive and behavioural impairment in ALS [^1132iEGn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

In 2017, the diagnostic criteria for cognitive and behavioural impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with frontotemporal dementia (ALSFTD-1) were modified (ALSFTD-2). This revision included the introduction of a novel category, ALS with combined cognitive and behavioural impairment (ALScbi), and changes to the operational criteria of the other categories: ALS with cognitive impairment (ALSci), ALS with behavioural impairment (ALSbi), and ALS with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). We compared the two sets of criteria to assess the effect of these revisions on the cognitive classification of patients with ALS.

Two cohorts of patients with ALS were included in this study: a population-based cohort identified through the Piemonte/Valle d'Aosta register for ALS during the 2014–2017 period (n = 321), and a referral cohort recruited at the Turin ALS centre and at the ALS centre of the Maugeri Institute in Milan during the same period (n = 205). Cognitive function was classified in a blind manner by two neuropsychologists expert in ALS.

The ALSFTD-2 criteria resulted in a shift of about 15% of patients from their original category to a new one. In both cohorts, approximately 9% of patients were reclassified into the novel category ALScbi. Among patients previously classified as cognitively normal, 14 (4.3%, population-based cohort) and 19 (9.3%, referral cohort) were reclassified as ALSbi or ALSci. The median survival for the different categories was significantly different with both sets of criteria.

In conclusion, the new ALSFTD-2 criteria, when compared to the older version, revealed significant shifts in patient classification, which highlights the importance of the revised criteria in understanding cognitive impairments associated with ALS.

### Cognition in cerebellar disorders: What's in the profile? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KdYSi]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

It must be emphasized that the allocation of neuropsychological tests to cognitive domains may differ across studies and are sometimes debated. One important reason for this is that neuropsychological tests are not always process pure in nature and commonly rely on multiple cognitive domains. For example, verbal fluency tests touch both domains of language and executive function. However, we opted for allocation to the language domain because language processing is regarded as the core component of these tests.

Outcomes revealed substantial heterogeneity of study outcomes, indicated by I² values ranging from 65 to 89% across domains. The large variation in outcomes between studies may, in part, be explained by the different neuropsychological tests used. The challenge of operationalizing cognitive domains also plays a role here since numerous diverse measures were classified into single domains. To illustrate, all extracted test outcomes from the included studies encompassed 126 different neuropsychological tests, which were ultimately grouped into nine cognitive domains. In addition to the differences in outcome measures, the wide variety of included cerebellar etiologies is also likely to have contributed to the large heterogeneity. Given the large number of potentially relevant variables and the relatively small number of studies, meta-regression to identify those variables that moderated the variability in cognitive outcomes was unfortunately not possible.

Cognitive profiles may differ among the wide range of cerebellar disorders, and therefore, cognitive performance.

### Use of plasma biomarkers for AT(N) classification of neurodegenerative dementias [^113BmYvt]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

All categories included in the AT(N) classification can now be measured in plasma; however, their agreement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers is not fully established. A blood signature to generate the AT(N) classification would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through an easy and minimally invasive approach.

- **Methods**: We measured Aβ, pTau181, and neurofilament light (NfL) in 150 plasma samples from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. This cohort includes patients with mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and cognitively normal participants. We classified participants in the AT(N) categories according to CSF biomarkers and studied the diagnostic value of plasma biomarkers within each category individually and in combination.

- **Results**: The plasma Aβ composite, pTau181, and NfL yielded areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.88, respectively, to discriminate positive and negative participants in their respective A, T, and N categories. The combination of all three markers did not outperform pTau181 alone (AUC = 0.81) in discriminating A+T+ from A-T- participants. There was a moderate correlation between plasma Aβ composite and CSF Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 (Rho = -0.5, p < 0.001) and between plasma pTau181 and CSF pTau181 in the entire cohort (Rho = 0.51, p < 0.001). NfL levels in plasma showed a high correlation with those in CSF (Rho = 0.78, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Plasma biomarkers are useful to detect the AT(N) categories, and their use can differentiate patients with pathophysiological evidence of AD.

### Early cognitive change in the general population: How do different definitions work [^112uvb8z]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

To explore the application of existing classifications of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and associated states in a large population sample, a prospective cohort study was conducted during the baseline phase using cross-sectional analysis. This large-scale multicenter study took place in the United Kingdom and involved thirteen thousand four individuals aged 65 and older from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study. From this study, a subsample of 2,640 individuals was selected for a more detailed cognitive assessment.

Information on sociodemographic status, general health, cognitive impairment (measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination), and functional ability was collected in a structured interview at baseline. The Geriatric Mental State Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer-Assisted Taxonomy and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination were used to assess cognitive status. Through a systematic literature review, all symptom classifications for non-normal dementia states were collected and operationalized retrospectively. Each participant was classified accordingly.

Results indicated that population prevalence estimates were variable, ranging from 0.1% to 42%, reflecting differences in the focus and content of each state. Limited overlap existed between states, with many individuals being concurrently classified as normal and impaired. This highlights the heterogeneity in classification as captured using different definitions.

The conclusion of the study emphasized that the classification of cognitively impaired and cognitively normal individuals is dependent on the definitions applied.

### Cognitive and cognitive-motor interventions affecting physical functioning: A systematic review [^113uCcxq]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Several types of cognitive or combined cognitive-motor interventions that might influence physical functions have been proposed in the past. These include training of dual-tasking abilities and improving cognitive function through behavioral interventions or the use of computer games. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the literature regarding the use of cognitive and cognitive-motor interventions to improve physical functioning in older adults or people with neurological impairments similar to cognitive impairments seen in aging. The aim was to identify potentially promising methods that might be used in future intervention studies for older adults.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted using the Medline/Premedline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. The search focused on older adults over the age of 65. To increase the number of articles for review, we also included those discussing adult patients with neurological impairments due to trauma, as these cognitive impairments are similar to those seen in the aging population. The search was restricted to English, German, and French language literature without limitation of publication date or restriction by study design. Cognitive or cognitive-motor interventions were defined as dual-tasking, virtual reality exercise, cognitive exercise, or a combination of these.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight articles met our inclusion criteria. Three articles used an isolated cognitive rehabilitation intervention, seven articles used a dual-task intervention, and 19 applied a computerized intervention. The study provides important insights for future research in this domain.

### Statistical methodology for multiclass classifications: Applications to dementia [^1141rvTf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, devastating illness that carries a significant economic burden. There is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to identify presymptomatic stages of AD and biomarkers for classifying the disease. Currently, no biomarkers can perfectly discriminate individuals into the multiple disease categories of AD: no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Although many biomarkers for diagnosis and their features are being studied, advanced statistical methods are lacking. These methods could fully utilize biomarkers to classify AD accurately, facilitating the evaluation of putative markers both individually and in combination.

In this paper, we propose two approaches:

- **Forward addition procedure**: We adapt an additive logistic regression model to the setting of diseases with ordered multiple categories. Using this approach, we select and combine multiple cross-sectional biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy.

- **Method extension**: By extending the Neyman-Pearson Lemma to the ordered three disease categories, we construct optimal cutoff points to distinguish multiple disease categories.

We evaluate the robustness of the proposed model using a simulation study. These methods are applied to data from the Religious Orders Study to examine the feasibility of combining biomarkers. We compare the diagnostic accuracy between the proposed methods and existing methods, including model-based methods (ordinal logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis), a tree-based method (CART), and the Youden index method.

### Identifying mild behavioral and neurocognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MBNI-ALS) provides key prognostic insights [^117N8Zkv]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Clinical characteristics as a function of cognitive and behavioral impairments**: Characteristics of the sample, as well as their distribution based on the two cognitive classification systems, are detailed in Table 2.

	- **Clinical characteristics of patients according to the two cognitive classifications**: In more severe King's clinical stages, both the Strong classification and our approach showed a lower prevalence of CN and NC patients (Strong: χ² = 23.22, p < 0.001; MBNI: χ² = 8.65, p = 0.034), and a higher prevalence of FTD (Strong and MBNI: χ² = 17.51, p < 0.001). For intermediate categories, according to the Strong classification, CI, BI, and CBI were more frequently observed in patients with advanced disease stages [Figure 1A], whereas according to the MBNI approach, the proportion of MCI and MBI was higher in earlier stages, and MCBI was more prevalent in later stages [Figure 1B, p = 0.012].

	- **Cognitive and behavioral impairments across King's clinical stages using Strong classification and MBNI approach**: The frequency of cognitive and behavioral impairments across King's clinical disease stages was compared using the Strong classification and the MBNI approach. Chi‐squared tests were used to determine significance (p < 0.05). BI = behavioral impairment, CBI = combined cognitive and behavioral impairment, CI = cognitive impairment, CN = cognitively normal, FTD-dem = frontotemporal dementia syndrome and other dementias, MCBI = mild combined cognitive and behavioral impairment, MCI = mild cognitive impairment, MBI = mild behavioral impairment.

### Medial temporal lobe atrophy in predementia Alzheimer's disease: A longitudinal multi-site study comparing staging and A/T/N in a clinical research cohort [^1142FcNB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

To explore the impact of cognitive staging and biomarker classifications on future medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy, subjects were grouped according to two different classification algorithms: by cognitive staging and amyloid status, and by classification according to the A/T/N system. In contrast to A/T/N classification, clinical staging of subjects with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's Disease (AD) could be influenced by other non-AD related factors affecting cognitive reserve, such as premorbid function level, comorbidity, and education. Biomarker-verified AD biomarkers could also be pathological several years before the onset of clinical symptoms, and classification by the A/T/N system could also add information that otherwise would not be included in groups based on cognitive staging; these subjects would then fall outside AD classification based on clinical symptoms.

The groups based on cognitive staging and amyloid status were classified into the following categories: normal amyloid-negative controls (NC A–), amyloid-negative or positive subjective cognitive decline (SCD A– and SCD A+), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI A– and MCI A+). Due to power restrictions, we did not include amyloid-positive cognitively normal controls (NC A+) or cognitively abnormal amyloid-negative or positive controls (AC A+ and AC A–). Here, NC A– were defined as controls, and SCD A–, SCD A+, MCI A–, and MCI A+ as cases.

A/T/N staging was performed as follows: A–/T–/N– (biomarker-negative controls), A–/T+orN+, A+/T–/N–, and A+/T+orN+. According to A/T/N classification, A–/T–/N– was defined as controls, and A–/T+orN+.

### Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia [^117CiBYY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment, a defining feature of dementia, plays an important role in the compromised functional independence that characterizes the condition. Cognitive training (CT) is an approach that uses guided practice on structured tasks with the direct aim of improving or maintaining cognitive abilities.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of CT on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. To compare the effects of CT with those of other non-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive stimulation or rehabilitation, for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. To identify and explore factors related to intervention and trial design that may be associated with the efficacy of CT for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers.

- **Search methods**: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, on 5 July 2018. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up-to-date.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention.

### Diabetes and cognitive dysfunction [^112chVap]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction in type 1 and type 2 diabetes shares many similarities, but important differences do exist. A primary distinguishing feature of type 2 diabetes is that individuals with this disorder often, but not invariably, perform poorly on measures of learning and memory, whereas deficits in these domains are rarely observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Chronic hyperglycaemia and microvascular disease contribute to cognitive dysfunction in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and both disorders are associated with mental and motor slowing and decrements of similar magnitude on measures of attention and executive functioning. Additionally, both types are characterized by neural slowing, increased cortical atrophy, microstructural abnormalities in white matter tracts, and similar, but not identical, changes in concentrations of brain neurometabolites. Disconcertingly, the rapid rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes across all age groups might result in a substantial increase in the prevalence of diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction.

### Stroke impairment categories: A new way to classify the effects of stroke based on stroke-related impairments [^115T2itb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To create a classification system based on stroke-related impairments.

- **Data source**: All adults with stroke admitted for at least 72 hours in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from July 2013 to July 2015, extracted from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme.

- **Analysis**: Impairments were defined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores at admission. Common combinations of impairments were identified based on geometric coding and expert knowledge. The validity of the classification was assessed using standard descriptive statistics to report and compare patients' characteristics, therapy received, and outcomes in each group.

- **Results**: Data from 94,905 patients were extracted. The items of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (on admission) were initially grouped into four body systems: cognitive, motor, sensory, and consciousness. Seven common combinations of these impairments were identified (in order of stroke severity):

- Patients with loss of consciousness (n = 6034, 6.4%)
- Those with motor + cognitive + sensory impairments (n = 28,226, 29.7%)
- Motor + cognitive impairments (n = 16,967, 17.9%)
- Motor + sensory impairments (n = 9882, 10.4%)
- Motor-only impairments (n = 20,471, 21.6%)
- Any non-motor impairments (n = 7498, 7.9%)
- No impairments (n = 5827, 6.1%)

There was a gradation of age, premorbid disability, mortality, and disability on discharge. People with the most and least severe categories were least likely to receive therapy and received the least therapy (-20 minutes/day of stay) compared to -35 minutes/day of stay for the rest.

### The effect of non-pharmacological interventions on cognitive function in cancer: An overview of systematic reviews [^114cBKwG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

A significant number of cancer survivors experience cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), which can impact their ability to think, reason, make decisions, and perform daily actions. In recent years, non-pharmacological interventions for CRCI have gained significant attention. These interventions include exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy, cognitive training/remediation, dietary, mind-body, and multi-modal/complex interventions. This umbrella review provides a critical overview to inform guidelines and practice, identify the most promising interventions, and uncover gaps in the research literature.

This umbrella review of systematic reviews was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework and PROSPERO. Six databases were searched, and systematic reviews assessing any non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognition in cancer (any type) were included. The overview followed gold-standard guidelines and recommendations. The results were narratively synthesised, and descriptive statistics and effect size ranges were calculated.

Sixty-four systematic reviews were included.

- **Cognitive training/rehabilitation**: Had the strongest evidence for efficacy.

- **Physical activity/exercise**: Showed promising efficacy; however, the variability of findings was considerable.

- **Mind-body and psychological/behavioural therapy interventions**: Evidence was limited but indicated short-term effectiveness.

- **Multi-modal/complex interventions**: Showed potential for improving cognition in cancer.

### Vascular cognitive impairment [^1176p9BW]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). High credibility.

Vascular cognitive impairment can be associated with several conditions, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, memory impairment, atherosclerotic disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, mood changes, and cognitive impairment. Additional associations include cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, depression, peripheral artery disease (PAD), physical inactivity, tobacco use, coronary artery disease, elderly age, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

### Mild cognitive impairment [^115d7us4]. Lancet (2006). High credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment can be associated with several factors, including critical illness, APOE ε2/ε4 genotype, memory impairment, and diabetes mellitus. Additional associated conditions include cognitive impairment, inattention, difficulty concentrating, sleep disorders, and issues related to aging. It is also linked with anxiety disorder, hypertension, depression, and stroke. These associations underline the complexity and multifactorial nature of mild cognitive impairment.

### The international classification of functioning, disability and health and its application to cognitive disorders [^113yHmNG]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

This paper describes the conceptual foundation and systematic framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) as a mechanism for understanding the course and consequences of various health-related states, specifically with persons with cognitive dysfunction.

- **Method**: A comprehensive literature review related to the conceptualization of the ICF, its classification scheme, and coding process is presented. Information on cognitive disorders including prevalence, functional manifestations, and the assessment of a person's cognitive functioning and the applicability of the ICF's holistic classification and coding of cognitive dysfunction within the components of body structure and function, activity and participation, and environmental attributes is also reviewed.

- **Conclusion**: The ICF has the potential to classify and interpret cognitive deficits on a global level and thereby reflects upon the overall health and functioning of the individual in major life activities. The coding system systematically organizes measures related to the person's cognitive status and the resulting functional outcomes. The ICF focuses on individuals' performance of activities in all aspects of life and validates the independence and well-being of persons with disabilities, making it an important instrument to be used by rehabilitation professionals.

### Social cognition in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ytgxb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses to compare aMCI versus AD dementia, as aMCI is often considered a prodromal stage of AD dementia. Comparisons between aMCI and non-aMCI with other dementia subtypes were not possible due to the small number of studies reporting non-aMCI diagnoses and the small number of other dementia subtypes reported in the included studies.

We excluded studies from meta-analyses if dementia subtypes were not specified, if mean scores were unavailable, or if participants potentially overlapped with those in another included study; in such cases, the study with the larger sample size was included. A full list of excluded studies and their reason for exclusion is provided in Appendix C.

### ATN classification and clinical progression in subjective cognitive decline: The SCIENCe project [^111QnRXw]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

This study has important clinical implications. There is an increasing interest in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as a clinically relevant construct because these individuals often seek help at a memory clinic. We demonstrated that within SCD, the ATN classification is associated with clinical progression and cognitive decline at a group level. Although it originally emerged as a research framework, applying ATN to participants with SCD presenting to a memory clinic is a first step in evaluating the potential for translation of these criteria to clinical practice. Our results show that ATN biomarker profiles help identify which individuals with SCD are at risk of clinical progression. Just as important, the ATN classification can help avoid misjudging SCD as a group, because most individuals with SCD have normal biomarkers, and our results show that they are highly unlikely to exhibit cognitive decline over time.

This study has several major strengths. First, we included a large cohort with almost 700 participants with SCD. We had follow-up data for many, which enabled us to analyze dementia as an outcome in this initially cognitively normal sample. We used a combination of modalities to define ATN categories, resulting in a robust classification. Among the potential limitations of this study is the significant relationship between age and biomarker abnormality. Although we corrected for age in all models used, this might not have been sufficient to eliminate this factor. Second, despite having a large cohort, some groups were very small, which hampered the feasibility of certain analyses.

### Classification and diagnosis of dementia: A mechanism-based approach [^116c7TTt]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Dementia is an acquired disorder of the brain, designating an impairment of established mental functions due to various aetiologies, representing a decline from pre-morbid levels which is severe enough to impair normal daily functioning. Classification of dementias is commonly based on individual aetiological categories; more recently, molecular-pathological classifications have been proposed for degenerative dementias. This article is an attempt to provide a comprehensive, yet simplified, classification of dementias following a mechanism-based approach. A systematic approach to the diagnostic work-up is also proposed based on this classification.

### Two-year progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia: To what extent do different definitions agree [^113CGUzb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the 2-year outcome from 16 different classifications of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a population-based sample.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study with baseline and 2-year follow-up phases.

- **Setting**: Large-scale multicenter study conducted in the United Kingdom.

- **Participants**: The study involved 13,004 individuals aged 65 and older from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Of these, a subsample of 2,640 individuals underwent a more detailed cognitive assessment and were asked to complete annual or 2-year follow-ups.

- **Measurements**: Data on sociodemographic status, general health, cognitive impairment, and functional ability were collected using a structured interview. Individuals were classified according to 16 different definitions of MCI, which were applied retrospectively.

- **Results**: The primary outcome across definitions was an impairment that was not classifiable or a reversion to normality. The progression to dementia varied and was generally low. Overall progression was highest in classifications where impairment extended to both memory and non-memory domains. Predictability was age-dependent in some, but not all, classifications.

- **Conclusion**: Classifications of MCI show variable outcomes in population-based samples. Progression to dementia is relatively rare and depends on age and the specific definition used. Selection criteria developed for clinical settings are based on a "high risk" approach, often leading to the exclusion of a substantial percentage of the impaired population who are nevertheless affected.

### Consensus classification of posterior cortical atrophy [^113A2pLS]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Naturally, there are multiple ways of classifying clinical heterogeneity within the PCA spectrum. An alternative way to discriminate putative subphenotypes would be to refer exclusively to the organization of the visual system (e.g. ventral and dorsal streams). Certain presentations may also merit the combination of different types of descriptive terminology (e.g. prodromal occipito-temporal variant PCA). Descriptions of PCA variants may be relevant to brain-behavior studies, phenotype characterization work (e.g. clarifying the degree of homogeneity/heterogeneity within the PCA spectrum), and examinations of phenotype progression (e.g. establishing the order of loss of different aspects of cortical visual processing).

Descriptions of PCA variants may also be useful in the design and use of nonpharmacological interventions, aids, and strategies geared toward helping individuals with PCA cope with or ameliorate problems associated with a specific aspect of cognitive function (e.g. cues which aid object localization but not object identification). However, it should be stressed again that these descriptions are preliminary characterizations of positions within a spectrum of continuous variation.

### Identifying mild behavioral and neurocognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MBNI-ALS) provides key prognostic insights [^112Qdfq8]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In the Strong classification, 92 patients (46%) were classified as cognitively normal (CN), 36 patients (18%) as cognitively impaired (CI), 21 patients (10%) as behaviorally impaired (BI), and 22 patients (11%) as showing combined cognitive and behavioral impairment (CBI).

The present approach identified a relevant number of patients with early cognitive and behavioral impairments. In our cohort, 30 patients (15%) were classified as having normal cognition (NC), 31 patients (15%) as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 43 patients (21%), and 67 patients (33%) as having mild combined cognitive and behavioral impairment (MCBI). For both classifications, the frontotemporal dementia group included 30 patients (15%).

The Sankey diagram shows how most patients classified as CN under the Strong criteria showed mild cognitive and behavioral impairments according to the proposed framework (Figure 2).

- **Sankey diagram**: Comparing patient transitions between Strong classification and MBNI approach for cognitive and behavioral impairments in ALS. The Sankey diagram illustrates the distribution of ALS patients across cognitive and behavioral impairment categories, comparing the Strong classification on the left with the MBNI approach on the right. Patients classified as CN in the Strong system are distributed across NC, MCI, MBI, and MCBI in the MBNI approach. Similarly, CI, BI, and CBI in the Strong classification transition primarily to MCI, MBI, and MCBI in the MBNI approach.

### EFNS task force: The use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of dementia [^112KmHrz]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, particularly concerning brain imaging, the EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend including a high-resolution structural volumetric T1-weighted scan, transverse T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences, and transverse T2-star-gradient echo sequence in the standard MRI protocol. Routine contrast administration should not be used.

### Data-driven classification of cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment subtypes predicts progression in the NACC dataset [^1131LJD4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Data-driven neuropsychological methods can identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes with stronger associations to dementia risk factors than conventional diagnostic methods.

- **Methods**: Cluster analysis used neuropsychological data from participants without dementia (mean age = 71.6 years) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (n = 26,255) and the "normal cognition" subsample (n = 16,005). Survival analyses examined MCI or dementia progression.

- **Results**: Five clusters were identified: "Optimal" cognitively normal (oCN; 13.2%), "Typical" CN (tCN; 28.0%), Amnestic MCI (aMCI; 25.3%), Mixed MCI-Mild (mMCI-Mild; 20.4%), and Mixed MCI-Severe (mMCI-Severe; 13.0%). Progression to dementia differed across clusters (oCN < tCN < aMCI < mMCI-Mild < mMCI-Severe). Cluster analysis identified more MCI cases than consensus diagnosis. In the "normal cognition" subsample, five clusters emerged: High-All Domains (High-All; 16.7%), Low-Attention/Working Memory (Low-WM; 22.1%), Low-Memory (36.3%), Amnestic MCI (16.7%), and Non-amnestic MCI (naMCI; 8.3%), with differing progression rates (High-All < Low-WM = Low-Memory < aMCI < naMCI).

- **Discussion**: Our data-driven methods outperformed consensus diagnosis by providing more precise information about progression risk and revealing heterogeneity in cognition and progression risk within the NACC "normal cognition" group.

### EFNS task force: the use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of dementia [^116pRWaq]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend making a diagnosis of vascular dementia only where the vascular lesions can explain the cognitive deficit. Reserve the 'mixed dementia' label for cases where both clinical features and diagnostic markers point to a mixed etiology.
