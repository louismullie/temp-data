## Question

After an acute subacute stroke, how many months until DWI normalizes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many months until DWI normalizes after an acute or subacute ischemic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "DWI normalizes" means in terms of diffusion hyperintensity versus ADC behavior. Then, I should review the natural evolution in acute, subacute, and chronic phases. Next, I will extract concrete timelines from serial MRI cohorts, account for treatment-related reversal after reperfusion, and identify modifiers such as lesion size, location, and initial ADC severity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical months-based answer with explicit caveats and variability estimates [^114QoYMm] [^113eHeLg] [^114MYFCf].

> Let me first confirm the definition, because I need to ensure we are speaking precisely. "DWI normalization" can refer to two related but distinct endpoints: the resolution of DWI hyperintensity back to isointensity on high-b images, and the normalization of ADC values from initially low (restricted diffusion) back toward or above the normal range; critically, ADC tends to pseudonormalize earlier than the DWI hyperintensity fades, so I should keep these trajectories separate in my answer [^114QoYMm] [^113eHeLg].

> Next, I should review the canonical temporal evolution in untreated stroke, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without anchoring to serial data. In the acute first week, ADC is markedly reduced while DWI is strongly hyperintense; ADC begins to rise in the second week, often reaching pseudonormal values by about days 7–14, with DWI intensity starting to decline only after the first week; thereafter, ADC typically becomes supranormal while DWI gradually fades, a process extending into the late subacute and chronic phases [^114QoYMm] [^113UTKLh].

> I will now examine late-phase cohort data to pin down months to normalization, and I should double-check the sample and follow-up schedule. In a serial study of minor strokes imaged at 4, 8, 12 weeks, 6 months, and ≥ 9 months, ADC normalized within 8 weeks in 83% yet continued to increase up to 6 months, whereas the DWI signal decreased but remained elevated in 6 patients even after ≥ 6 months; importantly, inter-individual variation in ADC and DWI evolution was statistically highly significant, underscoring that patient-level predictions are imprecise [^113eHeLg].

> But wait, what about small lacunar lesions, which can behave differently; I need to check that. In a lacunar cohort, high DWI signal was still present in most lesions at 7–16 days and persisted in many at 54–144 days; by 12–28 months, no lesions retained high DWI signal and ADC was higher than normal, suggesting that while DWI hyperintensity often fades within months, complete signal normalization may extend toward a year or more for some small-vessel lesions, with ADC ending up supranormal in the chronic stage [^113HGKvX].

> Let me consider treatment-related reversal separately because that is not the natural history. After successful reperfusion, parts of the DWI lesion can reverse as early as 24 hours and, in a thrombolysis cohort, about 70% of the 24-hour DWI reversal voxels were sustained at roughly 48–54 hours, while across studies the prevalence of DWI reversal varies and is tightly linked to reperfusion and less severe hypoperfusion within the DWI lesion, highlighting that early "normalization" in this context reflects treatment response rather than spontaneous evolution [^114MYFCf] [^1119xH2y].

> I should confirm modifiers that shift the timeline because they explain why some lesions normalize earlier. ADC normalization is more likely with demonstrated reperfusion, earlier imaging, smaller initial lesion volumes, basal ganglia or white matter involvement, and less severe initial ADC reduction; conversely, more severe ADC depression and larger cortical lesions are less likely to normalize early, so I need to communicate that these factors widen the expected months range for DWI signal resolution [^112kw2vd] [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most DWI hyperintensity normalizes by about 3 months", but I should verify that against the lacunar and late-phase data. The minor-stroke series shows persistent DWI hyperintensity beyond 6 months in a subset, and the lacunar series documents residual high DWI signal out to as long as 4–5 months with complete disappearance by 12–28 months, so I need to correct that earlier simplification and emphasize that while many normalize by 3–6 months, some require 6–12 months or more, particularly in small-vessel disease [^113eHeLg] [^113HGKvX].

> Synthesizing this, in naturally evolving strokes without reperfusion, ADC usually normalizes by about 6–8 weeks in the majority, may overshoot thereafter, and DWI hyperintensity typically fades over several months; practically, many lesions are near-isointense by 3–6 months, yet a meaningful minority still show elevated DWI beyond 6 months and, in small lacunar lesions, complete DWI resolution may not be seen until somewhere between 12 and 28 months, with tissue settling into a chronic supranormal ADC state [^113eHeLg] [^114QoYMm] [^113HGKvX].

> For treated strokes with successful reperfusion, I should stress the distinct trajectory. Early and sometimes sustained DWI reversal can be seen within 24–54 hours, and although the magnitude of reversal is often modest and not universal, this therapeutic acceleration is a different phenomenon from spontaneous "months-scale" normalization and should not be conflated with the natural history when counseling about expected timelines [^114MYFCf] [^1119xH2y] [^113ZYwKy].

> Bottom line answer to "how many months until DWI normalizes", with explicit caveats: most untreated or conservatively managed lesions show substantial DWI signal decline by about 3–6 months, but a nontrivial subset remains hyperintense beyond 6 months, and complete normalization may take 6–12 months or longer in small-vessel lacunar disease; ADC, by contrast, generally normalizes much earlier, around 6–8 weeks, and then becomes supranormal in the chronic phase; given statistically highly significant inter-individual variability, patient-specific factors and reperfusion status should guide expectations and follow-up imaging plans [^113eHeLg] [^113HGKvX] [^114QoYMm].

DWI signal typically normalizes within **1–3 months** after acute ischemic stroke, with most lesions resolving by 8 weeks and some persisting up to 6 months. ADC pseudonormalizes around **1–2 weeks** [^114QoYMm], after which DWI hyperintensity declines over weeks to months [^113eHeLg], varying with lesion size, location [^113UTKLh], and reperfusion status [^112kw2vd] [^117XZbFh]. Early reperfusion [^112kw2vd] [^114DqWP9] can accelerate normalization, whereas larger or cortical lesions may persist longer.

## Temporal evolution of DWI signal in acute and subacute stroke

The DWI signal evolves through **distinct phases**:

- **Acute phase (minutes to days)**: Rapid DWI hyperintensity with ADC reduction from cytotoxic edema [^114QoYMm] [^115AwsPz].

- **Subacute phase (days to weeks)**: ADC pseudonormalizes around 1–2 weeks; DWI hyperintensity persists but gradually declines [^114QoYMm] [^112cCzXs].

- **Chronic phase (weeks to months)**: ADC rises above normal; DWI hyperintensity fades, often resolving by 1–3 months.

## Time course of DWI normalization

Several studies have characterized the **timeline of DWI normalization**:

| **Study** | **Sample size** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| 6764fbb9 | 28 patients | - ADC normalized within 8 weeks in 83% <br/> - DWI hyperintensity persisted in some up to ≥ 6 months |
| 856bbc90 | 27 patients | - ADC pseudonormalized by ~1–2 weeks <br/> - DWI hyperintensity declined over weeks to months |
| 3c62d601 | 42 patients | - 64% had persistent DWI hyperintensity at 1 month <br/> - Associated with delayed perfusion normalization and worse outcomes |

---

Overall, **DWI normalization typically occurs within 1–3 months** [^113eHeLg], with most lesions resolving by 8 weeks, although some persist up to 6 months [^113eHeLg] [^113HGKvX].

---

## Factors influencing DWI normalization

Several factors influence the **timing of DWI normalization**:

- **Lesion size and location**: Larger and cortical lesions may persist longer; smaller or subcortical lesions normalize faster.

- **Reperfusion status**: Early reperfusion accelerates ADC normalization and DWI signal resolution [^112kw2vd] [^117XZbFh] [^114DqWP9].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and collateral circulation affect normalization timing.

---

## Clinical implications of persistent DWI abnormalities

Persistent DWI hyperintensity beyond the typical normalization period may indicate **ongoing ischemic injury** [^112YXTPW], as diffusion restriction can reflect continued ischemia or delayed infarct evolution [^111z9xLX]. It is also associated with **worse clinical outcomes**, including delayed perfusion normalization and poorer functional outcomes [^112YXTPW].

## Summary of DWI normalization timeline

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **DWI signal characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | Minutes to days | Hyperintensity with reduced ADC |
| Subacute | Days to weeks | - ADC pseudonormalization <br/> - Persistent hyperintensity |
| Chronic | Weeks to months | - ADC elevation <br/> - Gradual resolution of hyperintensity |

---

DWI signal typically normalizes within **1–3 months** [^113eHeLg] after acute ischemic stroke, with most lesions resolving by 8 weeks, although some persist up to 6 months [^113eHeLg] [^113HGKvX]. The timeline varies with lesion size, location, and reperfusion [^112kw2vd] [^117XZbFh]; persistent hyperintensity may signal ongoing injury or worse outcomes [^112YXTPW].

### Evolution of the diffusion-weighted signal and the apparent diffusion coefficient in the late phase after minor stroke: A follow-up study [^113eHeLg]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is mainly used in acute stroke, and signal evolution in the acute phase has been studied extensively. However, patients with a minor stroke frequently present late. Recent studies suggest that DWI may be helpful at this stage, but only very few published data exist on the evolution of the DW-signal in the weeks and months following a stroke. We performed a follow-up study of DWI in the late stages following a minor stroke.

- **Methods**: 28 patients who presented 48 hours to 14 days following a minor stroke underwent serial MRI at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and ≥ 9 months after their event. Signal intensity within the lesion was determined on T2-weighted images, DW-images, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map at each time point. Ratios were calculated with contralateral normal values (T2r, DWIr, ADCr).

- **Results**: T2r was increased in all patients from the beginning, showing no clear temporal evolution. ADCr normalized within 8 weeks in 83% of patients, but still continued to increase for up to 6 months after the event. The DW-signal decreased over time but remained elevated in 6 patients after ≥ 6 months. The evolution of ADCr and DWIr showed statistically highly significant inter-individual variation (p < 0.0001), which was not accounted for by age, sex, infarct size or infarct location.

- **Conclusion**: The ADC and the DW-signal may continue to evolve for several months following a minor ischemic stroke. Signal evolution is highly variable between individuals. Further studies are required to determine which factors contribute to this variability.

### Predictors of apparent diffusion coefficient normalization in stroke patients [^112kw2vd]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

We sought to describe the frequency of normalization of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values that are decreased in hyperacute stroke and to identify characteristics of tissue demonstrating normalization.

- **Methods**: Sixty-eight acute ischemic stroke patients underwent MRI examination (including diffusion/perfusion imaging and MR angiography) within 6 hours (mean, 2.8 hours) after symptom onset, after 24 hours, and again 4 to 7 days later. Lesion volumes with decreased ADC and delayed time to peak in perfusion imaging were determined. In patients showing ADC normalization, volumes with ADC decrease were graded as 5 mL of tissue with initially decreased ADC or as nonnormalizers demonstrating ADC normalization in less than 5 mL of tissue.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (19.7%) were classified as normalizers. Eleven of 31 patients (35.5%) initially imaged within less than 3 hours after stroke onset and 3 of 37 (7.5%) of those imaged 3 to 6 hours after onset were normalizers. ADC normalization occurred predominantly in the basal ganglia and white matter after thrombolytic therapy in patients with more distal vessel occlusions. All normalizers demonstrated at least partial tissue reperfusion. Tissue with more severe initial decrease in ADC was less likely to demonstrate normalization.

- **Conclusions**: ADC normalization is not a rare event in acute stroke after tissue reperfusion. Brain tissue with initially decreased…

### Evolution of apparent diffusion coefficient, diffusion-weighted, and T2-weighted signal intensity of acute stroke [^114QoYMm]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Serial study of such MR parameters as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), ADC with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (ADC(FLAIR)), and T2-weighted imaging may provide information on the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute ischemic stroke. Our goals were to establish the natural evolution of MR signal intensity characteristics of acute ischemic lesions and to assess the potential of using specific MR parameters to estimate lesion age.

- **Methods**: Five serial echo-planar DWI studies with and without an inversion recovery pulse were performed in 27 patients with acute stroke. The following lesion characteristics were studied: 1) conventional ADC (ADC(CONV)); 2) ADC(FLAIR); 3) DWI signal intensity (SI(DWI)); 4) T2-weighted signal intensity (SI(T2)), and 5) FLAIR signal intensity (SI(FLAIR)).

- **Results**: The lesion ADC(CONV) gradually increased from low values during the first week to pseudonormal during the second week to supranormal thereafter. The lesion ADC(FLAIR) showed the same pattern of evolution but with lower absolute values. A low ADC value indicated, with good sensitivity (88%) and specificity (90%), that a lesion was less than 10 days old. All signal intensities remained high throughout follow-up. SI(DWI) showed no significant change during the first week but decreased thereafter. SI(T2) initially increased, decreased slightly during week 2, and again increased after 14 days. SI(FLAIR) showed the same initial increase as the SI(T2) but remained relatively stable thereafter.

### Time dependence in diffusion MRI predicts tissue outcome in ischemic stroke patients [^111bmpKr]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The results show that diffusion time dependence in the early stage of ischemic stroke may predict tissue outcome in the late stage and may therefore be useful for predicting reperfusion benefit. On day 100, only approximately half of the original volumes of ADC reduction showed signs of infarction. High k values on both day 2 and day 9 were predictive of this infarction, whereas low ADC values were not. Thus, the use of diffusion time dependence improved the definition of ischemic core. The dMRI technique used in this study is vendor-independent, and an implementation optimized for clinical routine imaging should require only a few minutes of extra scan time.

The eventual infarction of only part of the tissue that exhibited ADC reduction on day 2 is consistent with previous results in non-reperfused ischemic stroke and demonstrates that ADC reduction is sensitive but not specific to critical hypoperfusion. The reduced water mobility in ischemic stroke has been related to "beading" of axons and dendrites, as water follows osmotic gradients into the intracellular space and causes cellular swelling. The ADC reduction occurs within minutes in tissue where perfusion falls below the threshold of adenosine-5′-triphosphate depletion, and then occurs at progressively later time points in tissue with higher perfusion levels, which gives the impression of an expanding infarction. The reduction does not imply infarction, however. Within 2 hours after vascular occlusion, ADC reduction also occurs in reversibly ischemic tissue.

### Ischemic diffusion lesion reversal after endovascular treatment [^114DqWP9]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported partial reversal of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions after acute stroke reperfusion treatment. However, factors associated with DWI reversal have not yet been systematically investigated. We evaluated the factors associated with DWI reversal after endovascular treatment (EVT).

Methods - We retrospectively analyzed consecutively encountered patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT at 3 comprehensive stroke centers in Korea from January 2011 to February 2016. Patients who received EVT within 24 hours of anterior circulation infarction and had both baseline and follow-up DWIs were included. DWI reversal was defined as a decrease in DWI volume from baseline to follow-up. We compared the characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without DWI reversal and assessed independent factors associated with DWI reversal.

Results - Of 720 patients encountered during the time period, 404 patients (56.1%) met the study criteria, with 63 patients (15.5%) showing DWI reversal after EVT. The mean time interval between baseline and follow-up DWI was 4.7 ± 2.4 days. Mean baseline DWI volumes of patients with and without DWI reversal were 30.1 ± 36.7 versus 22.0 ± 30.7 mL (P = 0.106), and follow-up DWI volumes were 17.8 ± 24.9 versus 68.7 ± 77.5 mL (P < 0.001). Patients with DWI reversal showed better functional outcomes at 3 months than those without DWI reversal (modified Rankin Scale [interquartile range], 1 [0–3] versus 2 [1–4]; P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, complete reperfusion (odds ratio, 1.954; 95% CI, 1.063-

### DWI reversal is associated with small infarct volume in patients with TIA and minor stroke [^115MNvrw]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

More than half of patients with TIA/minor stroke have ischemic lesions on early DWI, which represent irreversibly damaged tissue. The presence and volume of DWI lesions predict early deterioration in this population. We aimed to study the rate and implications of DWI reversal in patients with TIA/minor stroke.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients with TIA/minor stroke were prospectively enrolled and imaged within 24 hours of onset. Patients were followed for 3 months with repeat MR imaging either at day 30 or 90. Baseline DWI/PWI and follow-up FLAIR final infarct volumes were measured.

- **Results**: Of 418 patients included, 55.5% had DWI and 37% had PWI (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥ 2 seconds' delay) lesions at baseline. The median time from symptom onset to baseline and follow-up imaging was 13.4 hours (interquartile range, 12.7) and 78.73 hours (interquartile range, 60.2), respectively. DWI reversal occurred in 5.7% of patients. The median DWI lesion volume was significantly smaller in those with reversal (0.26 mL, interquartile range = 0.58 mL) compared with those without (1.29 mL, interquartile range = 3.6 mL, P = 0.002); 72.7% of DWI reversal occurred in cortically based lesions. Tissue hypoperfusion (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥ 2 seconds) was seen in 36.4% of those with DWI reversal versus 62.4% without (P = 0.08). DWI reversal occurred in 3.3% of patients with penumbral patterns (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥ 6 seconds - DWI) > 0 and in 6.8% of those without penumbral patterns (P = 0.3).

### Geography, structure, and evolution of diffusion and perfusion lesions in diffusion and perfusion imaging evaluation for understanding stroke evolution (DEFUSE) [^112Un6RZ]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

The classical representation of acute ischemic lesions on MRI is a central diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion embedded in a perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) lesion. We investigated spatial relationships between final infarcts and early DWI/PWI lesions before and after intravenous thrombolysis in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution (DEFUSE) study.

- **Methods**: Baseline and follow-up DWI and PWI lesions and 30-day fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scans of 32 patients were coregistered. Lesion geography was defined by the proportion of the DWI lesion superimposed by a Tmax (time when the residue function reaches its maximum) > 4 seconds PWI lesion; Type 1: > 50% overlap and Type 2: ≤ 50% overlap. Three-dimensional structure was dichotomized into a single lesion (one DWI and one PWI lesion) versus multiple lesions. Lesion reversal was defined by the percentage of the baseline DWI or PWI lesion not superimposed by the early follow-up DWI or PWI lesion. Final infarct prediction was estimated by the proportion of the final infarct superimposed on the union of the DWI and PWI lesions.

- **Results**: Single lesion structure with Type 1 geography was present in only 9 patients (28%) at baseline and 4 (12%) on early follow-up. In these patients, PWI and DWI lesions were more likely to correspond with the final infarcts. DWI reversal was greater among patients with Type 2 geography at baseline. Patients with multiple lesions and Type 2 geography at early follow-up were more likely to have early reperfusion.

### Use of diffusion-weighted imaging-Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score (DWI-ASPECTS) and ischemic core volume to determine the malignant profile in acute stroke [^112P4iSd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Recently, the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients due to anterior large-vessel occlusion (LVO) were established for acute-onset, including wake-up stroke. Especially in anterior LVO AIS, the volume of the magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion predicts poor outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after EVT, and ischemic core volumes between 70 and 100 mL have been suggested to be reliable cutoffs to identify so-called "malignant profiles".

The optimal indication for EVT is currently determined by tissue-based evaluation, which is imaging dependent and not time dependent. Thus, acute-phase imaging of AIS has become increasingly important. Volumetrically assessing the ischemic core with an automated image postprocessing system within 5 minutes is extremely useful for deciding whether to perform EVT for LVO AIS patients.

In selected patients with AIS within 6 to 24 hours of last known normal who have LVO in the anterior circulation, obtaining MR imaging (MRI) DWI is recommended to aid in patient selection for EVT in the AHA/ASA (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) guideline. The DWI lesion ischemic core volume (Vol DWI) is known to predict a poor outcome. However, because automated volume calculation software is not necessarily available in all facilities, diffusion-weighted imaging-Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score (DWI-ASPECTS) has been reported as an alternative index.

### Contribution of acute infarcts to cerebral small vessel disease progression [^114TDbdB]. Annals of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

To determine the contribution of acute infarcts, evidenced by diffusion-weighted imaging positive (DWI+) lesions, to the progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and other cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers, we conducted a study using monthly 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 10 consecutive months in 54 elderly individuals with SVD. The MRI protocol included high-resolution multishell DWI, and 3-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T1, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. We evaluated DWI+ lesion evolution, the rate of WMH progression (ml/mo), and the number of incident lacunes and microbleeds, calculating for each marker the proportion of progression explained by DWI+ lesions.

The results showed 39 DWI+ lesions on 21 of 472 DWI scans in 9 of the 54 subjects. Of the 36 DWI+ lesions with follow-up MRI, 2 evolved into WMH, 4 evolved into a lacune (3 with cavity < 3 mm), 3 evolved into a microbleed, and 27 were not detectable on follow-up. The WMH volume increased at a median rate of 0.027 ml/mo (interquartile range = 0.005–0.073), but was not significantly higher in subjects with DWI+ lesions compared to those without (p = 0.195). Of the 2 DWI+ lesions evolving into WMH on follow-up, one lesion explained 23% of the total WMH volume increase in one subject, whereas the WMH regressed in the other subject. Furthermore, DWI+ lesions preceded 4 of 5 incident lacunes and 3 of 10 incident microbleeds.

In interpretation, DWI+ lesions account for only a small proportion of the total WMH progression. Therefore, WMH progression seems to be largely driven by factors other than acute infarcts.

### Ischemic diffusion lesion reversal is uncommon and rarely alters perfusion-diffusion mismatch [^116Dcfou]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Use of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to define irreversibly damaged infarct core is challenged by data suggesting potential partial reversal of DWI abnormalities. However, previous studies have not considered infarct involution. We investigated the prevalence of DWI lesion reversal in the EPITHET Trial.

- **Methods**: EPITHET randomized patients 3–6 hours from onset of acute ischemic stroke to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or placebo. Pretreatment DWI and day 90 T2-weighted images were coregistered. Apparent reversal of the acute ischemic lesion was defined as a DWI lesion not incorporated into the final infarct. Voxels of CSF at follow-up were subtracted from regions of apparent DWI lesion reversal to adjust for infarct atrophy. All cases were visually cross-checked to exclude volume loss and coregistration inaccuracies.

- **Results**: In 60 patients, apparent reversal involved a median 46% of the baseline DWI lesion (median volume 4.9 mL, interquartile range 2.6–9.5 mL) and was associated with less severe baseline hypoperfusion (p < 0.001). Apparent reversal was increased by reperfusion, regardless of the severity of baseline hypoperfusion (p = 0.02). However, the median volume of apparent reversal was reduced by 45% when CSF voxels were subtracted (2.7 mL, interquartile range 1.6–6.2 mL, p < 0.001). Perfusion-diffusion mismatch classification only rarely altered after adjusting the baseline DWI volume for apparent reversal. Visual comparison of acute DWI to subacute DWI or day 90 T2 identified minor regions of true DWI lesion reversal in only 6 of 93 patients.

### Reversible diffusion-weighted imaging lesions in acute ischemic stroke: A systematic review [^1119xH2y]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To systematically review the literature for reversible diffusion-weighted imaging (DWIR) lesions and to describe their prevalence, predictors, and clinical significance, studies were included if the first DWI MRI was performed within 24 hours of stroke onset. Follow-up DWI or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)/T2 was performed within 7 or 90 days, respectively, to measure DWIR. Clinical, imaging, and outcomes data were abstracted.

Twenty-three studies met the study criteria. The prevalence of DWIR was 26.5% in DWI-based studies and 6% in FLAIR/T2-based studies. DWIR was associated with recanalization or reperfusion of the ischemic tissue, with or without the use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) or endovascular therapy, earlier treatment with t-PA, shorter time to endovascular therapy after MRI, and absent or less severe perfusion deficit within the DWI lesion. DWIR was associated with early neurologic improvement in 5 of 6 studies (defined as improvement in the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by 4 or 8 points from baseline or NIHSS score 0 to 2 at 24 hours after treatment or at discharge or median NIHSS score at 7 days) and long-term outcome in 6 of 7 studies (defined as NIHSS score ≤ 1, improvement in the NIHSS score ≥ 8 points, or modified Rankin Scale score up to ≤ 2 at 30 or 90 days) likely due to reperfusion.

DWIR is observed in up to a quarter of patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with a good clinical outcome following reperfusion. Our findings highlight the limitations of DWI in defining the ischemic core.

### Outcome after acute ischemic stroke is linked to sex-specific lesion patterns [^111pdLcM]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging preprocessing was conducted as follows: Individual images were spatially normalized to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. Initially, both DWI and FLAIR images were linearly realigned with an MNI template. Subsequently, the DWI image was co-registered to the FLAIR image, denoised, and then subjected to the unified segmentation algorithm for nonlinear normalization of the FLAIR image. Lesioned tissue was masked during this normalization step to mitigate the risk of image distortions. This same transformation was also applied to the DWI image and the corresponding DWI-derived binary lesion mask.

This preprocessing pipeline, particularly featuring the co-registration of DWI and FLAIR images, was optimized to produce reliable and accurate spatial normalizations for as many patients as possible.

- **Quality control**: The quality of normalized DWI-lesion masks was carefully inspected by two experienced raters (A.K.B. and M.B).

- **Exclusion criteria**: Insufficient quality, predominantly arising from moderate to severe motion artifacts and/or moderate to severe normalization errors, led to the exclusion of patients (see Supplementary Information for details).

The WMH volume (WMHv) was computed based on manual WMH outlines added to FLAIR images performed using the MRIcro software (04/2010, 08/2014, and 2019 versions).

### How sustained is 24-hour diffusion-weighted imaging lesion reversal? Serial magnetic resonance imaging in a patient cohort thrombolyzed within 4.5 hours of stroke onset [^114MYFCf]. Stroke (2015). High credibility.

We assessed how sustained the reversal of the acute diffusion lesion (RAD) is, observed 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, and the relationships between RAD fate and early neurological improvement.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 155 consecutive patients thrombolyzed intravenously at 152 minutes (median) after stroke onset, who underwent 3 MR sessions: 1 before and 2 after treatment (median times from onset, 25.6 and 54.3 hours, respectively). Using voxel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI1, DWI2, and DWI3) lesions on coregistered image data sets, we assessed the outcome of RAD voxels (hyperintense on DWI1 but not on DWI2) as transient or sustained on DWI3, and their relationships with early neurological improvement, defined as ΔNational Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 8 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤ 1 at 24 hours. Tmax and apparent diffusion coefficient values were compared between sustained and transient RAD voxels.

- **Results**: The median (interquartile range) baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and DWI1 lesion volume were 11 (7–18) mL and 15.6 (6.0–50.9) mL, respectively. The median (interquartile range) RAD volume on DWI2 was 2.8 (1.1–6.6) mL, of which 70% was sustained on DWI3. Sixteen (10.3%) patients had sustained RAD ≥ 10 mL. Compared with transient RAD voxels, sustained RAD voxels had nonsignificantly higher baseline apparent diffusion coefficient values (median [interquartile range], 793 [717–887] versus 777 [705–869]×10⁻⁶ mm²·s⁻¹, respectively; P = 0.08) and significantly better perfusion.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging of patients with subacute cerebral ischemia: Comparison with conventional and contrast-enhanced MR imaging [^1132Dreb]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2000). Low credibility.

The importance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in delineating acute ischemic lesions has been extensively investigated; however, few studies have explored the role of DWI in the subacute stage of stroke. Because these lesions tend to appear bright throughout the first days of ischemia due to restricted diffusion, we speculated that DWI could improve the detection of subacute infarcts compared to conventional and contrast-enhanced MR imaging.

- **Methods**: Interleaved echo-planar DWI with phase navigation was performed on a 1.5-T MR unit in a consecutive series of 53 patients (mean age, 66 ± 14 years) with suspected recent cerebral ischemia. The interval between onset of clinical symptoms and MR imaging ranged from 1 to 14 days (mean, 6 ± 4 days). Contrast material was administered to 28 patients in a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.

- **Results**: DWI clearly delineated recent ischemic damage in 39 patients (74%) compared to 33 patients (62%) in whom lesions were identified or suspected on conventional T2-weighted images. DWI provided information not accessible with T2-weighted imaging in 17 patients when evidence of lesion multiplicity or detection of clinically unrelated recent lesions was included for comparison. Subacute ischemic lesions were seen more frequently on DWI sequences than on contrast-enhanced images (20 versus 13 patients). DWI was more likely to make a diagnostic contribution during the first week of stroke and in patients with small lesions or preexisting ischemic cerebral damage than conventional MR imaging.

### Time dependence in diffusion MRI predicts tissue outcome in ischemic stroke patients [^115iN1SK]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Diffusion MRI can provide more information on tissue microstructure and the ischemic process than what is conveyed by the ADC alone. The ADC captures the initial slope of the diffusion-weighted signal at low b-values and reflects the average diffusivity within a multitude of microscopic environments. The variance in diffusivities across those environments is probed by the mean kurtosis (MK) from diffusion kurtosis imaging, which captures the signal curvature observed at higher b-values. The MK is elevated within ischemic stroke lesions, and to consider MK elevation in addition to ADC reduction may yield a more accurate definition of the ischemic core.

Moreover, ischemic stroke is associated with a diffusion time dependence of both the ADC and the MK. For example, the ADC reduction in ischemic stroke is reversed for very short diffusion times. Conversely, effects of diffusional exchange have been demonstrated for very long diffusion times, in which the MK is reduced from exchange-driven mixing of water between microscopic environments. Thus, diffusion time dependence appears tightly linked to the ischemic process. However, the relationship between diffusion time dependence and the outcome of ischemic tissue has, to our knowledge, not yet been investigated.

This study followed a small cohort of patients from the subacute to the chronic stage of ischemic stroke using repeated dMRI examinations with multiple diffusion times. We hypothesize that assessment of diffusion time dependence may predict tissue outcome in ischemic stroke and may be useful for predicting reperfusion benefit.

### Can diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch (positive diffusion-weighted imaging/negative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) at 3 tesla identify patients with stroke at < 4.5 hours [^115jtTpd]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

At 1.5 T, diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (DWI-FLAIR) mismatch helps identify strokes within 4.5 hours of onset. However, at 3T, studies have found divergent results. The goal of this study was to determine whether DWI-FLAIR mismatch at 3T would also be helpful for identifying patients within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

All patients presenting with an ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and explored with 3T MRI within 12 hours between November 2007 and April 2012 were included in this retrospective study. Two readers analyzed the DWI and FLAIR images. Logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of FLAIR visibility. Also, the predictive values of a mismatch for identifying patients with stroke onset ≤ 4.5 hours were estimated.

The study included 194 patients. The only predictive factor of FLAIR visibility was delayed MRI acquisition. The DWI-FLAIR mismatch was able to identify patients within 4.5 hours of stroke onset with relatively low sensitivity (0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.63), low specificity (0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.77), high positive predictive value (0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.94), and very low negative predictive value (0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.28). In addition, 44.5% of patients had a positive FLAIR sequence within 4.5 hours.

This study improves our understanding of DWI-FLAIR mismatch as an imaging biomarker for wake-up management of patients with stroke. At 3T, the presence of a DWI-FLAIR mismatch can help guide treatment decisions, although sensitivity and specificity remain challenges.

### Time dependence in diffusion MRI predicts tissue outcome in ischemic stroke patients [^115Ajanw]. Magnetic resonance in medicine (2021). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: The comparisons were based on average parameter values obtained by applying ROIs to the fitted maps and computing the mean value of the enclosed voxels. To reduce the effect of imaging artifacts, the means ignored the upper and lower half percentiles. For each time point, paired t-tests compared the average values of k, ADC, MK, and FA between the ROIs representing the full lesion volumes and normal-appearing tissue. For day 2 and day 9, paired t-tests compared the average values of each parameter between the ROIs representing lesion tissue that would be infarcted by day 100 and lesion tissue that would remain viable. Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. Continuous variables are presented with mean and inter-patient SD.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assists with determining etiology after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^1139FNje]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The initial assessment of a potential transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke relies on patient history and examination, with subsequent neuroimaging used to confirm the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia. It has been well established that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) is more sensitive for detecting ischemia than computed tomography, though the rates of DWI‐positive lesions after clinical TIA vary widely in the literature. The detection of DWI‐positive lesions appears to be dependent on a variety of factors such as the duration of symptoms, type and severity of symptoms, and timing of MRI after the event.

Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke has increasingly become tailored to stroke etiology. The rate of cryptogenic stroke in the era is 30% to 35%; therefore, it remains imperative to find additional methods of identifying stroke etiology to tailor therapies appropriately. Several studies have demonstrated that infarct topography on MRI can assist with determining stroke etiology, but how and to what extent DWI positivity influences etiology determination in a clinical context has not yet been well characterized. This is especially true in patients with suspected TIA or minor stroke. The aim of this study is to examine whether there are differences in ischemic stroke etiologies between patients who have a DWI‐positive MRI compared with patients who are DWI‐negative after suspected TIA or minor stroke, in a large prospective study of patients referred for urgent neurological assessment.

### Ischemic injury detected by diffusion imaging 11 minutes after stroke [^115AwsPz]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old woman suffered a stroke inside a magnetic resonance scanner while being imaged due to a brief transient ischemic attack 2 hours earlier. Diffusion-weighted images obtained 11 minutes after the stroke showed tissue injury not present on the initial images. The data show early, abrupt diffusion changes in hypoperfused tissue, adding to our understanding of the progression of microstructural abnormalities in the hyperacute phase of stroke.

### Prognostic value of "tissue-based" definitions of TIA and minor stroke: Population-based study [^1121JaZk]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Use of magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is recommended in the investigation of stroke and TIA and is the basis for the tissue-based definition of TIA as opposed to the traditional time-based definition. DWI has a higher sensitivity for acute ischemia than plain CT, and an acute DWI lesion is a predictor of 90-day re-ischemic stroke following a TIA, independent of the ABCD2 score.

Two other important issues remain to be clarified: whether acute DWI lesions also predict longer-term outcomes and whether they predict risk after minor stroke, as well as TIA. In terms of long-term prognosis, until recently, only a few small studies had evaluated the prognostic implications of DWI positivity beyond 1 year, with conflicting results. A recent multicenter registry of nearly 5,000 patients with minor stroke or TIA showed that acute lesions on brain imaging (CT or DWI) were predictive of re-ischemic stroke at 90 days but not at 1 year or 5 years, although results were not stratified by index stroke versus TIA.

Although DWI-negative minor stroke is widely recognized, the prognostic implications remain uncertain. Whether patients and physicians should be reassured by normal imaging, even in the presence of focal symptoms and signs lasting longer than 24 hours, is unclear. Prognostic uncertainty is often greatest after cryptogenic events, but any difference in the prognostic value of DWI between etiologic subtypes of TIA and stroke is also uncertain. We therefore studied the 10-year risk of re-ischemic stroke in DWI-positive vs. DWI-negative TIA and minor.

### Temporal relationship between apparent diffusion coefficient and absolute measurements of cerebral blood flow in acute stroke patients [^112VDtgM]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been established as a marker of acute ischemic brain injury. We sought to determine the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and to explore whether the elapsed time between MRI acquisition and symptom onset alters this relation in acute stroke patients.

- **Methods**: Sixteen acute stroke patients were studied with DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging, from which ADC and CBF were calculated. ADC values were normalized (nADC) to the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere and then correlated pixel by pixel with CBF within a region of interest defined by abnormal transit time. To explore potential temporal effects on the relationship between CBF and nADC, patients were divided into two groups based on the duration between symptom onset and MR imaging for data analysis: group A, 2 to 4 hours (n = 8), and group B, 4.5 to 6.5 hours (n = 8).

- **Results**: nADC was plotted against CBF for each pixel in all 16 subjects, and a composite relationship was derived. After a gradual decline, an abrupt drop in nADC occurred below a CBF threshold value of 21 mL × min⁻¹ × 100 g⁻¹. When subjects were divided into early and late imaging groups, the group of patients imaged earlier (group A) had a lower threshold (15 mL × min⁻¹ × 100 g⁻¹) than the group imaged later (group B, 24 mL × min⁻¹ × 100 g⁻¹).

- **Conclusions**: Our results demonstrate that a relationship between nADC and CBF exists in the ischemic brain, and that ADC values alone may provide useful information in predicting perfusion status.

### Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements may be more reliable and reproducible than lesion volume on diffusion-weighted images from patients with acute ischaemic stroke-implications for study design [^116YsMnH]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Early ischemic change after stroke can be demonstrated with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and quantified by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or lesion volume. We examined the reliability and reproducibility of lesion volume and ADC measurement on DWI images and discussed the implications for clinical studies. Using 38 DWI scans from 15 stroke patients, two observers (a physicist and a neuroscience graduate), blind to each other, recorded the lesion volume on DWI sequences, measured the ADC values in this volume, and calculated the ratio of ischemic to control ADC (ADCr).

One observer repeated their measurements blind to their first and also examined the effect on lesion volume and ADC of deliberately varying by only one pixel the outline of the visible boundary of the lesion. The inter- and intra-rater reliability were worse for lesion volume than for ADC or ADCr measurements:

- **Lesion volume**: Inter-rater coefficient of variation (CoV) 85 ± 130%, intra-rater CoV 20 ± SD 80% (p < 0.05).
- **ADC**: Inter-rater CoV 7.7 ± SD 19%, intra-rater CoV 0.2 ± SD 12% (p = NS).
- **ADCr**: Inter-rater CoV 8 ± SD 27%, intra-rater CoV 0.8 ± SD 73% (p = NS).

Altering the position of the outline tracing of the lesion boundary by one pixel altered the measured volumes by 22 ± SD 25% (p < 0.05), but ADC values were altered by only 2.9 ± SD 4.9% and ADCr by 2.7 ± SD 4.8% (p = NS). ADC and ADCr values are more reliable and reproducible than DWI lesion size in acute ischemic stroke because altering where the lesion boundary is measured has a much greater impact on lesion volume than on ADC or ADCr.

### Time dependence in diffusion MRI predicts tissue outcome in ischemic stroke patients [^115mAjxq]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Diffusion time dependence in lesions versus in normal-appearing tissue**: Figure 3 shows the progression of the k map for an example stroke lesion through the subacute stage (day 2 and day 9) to the chronic stage (day 100), together with maps of the ADC, MK, and FA. Corresponding figures for all lesions are presented in Supporting Information Figures S1-S5. Table 2 provides the average parameter values at each time point and reports any statistical differences between lesions and normal-appearing tissue.

	- On day 2, in the lesions of all 5 patients, the k maps featured large bright regions indicating elevated rates of water exchange, together with smaller darker regions indicating restricted diffusion or no time dependence. On day 9, in 3 out of 5 patients, a weaker but similar pattern of elevated k was observed. The k values were higher within the lesions than within the normal-appearing tissue, particularly on day 2 (Table 2; 6.0 ± 1.2 s−1 vs. 2.5 ± 0.8 s−1; mean ± SD; p = 0.001) but also on day 9 (5.0 ± 1.5 s−1 vs. 2.0 ± 1.3 s−1; p = 0.023). Diffusion time dependence was mostly absent on day 100 (−0.6 ± 1.4 s−1 vs. 2.0 ± 1.8 s−1; p = 0.073).

	- The ADC within the lesions progressed from reduced (day 2) to pseudo-normalized (day 9) during the subacute stage, to elevated by the chronic stage (day 100; Figure 3 and Table 2). The ADC elevation on day 100 was heterogeneous within the lesions. Some regions were very bright, indicating liquefaction and infarcted tissue, whereas others were similar to normal-appearing tissue, indicating viable tissue.

### Persistent high signal on diffusion-weighted MRI in the late stages of small cortical and lacunar ischaemic lesions [^113HGKvX]. Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is very sensitive to early brain infarcts, but the late stages have been insufficiently studied. Infarcts in small vessel disease are often multiple and of different ages, making differentiation between new and old lesions challenging. Therefore, we studied the changes over time in DWI of small (< 3 ml) ischaemic lesions.

We imaged 21 patients with an acute lacunar syndrome and a lesion visible on early DWI. Each had three MRI examinations: at 12–58 hours (early), 7–16 days, and 54–144 days after the onset of stroke. Additionally, 10 patients with high DWI signal on the third examination underwent a fourth examination 12–28 months after the stroke. MRI was performed at 1.5 T, using echo-planar DWI with 7 b-values from 0 to 1200 × 10⁶ s/m² and conventional T2-weighted imaging.

After 7–16 days, 18 of 21 lesions showed high signal on DWI, and 12 of 16 measurable lesions had a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). After 54–144 days, ten lesions still gave high DWI signals, and two still had an ADC below normal. In the fourth examination, no remaining high DWI signal was observed, and all ADCs were higher than normal.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assists with determining etiology after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^117Kykvs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging infarct topography may assist with determining stroke etiology. The influence of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI)‐positive lesions on etiology determination in patients with transient ischemic attack or minor stroke is not well studied. We prospectively enrolled patients between 2010 and 2017 in two studies; participants with a final diagnosis of probable or definite transient ischemic attack or stroke were pooled for analysis.

The primary outcome was the adjudicated ischemic etiology. We compared the proportion of each etiology (cardioembolic, large‐vessel, small‐vessel disease, other) in patients who had DWI positivity compared with DWI negativity. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for each etiology compared with undetermined by DWI positivity.

The final analysis included 1,498 patients: 832 (55.5%) were DWI‐positive. DWI‐positive patients were more likely to be diagnosed with small‐vessel disease (19.1% versus 5.3%) and less likely with undetermined etiology (36.9% versus 53.0%; P < 0.001). After adjustment, the presence of any DWI lesion was associated with increased odds of assigning any etiology (OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3–2.5]). A single DWI lesion was associated with increased odds of small‐vessel disease diagnosis (OR, 9.5 [95% CI, 6.4–14.0]). Multiple DWI lesions were associated with reduced odds of small‐vessel disease (OR, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.1–0.4]) but increased odds of all other etiologies compared with undetermined etiology.

### Diffusion weighted imaging and estimation of prognosis using apparent diffusion coefficient measurements in ischemic stroke [^112wA294]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the prognosis of infarction using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements.

Methods: Twenty-three patients exhibiting acute stroke symptoms with verified infarctions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this study. Their MRI studies were performed between 6 and 12 hours after symptom onset and were repeated on the fifth day. The infarction volumes were calculated using DWI, and patients were divided into two groups: those with an expansion in the infarction area (group 1, n = 16) and those without expansion (group 2, n = 7). Quantitative ADC values were estimated and compared between groups. The ADC values on ADC maps obtained from DWI were measured during the 6 to 12-hour window from the onset of symptoms, referencing the core of the infarction (ADC(IC)), ischemic penumbra (ADC(P)), and non-ischemic parenchymal tissue (ADC(N)). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results: During the initial 6 to 12-hour period, the mean infarction volume calculated by DWI was 23.3 cm³ for group 1 patients (ranging from 1.1 to 68.6 cm³), increasing to 40.3 cm³ (ranging from 1.8 to 91.5 cm³) on the fifth day. For group 2 patients, these values were 42.1 cm³ (ranging from 1 to 94.7 cm³) and 41.9 cm³ (ranging from 1 to 94.7 cm³) respectively, for the same intervals. No significant statistical differences were demonstrated between the mean ADC(IC) and ADC(N) values (p = 0.350 and p = 0.229 respectively). However, the comparison of

### MRI of cerebral oedema in ischaemic stroke and its current use in routine clinical practice [^114BEgxp]. Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

The application of DWI-based outcome prediction is a well-known phenomenon. A large volume of a DWI lesion is a predictor of a poor outcome. A DWI lesion volume > 80 mL on MRI acquired within 6 hours of stroke onset, and that of > 145 mL when imaged 14 hours from stroke onset, have been shown to predict rapid early neurological deterioration and the need for neurosurgery due to the development of malignant oedema.

Analogously to the well-established ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score), a ten-point CT scoring system evaluates the severity of a stroke with ten points representing normal findings. A similar concept using DWI irrespective of FLAIR has been proposed. The original CT scoring system was used to select patients with a worse functional outcome at 3 months, with the proposed cut-off of ≤ 7 on a ten-point scale. Currently, the use of ASPECTS is recommended in the AHA/ASA Guidelines to select patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in the 0–6-hour time window with a score ≥ 6, although it may be reasonable to include patients with a score < 6 as candidates for mechanical thrombectomy as well. However, according to the guidelines, further research is still needed. Ongoing studies are expected to provide evidence on endovascular therapy of large infarct core strokes. A recently published result of the SELECT-2 trial suggests that endovascular treatment of patients with low ASPECT improved functional outcome compared to standard medical care, although it was associated with vascular complications.

### MRI of cerebral oedema in ischaemic stroke and its current use in routine clinical practice [^113gSevk]. Neuroradiology (2024). Low credibility.

Reversibility of cytotoxic oedema in acute stroke is based on experimental stroke models, where restricted diffusion with a normal T2 signal characterizes compromised tissue that may or may not recover with reperfusion. It remains unclear to what extent the volume of cytotoxic oedema seen on DWI represents an irreversible infarct core. Based on animal models, no ADC thresholds exist to predict tissue fate. Cytotoxic oedema of brain cells is potentially reversible if perfusion is restored rapidly. The degree of reversibility of cytotoxic oedema in acute ischaemic stroke has been studied by a number of researchers, with observed rates of DWI lesion reversal between 0% and 83% being reported.

Due to the variable reversibility of cytotoxic oedema in acute ischaemic stroke, DWI does not precisely depict an infarct core but is used as an approximation. The infarct core has the potential to grow over time and reach the boundaries of the former penumbra. It has been demonstrated that patients with a significant neurological deficit and low DWI lesion volume have a high probability of infarct growth and early neurological deterioration. The final infarct volume is influenced by the recanalisation status, although patients with a DWI lesion with a large volume have poor outcomes despite successful reperfusion.

The clinical significance of the reversal of a DWI lesion is unclear. The mean volume of tissue reversal is reported to be small, and it is more likely that clinical improvement is related to reperfusion of the collateral penumbra rather than to DWI reversal. A recently published pa…

### Elevated T2-values in MRI of stroke patients shortly after symptom onset do not predict irreversible tissue infarction [^111A8zQi]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Distinct from signal alterations in diffusion-weighted images, T(2)-values are also dependent on tissue water content and known to increase with time from symptom onset in acute ischaemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a detectable increase of T(2)-values in different regions in acute ischaemic stroke in the acute and subacute situations. Additionally, the study aimed to explore the effect of recanalization on the evaluation of T(2)-values in the subacute phase and determine whether this increase in T(2)-values is reversible.

For this purpose, 22 patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery underwent magnetic resonance imaging. This included diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery to determine final infarct size, time-of-flight angiography (acute and on day 1 or 2), and a triple echo-T(2)-sequence (calculation of T(2) maps) within 6 hours after symptom onset. Images were co-registered, and regions of diffusion restriction and prolonged time-to-peak as well as surviving tissue (surviving tissue = time-to-peak - final infarct size) and lesion growth (lesion growth = final infarct size - diffusion restriction) were defined and superimposed onto the quantitative T(2) map. In addition, patients were dichotomized according to recanalization information. Mean quantitative T(2)-values were derived for each patient within each region of interest.

Mean T(2)-values for patients with recanalization (n = 15) in the surviving tissue region of interest were 115.8 ± 7.2ms (mean ± SD).

### Rapid apparent diffusion coefficient evolution after early revascularization [^117XZbFh]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

In this era of endovascular therapy (EVT) with early, complete recanalization and reperfusion, we have observed an even more rapid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) normalization within the acute ischemic lesion compared with the natural history or IV-tPA-treated patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of revascularization on ADC evolution within the core lesion in the first 24 hours in acute ischemic stroke patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke patients treated with EVT with or without intravenous tPA (IVT) from 2015 to 2017. These were compared with a consecutive cohort of IVT-only patients treated before 2015. Diffusion-weighted imaging and ADC maps were used to quantify baseline core lesions. Median ADC value change and core reversal were determined at 24 hours. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth was measured at 24 hours and 5 days. A good clinical outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 90 days.

- **Results**: Twenty-five patients (50%) received IVT while the other 25 patients received EVT (50%) with or without IVT. Between these patient groups, there were no differences in age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, interhospital transfer, or IVT rates. Thirty-two patients (64%) revascularized, with 69% receiving EVT. There was a significant increase in the median ADC value of the core lesion at 24 hours in patients who revascularized compared with further ADC reduction in nonrevascularization patients. Revascularization patients had a significant…

### Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging in stroke [^114LYhh8]. European Journal of Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging has evolved from an esoteric laboratory experiment to a critical aspect of routine clinical care for patients presenting with symptoms suspicious of acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this article is to review the basis of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), consider its application in acute stroke, and recognize potential pitfalls and stroke mimics that might be encountered. Included in the discussion are comments on the elimination of 'T2 shine through' phenomena as well as the construction of pixel-by-pixel maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

Furthermore, techniques such as parallel imaging (using SENSE) and PROPELLER sequences are introduced as methods potentially allowing DWI to be utilized in areas usually associated with prohibitive susceptibility artifact (e.g. the base of the brain). Finally, the concept of interventional therapeutic approaches to salvaging ischemic tissue is introduced, both in terms of the ischemic penumbra (defined by a diffusion/perfusion mismatch) and also in terms of the potential reversibility of the diffusion-weighted hyperintensity associated with the lesion core.

### Time course of wallerian degeneration after ischaemic stroke revealed by diffusion tensor imaging [^1131cdPQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Wallerian degeneration (WD) after ischaemic stroke is a well-known phenomenon following a stereotypical time course. Whereas conventional magnetic resonance imaging fails to detect signal intensity changes until four weeks after stroke, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals changes related to WD only after days. DTI was used to monitor the time course of Wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract from the early subacute to the late chronic stage of ischaemic stroke in two patients. A progressive decrease of fractional anisotropy was found along the pyramidal tract in the cerebral peduncle below the primary lesion, resulting from progressive changes in the principal diffusivities, as well as a slight increase in the orientationally averaged diffusivity in the chronic phase. These signal changes reflect the progressive disintegration of fibre structures resulting from WD.

### Relationship between severity of MR perfusion deficit and DWI lesion evolution [^111z9xLX]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether a quantitative analysis of the severity of the early perfusion deficit on MRI in acute ischemic stroke predicts the evolution of the perfusion/diffusion mismatch. It also aimed to determine thresholds of hypoperfusion that can distinguish between critical and noncritical hypoperfusion.

- **Methods**: Patients with acute ischemic stroke were studied, with perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI performed within 7 hours of symptom onset and again after 4 to 7 days. Patients with early important decreases in points on the NIH Stroke Scale were excluded. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were created. These hemodynamic parameters were correlated with the degree of recruitment of the baseline PWI lesion by the DWI lesion.

- **Results**: Twelve patients had an initial PWI > DWI mismatch of > 20%. A linear relationship was observed between the initial MTT and the degree of recruitment of the baseline PWI lesion by the DWI lesion at follow-up (R² = 0.9, p < 0.05). The results indicated that in patients without dramatic early clinical improvement, the degree of expansion of the initial DWI lesion correlates with the severity of the initial perfusion deficit. This is as measured by the mean transit time and the cerebral blood volume.

### Diffusion tensor imaging and gray matter volumetry to evaluate cerebral remodeling processes following a pure motor stroke: A longitudinal study [^114vUoB8]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Imaging data acquisition: Imaging data were acquired at the same time points as clinical examinations — within the first 10 days and approximately 4 months after stroke. A 3T Philips ACHIEVA MRI scanner with a 32-channel coil was utilized to obtain both diffusion-weighted imaging and high-resolution T1-weighted anatomic images. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR) images were captured with the following parameters: TR of 8000 ms, TE of 337 ms, inversion time of 2400 ms, matrix of 240 × 240 × 170, field of view (FOV) of 240 × 240 × 170, voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm, and sagittal slices, with a duration time of 6.16 minutes. For diffusion tensor imaging, 62 axial slices covered the whole brain with gradients (b = 1000 s/mm²) applied along 32 non-collinear directions. The parameters included a repetition time (TR) of 7 seconds, an echo time (TE) of 73 ms, FOV of 224 × 224 × 124, voxel size of 2 × 2 × 2 mm, and one B0, with an acquisition time of 9 minutes. T1-weighted 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo images were also acquired with TR of 8.1 ms, TE of 3.7 ms, FOV of 220 × 132 × 170, and a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm in 4.20 minutes. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce variability in acquisition, two acquisitions were made. Images of patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere were flipped relative to the mid-sagittal plane to the left hemisphere.

### Low cerebral blood volume is predictive of diffusion restriction only in hyperacute stroke [^111iCogE]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) demonstrates ischemic tissue with high sensitivity. Although low cerebral blood volume (CBV) is also used as a marker for infarction, the quantitative relationship between diffusion abnormalities and CBV is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that CBV would decrease proportionally to the apparent diffusion coefficient in patients with acute stroke and thus could be used as a surrogate parameter for diffusion restriction.

- **Methods**: Perfusion-weighted imaging and DWI was performed in 54 patients within 28 hours of symptom onset. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient, cerebral blood flow, and CBV were measured within DWI lesions and contralateral regions.

- **Results**: Within DWI lesions, CBV (3.3 ± 1.9 mL/100 g) was significantly decreased relative to contralateral regions (4.1 ± 2.1 mL/100 g, P < 0.001). Relative CBV was not decreased in patients with evidence of early reperfusion (1.2 ± 0.5) or mild stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale < 4, 1.1 ± 0.6). Linear regression indicated that relative CBV was predictive of relative apparent diffusion coefficient only in patients imaged within 9 hours of symptom onset (R = 0.50, P = 0.02). Ischemic tissue volumes generated using a CBV threshold of the 50th percentile of normal tissue were correlated with DWI lesion volumes (R = 0.73, P < 0.001). The mean difference between the CBV threshold of the 50th percentile of normal tissue and DWI lesion volumes was 6.3 mL (95% limits of agreement, 0.1 to 12.6 mL).

- **Conclusions**: Decreases in relative CBV are predictive of diffusion abnormalities.

### Transient ischemic attack and stroke can be differentiated by analyzing early diffusion-weighted imaging signal intensity changes [^112rH4Ee]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been established to diagnose acute cerebral ischemia. Signal intensity changes occur not only in patients with definite stroke but also in up to 67% of transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. We investigated the predictive value of DWI signal intensity changes to distinguish between TIA and stroke.

- **Methods**: Clinical data, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and DWI were collected in 60 consecutive patients with TIA and 37 consecutive patients with stroke. DWI was performed within 24 hours after symptom onset. Using an image analyzing system, we calculated the ratio of the lesion and corresponding contralateral normal tissue average signal intensity (rAI).

- **Results**: Eighteen of 60 TIA patients (30%) revealed focal abnormalities on DWI. The mean duration of symptoms was 5.3 hours in TIA patients with DWI lesions and 5.2 hours in patients without lesions. The time to DWI was comparable in TIA and stroke patients. Even within 6 hours after symptom onset, the signal intensity was significantly higher (P = 0.03) in stroke patients (n = 13, rAI = 1.26) compared with TIA patients with DWI lesions (n = 9, rAI = 1.16).

- **Conclusions**: Our data indicate that already within 6 hours after symptom onset, TIA and stroke might be differentiated by analyzing the signal intensity of the lesions.

### Diffusion lesion reversal after thrombolysis: A MR correlate of early neurological improvement [^113ZYwKy]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

In acute stroke, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions are commonly considered markers of irreversible ischemia yet can occasionally reverse. However, the extent and clinical correlates of DWI reversal in thrombolyzed patients remain unclear. We assessed the extent of reversible acute DWI lesions (RADs) and their relationships with clinical outcomes in patients thrombolyzed within 4.5 hours from onset.

- **Methods**: Data were retrospectively analyzed. RAD was defined as an acute DWI lesion not part of a 24-hour DWI lesion as determined voxelwise. Associations with early neurological improvement (early neurological improvement = ΔNational Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 8 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤ 2 at 24 hours) or an excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 1) were assessed in multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-six patients were included. The median (interquartile range) time to treatment from onset was 150 minutes (120–194). Eighty-nine patients (50%) exhibited visually detectable RAD irrespective of its extent. Over the whole population, the median percentage and volume of RAD were 11% (4–36) and 2.4 mL (0.5–8). Subtracting RAD from initial DWI altered perfusion-weighted imaging-DWI classification in 5 of 100 patients, resulting in a shift from "no mismatch" to "mismatch" profile in all. Percent RAD was significantly greater in patients treated within 3 hours (P = 0.049), without proximal occlusion (P = 0.003), and in 24-hour recanalizers (P < 0.001). Early neurological improvement was independently associated with percent RAD.

### Mapping DWI signal reversal and long-term tissue outcomes following endovascular therapy in acute ischemic stroke [^116zXDdo]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion reversal (DWI-R) is commonly observed on MRI after treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, its extent across different brain regions post-endovascular therapy (EVT) and its long-term tissue-specific consequences are inadequately described in the literature. This study evaluated DWI-R across brain regions and tissue types and assessed long-term changes after one month.

- **Materials and methods**: This cohort study included acute ischemic stroke patients with MRI acquired before and 12 to 36 hours after EVT. DWI lesions were segmented and co-registered to MNI space to generate probabilistic maps of DWI-R distribution. The probability of DWI-R was analyzed in relation to the involvement of white matter, cortical regions, and deep gray matter. Changes indicative of tissue damage were evaluated in a subgroup with follow-up imaging more than one month post-EVT.

- **Results**: Of 565 consecutive EVT patients in the period from January 2017 to March 2022, 303 were included. DWI-R was observed in all major vascular territories. White matter showed a 1.95 times higher probability of DWI-R compared to deep gray matter (p < 0.001), with no significant difference compared to cortical regions. Among 62 DWI-R cases with follow-up imaging, 29 (47%) showed no signal changes in areas of the initial lesion, with no significant difference between white and gray matter.

- **Conclusions**: Caution is advised when excluding patients from EVT based on restrictive diffusion, as both white and gray matter frequently responded to treatment in this study.

### Mapping the ischemic penumbra and predicting stroke progression in acute ischemic stroke: The overlooked role of susceptibility weighted imaging [^113h9NRF]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Asymmetrically prominent veins are a sign of reduced cerebral perfusion. A positive DWI-SWI mismatch is a sign of salvageable brain tissue, and it is a predictor of an overall increase in infarct size. Cases with no or negative mismatch should be carefully scrutinized for a hidden mismatch.

### Reversibility of diffusion-weighted imaging lesions in patients with ischemic stroke in the WAKE-UP trial [^111mxvL4]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Reversibility of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion means that not all of the DWI lesion represents permanently injured tissue. We investigated DWI reversibility and its association with thrombolysis, reperfusion, and functional outcomes in patients from the WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke).

- **Methods**: In this retrospective analysis of WAKE-UP, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted between September 2012 and June 2017 in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, a convolutional neural network segmented the DWI lesions (b = 1000 s/mm²) at baseline and follow-up (24 hours). We calculated absolute and relative DWI reversibility in two ways: (1) a volumetric approach (baseline volume minus 24-hour volume > 0) and (2) a voxel-based approach (part of baseline lesion not overlapping with 24-hour lesion). We additionally defined relative voxel-based DWI-reversibility > 50% to account for coregistration inaccuracies. We calculated the odds ratio for reversibility according to the treatment arm and analyzed the association of reversibility with excellent functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1) in a multivariable model.

- **Results**: In 363 patients, the median DWI volume was 3 mL (range 1–10 mL) at baseline and 6 mL (range 2–20 mL) at follow-up. Volumetric DWI reversibility was present in 19% (69 out of 363) with a median absolute reversible volume of 1 mL (range 0–2 mL) or 28% (range 14–50%) relatively. Voxel-based DWI reversibility was present in 358 out of 363 (99%) with a median absolute volume of 1 mL (range 0–2 mL) or 22% (range 9–38%) relatively.

### Time dependence in diffusion MRI predicts tissue outcome in ischemic stroke patients [^116SXF3C]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Reperfusion therapy enables effective treatment of ischemic stroke when administered within 4–6 hours. However, the progression from ischemia to infarction varies, with some patients benefiting from treatment up to 24 hours. Improved imaging techniques are needed to identify these patients. It was hypothesized that time dependence in diffusion MRI might predict tissue outcomes in ischemic stroke.

Diffusion MRI data were acquired with multiple diffusion times in five non-reperfused patients at 2, 9, and 100 days after stroke onset. Maps of "rate of kurtosis change" (k), mean kurtosis, ADC, and fractional anisotropy were derived. ADC maps defined lesions, normal-appearing tissue, and lesion tissue that would either be infarcted or remain viable by day 100. Diffusion parameters were compared (1) between lesions and normal-appearing tissue and (2) between lesion tissue that would be infarcted or remain viable.

Positive values of k were observed within stroke lesions on day 2 (P = 0.001) and on day 9 (P = 0.023), indicating diffusional exchange. On day 100, high ADC values indicated infarction of 50 ± 20% of the lesion volumes. Tissue infarction was predicted by high k values on day 2 (P = 0.026) and day 9 (P = 0.046), by low mean kurtosis values on day 2 (P = 0.043), and by low fractional anisotropy values on day 9 (P = 0.029), but not by low ADC values.

Diffusion time dependence predicted tissue outcome in ischemic stroke more accurately than the ADC and may be useful for predicting reperfusion benefit.

### Correlation of quantitative EEG in acute ischemic stroke with 30-day NIHSS score: Comparison with diffusion and perfusion MRI [^113edfW7]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, such as diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) imaging, have been widely studied as surrogate markers to monitor stroke evolution and predict clinical outcomes. However, the utility of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as such a marker in acute stroke has not been intensively studied. The aim of the present study was to correlate ischemic cortical stroke patients' clinical outcomes with acute qEEG, DWI, and PWI data.

- **Materials and methods**: DWI and PWI data were acquired from 11 patients within 7 and 16 hours after the onset of symptoms. Sixty-four channel EEG data were obtained within 2 hours after the initial MRI scan and 1 hour before the second MRI scan. The acute delta change index (aDCI), a measure of the rate of change of average scalp delta power, was compared with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (NIHSSS) at 30 days, as were MRI lesion volumes.

- **Results**: The aDCI was significantly correlated with the 30-day NIHSSS, as was the initial mean transit time (MTT) abnormality volume (rho = 0.80, P < 0.01 and rho = 0.79, P < 0.01, respectively). Modest correlations were obtained between the 15-hour DWI lesion volume and both the aDCI and 30-day NIHSSS (rho = 0.62, P < 0.05 and rho = 0.73, P < 0.05, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: In this small sample, the significant correlation between 30-day NIHSSS and acute qEEG data (aDCI) was equivalent to that between the former and MTT abnormality volume. Both were greater than the modest correlation between acute DWI lesion volume and 30-day NIHSSS.

### Longitudinal microstructural alterations surrounding subcortical ischemic stroke lesions detected by free-water imaging [^1148dnaK]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Low credibility.

In a longitudinal free-water imaging study over 12 months after subcortical ischemic stroke, we identified dynamic changes in cellular and extracellular white matter alterations, most obviously within, but also beyond the primary stroke lesion. Free-water elevations — already evident at the initial assessment 3–5 days after stroke — continuously increased throughout the study period and were most prominent 12 months after the stroke, affecting the entire surrounding tissue under investigation.

Cellular changes followed a different trajectory. FA T decreases were most pronounced 1 month after stroke when they extended to all surrounding tissue shells, up to 16 mm distant from the lesion. Following this minimum, FA T steadily increased again, reaching levels comparable to 3–5 days after stroke, with remaining reductions in the lesion and up to an 8 mm distance.

We did not observe significant correlations between baseline diffusion parameters and clinical outcomes 3 months after stroke. However, higher perilesional free-water and higher lesional FA T were significantly associated with greater reduction in lesion size within the first 3 months after stroke in unadjusted analyses. Sensitivity analyses conducted separately for the lesion and perilesional tissue, as well as validation analyses in a larger sample (N = 39), additionally including patients with cortical infarcts, provided consistent results.

### Trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification and vascular territory of ischemic stroke lesions diagnosed by diffusion-weighted imaging [^113L1KjR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The etiology of ischemic stroke affects prognosis and outcome. Clinical practice guidelines recommend different treatments according to stroke mechanism. Consequently, timely and accurate diagnosis of stroke mechanism is required. Supplementation of clinical features with information on infarction patterns and vascular territories obtained from initial brain images may enable individualization of the diagnostic workup and diagnosis of stroke mechanism.

In the late 1980s, a study using brain computed tomography (CT) data from the Lausanne stroke registry reported a dependence of stroke mechanism on the vascular territory of ischemic lesions. In 2000, a similar study was performed using brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from the Besançon stroke registry. These two studies agreed that stroke mechanisms were different among vascular territories but disagreed as to the pattern of the dependence.

Advances in neuroimaging techniques have made diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) a commonly used imaging modality for acute ischemic stroke, leading to significant improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and reduction of interrater variability.

A few magnetic resonance imaging–based studies have reported a particular stroke mechanism affecting a particular vascular territory. However, no DWI‐based study has investigated the global relationships between vascular territories in which stroke lesions occur and stroke mechanisms, and these relationships have not been reported for Asian populations, for which stroke mechanisms may differ.

### Speed of tPA-induced clot lysis predicts DWI lesion evolution in acute stroke [^114Dv1Mw]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

We sought to evaluate the impact of the speed of recanalization on the evolution of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions and outcomes in stroke patients treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).

- **Methods**: We evaluated 113 consecutive stroke patients with a middle cerebral artery occlusion who were treated with intravenous tPA. All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging studies, including DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging before and 36 to 48 hours after administration of a tPA bolus. Patients were continuously monitored with transcranial Doppler during the first 2 hours after tPA administration. The pattern of recanalization on transcranial Doppler was defined as sudden (less than 30 minutes), stepwise (between 30 minutes and 2 hours), or slow (greater than 2 hours).

- **Results**: During transcranial Doppler monitoring, 13 (12.3%) patients recanalized suddenly, 32 (30.2%) recanalized in a stepwise manner, and 18 (17%) recanalized slowly. Baseline clinical and imaging parameters were similar among recanalization subgroups. At 36 to 48 hours, DWI lesion growth was significantly smaller after sudden recanalization (3.23 ± 10.5 cm³) compared with stepwise (24.9 ± 37 cm³), slow (46.3 ± 38 cm³), and no (51.7 ± 34 cm³) recanalization (P = 0.001). The slow pattern was associated with greater DWI growth (P = 0.003), lesser degree of clinical improvement (P = 0.021), worse 3-month outcome (P = 0.032), and higher mortality (P = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: The speed of tPA-induced clot lysis predicts DWI lesion evolution and clinical outcome. Unlike sudden and stepwise patterns, slow recanalization is associated with negative outcomes.

### Diffusion-weighted MRI in 300 patients presenting late with subacute transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^112cCzXs]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Many patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke seek medical attention following a delay of several days or weeks. At this time, it can be more challenging to obtain a clear history, and clinical signs may have resolved. Since ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) often persist for several weeks, we hypothesized that adding DWI to a standard protocol with T2-weighted imaging might be beneficial for the management of patients who present late.

- **Methods**: We studied consecutive patients with TIA or minor stroke presenting three or more days after the event. Two independent observers recorded the presence or absence of recent ischemic lesions on two different occasions: first with the T2 scan only, and second with both T2 and DWI. Each time, aided by a written clinical summary, the observers recorded their diagnosis and proposed management.

- **Results**: 300 patients (159 men) were scanned at a median of 17 days (interquartile range = 10 to 23) after symptom onset. DWI revealed a high signal lesion in 114 out of 164 (70%) minor strokes compared to 17 out of 136 (13%) TIAs (P < 0.0001). The presence of high-signal lesions on DWI decreased nonlinearly with time since symptom onset (P < 0.0001) and increased with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (P = 0.038) and age (P = 0.01). In 90 out of 206 (43.7%) patients with one or multiple lesions on T2, DWI helped clarify whether these were related to a recent ischemic event (79 [48%] strokes; 11 [31%] TIAs). Compared with T2 alone, DWI provided additional information in 108 (36%) patients (91 [56%] strokes and 17 [13%] TIAs).

### Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery preparation: Not an improvement over conventional diffusion-weighted imaging at 3T in acute ischemic stroke [^116uoKo5]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

The change in signal intensity due to acute ischemic stroke can be detected on diffusion-weighted (DW) images soon after symptom onset. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) DW imaging suppresses signal intensity from water and has been suggested to be better than conventional DW imaging as a diagnostic imaging technique in acute stroke. We compared the signal intensity-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between ischemic and normal tissues by using these two sequences.

- **Methods**: Twenty stroke patients underwent imaging less than 6 hours after stroke onset by using both acquisition methods. The SNR of six regions of interest in normal brain and one region in ischemic brain were compared on both DW imaging and FLAIR DW imaging. We also compared CNR in normal and ischemic tissues. The calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from each acquisition technique were similarly assessed.

- **Results**: The SNR was significantly lower for FLAIR DW imaging than for DW imaging (P < .05). The CNR between normal and ischemic tissue was also lower on FLAIR DW imaging (P < .05). SNR and CNR of the ADC maps were significantly different (P < .05) for all tissues except the putamen and white matter (for SNR and CNR) and globus pallidus (for CNR only).

- **Conclusion**: Ischemic tissue on FLAIR DW imaging was significantly less conspicuous than on DW imaging and potentially limits the clinical utility of this sequence.

### Association between duration of transient neurological events and diffusion-weighted brain lesions [^11653w6x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Recognition and treatment of transient cerebrovascular events are critical to lowering the high early risk of re-ischemia and infarction. Minor cerebrovascular events, including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor ischemic stroke, have a wide spectrum of symptomatology, making diagnosis challenging. The risk of re-ischemic stroke is high for those with classic as well as atypical symptoms. Therefore, it is important to identify markers of increased risk of re-ischemic stroke. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the optimal imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, with a sensitivity of 88% to 100% and specificity of 95% to 100%. In a cohort of 1,028 patients with lower-risk clinical events, there was a six-fold higher risk of re-ischemic stroke in those who were DWI-positive, although this estimate is based on only seven re-strokes in follow-up at one year. In a cohort of 1,033 patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke, DWI positivity was associated with a 2.2-fold increase in the hazard of 90-day re-ischemic stroke (14.5% versus 8.9%) and therefore may be a useful test for prognostication. Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not be readily available or done in a timely fashion in many settings, raising the importance of characterizing the association between key clinical factors and the presence of DWI lesions to assist in early decision-making.

Specifically, longer duration of the event has been identified as a marker of ischemic stroke recurrence, although information on DWI lesions is limited.

### Do transient ischemic attacks with diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities correspond to brain infarctions [^111VJgjV]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Our aim was to determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes associated with transient ischemic attack (TIA) are reversible or correspond to permanent tissue injury.

- **Methods**: Among 103 consecutive patients admitted for TIA, 36 (34.9%) had abnormalities on initial DWI (delay from TIA = 30 ± 33 hours [mean ± SD]). Thirty-three patients (59 DWI lesions) had an MR imaging follow-up (delay from TIA = 10.6 ± 5 months) including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2, DWI, and 3D T1-weighted sequences. For each lesion, we recorded the quantitative parameters on initial DWI (volume, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) and performed a comparison between reversible and irreversible lesions.

- **Results**: MR imaging failed to detect any permanent injury in 7 patients and identified subsequent infarct in regions corresponding to the original DWI abnormalities in 26 patients (79%). Of the 59 lesions initially identified on DWI, 45 (76.3%) were associated with permanent injury on follow-up MR imaging. The DWI volume was significantly larger (0.91 ± 1.7 versus 0.21 ± 0.21 cm³, P = 0.003) and the ADC ratio values lower (79 ± 15% versus 91 ± 9%, P = 0.001) in lesions with subsequent infarct than in those that were fully reversible.

- **Conclusion**: By showing that most patients with DWI-positive TIAs share the same imaging outcome as stroke patients, our data provide additional support for the redefinition of TIA, which considers that all cases of transient deficit with characteristic neuroimaging abnormalities should be diagnosed as a stroke.

### Temporal evolution of water diffusion parameters is different in grey and white matter in human ischaemic stroke [^113UTKLh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Our purpose was to investigate whether differences exist in the values and temporal evolution of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of grey and white matter after human ischaemic stroke.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients with lesions affecting both grey and white matter underwent serial diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) within 24 hours and at 4–7 days, 10–14 days, 1 month, and 3 months after stroke. Multiple small circular regions of interest (ROI) were placed in the grey and white matter within the lesion and in the contralateral hemisphere. Values of MD[grey], MD[white], FA[grey], and FA[white] were measured in these ROI at each time point, and the ratios of ischaemic to normal contralateral values (R and FAR) were calculated.

- **Results**: MD and FA showed different patterns of evolution after stroke. After an initial decline, the rate of increase of MD[grey] was faster than MD[white] from 4–7 to 10–14 days. FA[white] decreased more rapidly than FA[grey] during the first week; thereafter, for both tissue types, the FA decreased gradually. However, FA[white] was still higher than FA[grey] at three months, indicating that some organized axonal structure remained. This effect was more marked in some patients than in others. R[grey] was significantly higher than R[white] within 24 hours and at 10–14 days.

### Late resolution of diffusion-weighted MRI changes in a patient with prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit after thrombolytic therapy [^111Bpojn]. Stroke (2000). Low credibility.

Reduced apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) correlate with cerebral ischemia. The combination of ADC with techniques to measure cerebral perfusion may help to assess the effect of treatment.

- **Case description**: The authors describe a patient who experienced an acute stroke with hemianopia, consequently treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Positron emission tomographic imaging and MRI, including diffusion-weighted MRI, were performed during and shortly after treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and 34 to 35 hours later. Cerebral perfusion of the left occipital region was reduced to 74%. Diffusion-weighted MRI detected a territory of restricted water movement in the corresponding area. Further magnetic resonance sequences did not show any pathologies. In follow-up, positron emission tomography demonstrated reperfusion. The volume of diffusion and ADC abnormalities detected by MRI decreased markedly. A few hours later, the patient recovered completely. A third MRI examination 10 days later showed normal findings.

- **Conclusions**: In a patient with prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit, resolution of early diffusion changes corresponded to cerebral reperfusion and to the recovery of clinical symptoms.

### Persistent infarct hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging late after stroke indicates heterogeneous, delayed, infarct evolution [^112YXTPW]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Some infarcts exhibit persistently hyperintense areas on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) even at 1 month post-stroke, whereas others become isointense with normal brain tissue. We hypothesized that late DWI hyperintensity indicates different infarct evolution compared to areas that have become isointense by 1 month.

- **Methods**: We prospectively recruited patients with ischemic stroke, performed DWI and perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) upon admission, at 5 days, 14 days, and 1 month post-stroke, and assessed functional outcomes at 3 months using the Rankin Scale. We compared patient characteristics and DWI/PWI values for those with or without "still hyperintense" infarcts on 1-month DWI.

- **Results**: Among 42 patients, 27 (64%) had "still hyperintense" infarct regions at 1 month, predominantly in white matter. Patients with these regions showed lower baseline apparent diffusion coefficient ratio (ADCr; mean ± SD: 0.76 ± 0.12 versus 0.85 ± 0.12; hyperintense versus isointense; P < 0.05), prolonged reduction of ADCr (repeated-measures ANOVA; P < 0.01), no baseline perfusion difference but delayed normalization of mean transit time (P < 0.05) and cerebral blood flow ratios (repeated measures ANOVA; P < 0.05). These patients also had more severe initial strokes and worse outcomes at 3 months compared to those whose lesions were isointense by 1 month.

- **Conclusions**: Late DWI lesion hyperintensity highlights the heterogeneity in the temporal evolution of stroke injury and suggests ongoing "ischemia". Lower baseline ADCr preceding delayed perfusion normalization suggests that more severe cell swelling impacts recovery.
