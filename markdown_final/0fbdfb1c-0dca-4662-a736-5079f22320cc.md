test for gout

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test for suspected gout and confirm the diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic gold standard and when to prioritize synovial fluid crystal analysis. Then, I should verify how to estimate pretest probability and decide when to aspirate. Next, I will evaluate what to do if aspiration is not feasible, including the role and performance of ultrasound and dual-energy CT. After that, I should consider how to apply classification criteria when testing is unavailable. I will also need to interpret serum urate correctly, think about special populations and additional screening, keep key differentials in mind, and finally integrate these into a practical algorithm while noting pitfalls and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the gold standard. Identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or tophus material remains the definitive diagnostic test and is a sufficient criterion in the ACR/EULAR 2015 classification criteria, meaning no additional scoring is required once crystals are seen, which I should not forget even if the clinical picture seems obvious [^111wF2ys] [^115zUPTE] [^111cXdw2]. Hold on, I should verify practical limitations: this requires aspiration, a polarized microscope, and trained personnel; the ACP guideline advises synovial fluid analysis when testing is needed based on clinical judgment, but acknowledges the low-quality evidence and feasibility issues, so I need to balance accuracy with access in real-world settings [^111NWXYW] [^111cXdw2].

> Next, I will assess pretest probability and decide whether to aspirate now. I need to check for classic features that increase the likelihood of gout: male sex, monoarticular podagra or ankle involvement, rapid onset to severe pain and swelling within 24 hours, erythema, prior similar episodic attacks, hyperuricemia, and cardiovascular comorbidities; if feasible and safe, I should proceed to arthrocentesis to confirm crystals, given EULAR's preference for synovial fluid analysis in suspected gout and the admonition to include gout in the differential of any acute arthritis in adults [^116XCZDk] [^113MrCC1] [^113jCzmB]. Wait, let me verify safety and context: if sepsis risk is nontrivial or the joint is technically accessible, aspiration should not be deferred, as missing septic arthritis would be a critical error [^1152rKQM].

> If aspiration is not feasible, I should review imaging options carefully. Ultrasound can demonstrate the double contour sign and tophi; the double contour sign has pooled sensitivity around 74% and specificity around 88% in systematic review, while focused assessments of DC and tophus also show high specificities and PPV in prospective cohorts; AAFP 2025 endorses point-of-care ultrasound for DC assessment, and EULAR 2020 supports ultrasound to detect DC or tophi when crystal confirmation is not possible [^111FGfKM] [^1137nneE] [^116FjpPZ] [^11563DPg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DC was pathognomonic; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — although some radiology literature calls it pathognomonic, variability in sensitivity and reader dependence means I should treat it as highly specific but not absolutely exclusive, particularly early in disease or with suboptimal technique [^115V8d8W] [^1137nneE].

> I will now examine dual-energy CT as an alternative. DECT demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy with pooled person-level sensitivity around 0.81 and specificity around 0.91 in meta-analysis, and ACP review corroborates sensitivities between 85–100% and specificities between 83–92%; crucially, EULAR 2024 recommends US and/or DECT for evaluation and even states that if characteristic MSU deposition is seen on these modalities, synovial fluid analysis need not be performed to confirm the diagnosis, which is a strong practice-shaping update I should integrate [^112GG93E] [^111FGfKM] [^115sXLbA] [^115sXLbA]. But wait, what if the disease is very early? Sensitivity for DECT is lower with short disease duration, so a negative DECT early on does not exclude gout, and I should reassess or use complementary methods if suspicion remains high [^112GG93E].

> Let me think about imaging protocol and sequencing. I should include symptomatic joints and, when possible, the first metatarsophalangeal joint to increase yield, per EULAR 2024; baseline radiography can be reasonable in suspected inflammatory arthritis to assess erosions or alternate diagnoses, though its value in acute gout is limited and should be complemented by US or DECT when gout is suspected [^113EAbQM] [^117VnH6i] [^113ZoxJR]. I need to ensure imaging findings are interpreted alongside clinical context to avoid overcalling incidental urate deposits or missing CPPD patterns [^115sXLbA].

> If neither aspiration nor advanced imaging is available, I should apply validated classification criteria. The ACR/EULAR 2015 criteria, with a threshold score of 8 out of 23, offer high sensitivity and specificity when all domains are available; even when imaging and synovial fluid data are missing, clinical-only scoring retains reasonable performance, and I must remember the negative scoring for MSU-negative fluid and very low urate, which appropriately lowers the likelihood in those contexts [^111wF2ys] [^112L2HDh] [^115JPZiz]. Hold on, I should verify use-case: these criteria are for classification, not absolute diagnosis, but in resource-limited settings they guide decisions reasonably well when other tests are unavailable [^115zUPTE].

> For primary care settings, I should also consider the Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule when joint fluid analysis is not done. This rule incorporates sex, prior attack, rapid onset, redness, first MTP involvement, cardiovascular disease, and serum urate, with a high PPV for scores ≥ 8 and strong external validation in secondary care; I need to check exclusion criteria like polyarticular disease or suspected sepsis before applying it [^116UURAV] [^117H9S7Q]. Let me reconsider if the rule conflicts with red flags; in those cases, aspiration and broader workup take precedence to avoid missing alternative urgent diagnoses [^1152rKQM].

> I should double-check how to interpret serum urate. Serum urate is supportive but not diagnostic; levels can be normal during an acute flare, so I must avoid ruling out gout on a single normal value, and I should retest outside of flares for risk stratification and to guide therapy targets once gout is established [^111FGfKM] [^115V8d8W]. After confirmation, treat-to-target recommendations consistently advise maintaining serum urate below 6 mg/dL for all patients and ≤ 5 mg/dL for severe disease such as tophi or frequent flares, which I should align with EULAR, BSR, and T2T guidance when planning long-term management after diagnosis is secured [^1161UGP6] [^1128TALh] [^114Ny1jR] [^112yeJDc].

> Now, special populations and additional testing deserve attention. Before starting allopurinol, I should consider HLA-B✱58:01 testing in patients of Southeast Asian descent and African American patients due to the increased risk of severe hypersensitivity, per ACR 2020, and continue ULT to maintain target urate once initiated to reduce flares and burden of crystal deposition [^111FFwnx] [^116z9DFQ]. Next, I should review infection screening needs when immunosuppressive strategies are used for flares or comorbidity management, following EULAR 2023 recommendations for HBV, HCV, HIV, and latent TB screening tailored to the intensity of planned therapy and patient risk factors [^117PMKUr] [^111CYX6q] [^116UauX6] [^1122cPny].

> Differential diagnosis must be actively managed. I need to ensure septic arthritis is excluded in any acute monoarthritis, typically necessitating aspiration when feasible, and to distinguish gout from calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease by crystal analysis when possible; imaging patterns can assist, but crystals remain decisive for the CPPD versus MSU distinction in uncertain cases [^1152rKQM] [^111cXdw2] [^115sXLbA]. Hold on, I should verify whether imaging misclassification could occur; yes, early disease and overlapping sonographic signs can confound interpretation, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical features and, when possible, synovial fluid microscopy [^111FGfKM].

> Integrating into a practical diagnostic algorithm, I would proceed as follows while checking each branch for feasibility and risk: assess clinical probability and red flags; if safe and feasible, perform arthrocentesis for MSU crystals to confirm gout; if aspiration is not feasible, obtain ultrasound for double contour or tophus and consider DECT when available; if imaging is characteristic, I can accept the diagnosis without fluid analysis per EULAR 2024; if imaging is unavailable or indeterminate, apply ACR/EULAR 2015 criteria or the Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule while planning follow-up testing; throughout, maintain vigilance for septic arthritis and CPPD and reassess if the course deviates from expectation [^113MrCC1] [^115sXLbA] [^115JPZiz] [^116UURAV].

> Finally, I need to ensure common pitfalls and exceptions are addressed. Early disease reduces DECT sensitivity and ultrasound yields can vary by operator and joint selection, so a negative study does not exclude gout when suspicion remains high; repeating imaging, targeting the first MTP in addition to symptomatic sites, or reattempting aspiration later may be necessary, and I should avoid overreliance on a normal serum urate during a flare to dismiss the diagnosis [^112GG93E] [^113EAbQM] [^111FGfKM]. If my initial pathway leads to uncertainty, let me reconsider the differential and escalate to crystal analysis or advanced imaging as access and patient safety allow, ensuring the final diagnosis is both clinically coherent and evidence-based [^113MrCC1] [^117YR5Kt].

The definitive test for gout is **synovial fluid analysis** with polarized light microscopy to identify monosodium urate (MSU) crystals [^111NWXYW] [^113MrCC1], which is the gold standard for diagnosis [^111cXdw2]. If aspiration is not feasible, **ultrasound or dual-energy CT** [^114jqwUb] can noninvasively detect urate deposition (double contour sign or tophi) [^1137nneE] and confirm gout [^115sXLbA]. Serum urate supports diagnosis [^1152rKQM] but is neither sensitive nor specific [^111FGfKM], especially during flares [^115V8d8W]. Use clinical criteria (e.g. ACR/EULAR) [^111wF2ys] when crystals or imaging are unavailable [^1152rKQM].

---

## Synovial fluid analysis (gold standard)

- **Procedure**: Aspirate synovial fluid from the affected joint and examine under polarized light microscopy [^111NWXYW].
- **Findings**: Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent MSU crystals [^113MrCC1] confirm gout [^111cXdw2].
- **Limitations**: Invasive; may be infeasible in small joints or if fluid is scant [^1111X7CV].

---

## Serum urate measurement

Serum urate measurement is **supportive** [^113MrCC1] but **neither sensitive nor specific** [^111FGfKM]; levels may be normal during acute flares [^115V8d8W], and hyperuricemia alone does not confirm gout [^1152rKQM].

---

## Imaging modalities

### Ultrasound

- **Findings**: Double contour sign (urate on cartilage), tophi [^117S9b34], aggregates, erosions [^1137nneE].
- **Accuracy**: Sensitivity 77–95% [^111FGfKM]; specificity 88–95% for double contour and tophi [^1137nneE].
- **Limitations**: Operator-dependent; less sensitive in early disease [^114jqwUb].

---

### Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)

- **Findings**: Color-coded urate deposits [^114jqwUb]; high accuracy in established disease [^112GG93E].
- **Accuracy**: Sensitivity 81–89%; specificity 88–91% [^112GG93E] [^1136PnEt].
- **Limitations**: Lower sensitivity in early disease; radiation exposure; limited availability [^112GG93E].

---

### Plain radiography

Plain radiography primarily **detects chronic changes** (erosions, tophi) [^115bdqHM] and has limited value in acute flares [^113ZoxJR]. Limitations include poor sensitivity in early disease and nonspecific findings.

---

## Clinical criteria

The **ACR/EULAR clinical criteria** [^111wF2ys] integrate clinical, laboratory, and imaging data when crystal analysis is unavailable [^1152rKQM]. However, they are less specific than crystal identification and carry a risk of misclassification.

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Test** | **Role** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Synovial fluid analysis | Gold standard | - Invasive <br/> - May be infeasible |
| 2 | Ultrasound or DECT | Noninvasive confirmation | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited availability |
| 3 | Serum urate | Supportive | - Nonspecific <br/> - Variable during flares |
| 4 | Clinical criteria | Alternative when above unavailable | Lower specificity |

---

Synovial fluid analysis remains the **diagnostic gold standard** [^113MrCC1]; use ultrasound or DECT [^114jqwUb] when aspiration is not feasible, and apply clinical criteria [^111wF2ys] when neither crystal identification nor imaging is available.

### Synovial fluid analysis for crystals [^111cXdw2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of review**: Describe why this review is timely and relevant. Identifying monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystals allows a quick and definitive diagnosis of both gout and CPPD arthritis and remains the accepted gold standard. These diseases are still often diagnosed on inaccurate clinical grounds. Crystal identification has received little critical attention since its introduction, and it appears necessary to review the technique, paying special attention to the possible reasons which deter clinicians.

- **Recent findings**: Describe the main themes in the literature covered by the article. Synovial fluid analysis for crystals is a simple procedure allowing immediate and definite diagnosis of gout and CPPD arthritis when clinics are fitted with a proper microscope and the rheumatologists appropriately trained. This review also illustrates how crystal analysis in synovial fluid can be initially approached with both the widely available ordinary light microscope and a simple polarized one, yielding good results.

- **Summary**: This study describes the implications of the findings for clinical practice or research. We hope that those not performing synovial fluid analysis will be stimulated to acquire or perfect the technique and obtain a compensated polarized microscope to comply with standards.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers, with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the existing guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow, and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management, as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies, appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers struggle with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Gout and the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and death in the UK Biobank: a population-based study [^111oXpN2]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data on outcomes for people with gout and COVID-19. We aimed to assess whether gout is a risk factor for diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death, and to test for sex- and drug-specific differences in risk.

- **Methods**: We used data from the UK Biobank, which included 15,871 people with gout. We employed multivariable-adjusted logistic regression in the following analyses using a case-control study design: to test for an association between gout and COVID-19 diagnosis in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n = 459,837); to test for an association between gout and COVID-19-related death in people who were known to have died or survived with COVID-19 (n = 15,772); to test for an association between gout and COVID-19-related death in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n = 459,837); and to assess risk of COVID-19-related death in a subset of patients from the UK Biobank cohort with prescription data, stratified by prescription of urate-lowering therapy and colchicine (n = 341,398). Models 1 and 2 were adjusted for age group, sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, BMI, and smoking status. Model 2 was also adjusted for diagnosis of 16 other diseases that are established comorbidities of gout or established risk factors for COVID-19-related death.

- **Findings**: Gout was associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.11–1.29) but not with risk of COVID-19-related death in the cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.96–1.51). In the entire cohort, gout was associated with COVID-19-related death (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06–1.56). Women with gout had an…

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^117YR5Kt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

In Phase 2, an international panel of expert rheumatologists and primary care physicians used a multicriterion decision analytic consensus methodology, informed by data generated in Phase 1, to determine the factors that best discriminated gout from other rheumatic diseases that could conceivably be considered in the differential diagnosis. Such an approach would lead to expert-derived, data-informed weighting of discriminating factors.

Rheumatologists and general internists with an interest in gout submitted paper patient cases of patients for whom gout was in the differential diagnosis, using standardized data collection forms. A subset of 30 paper patient cases was selected to represent a broad spectrum of the probability of gout. Prior to the in-person expert panel meeting, panel members were given the data from Phase 1 to review, and they were asked to rank-order the 30 paper patient cases from lowest to highest probability of having gout.

At the in-person expert panel meeting, held over two days (June 9–10, 2014, in Paris, France, in advance of the EULAR Congress), three concepts were agreed upon a priori:

- **Create standardized criteria**: The task was to develop criteria that would enable standardized assembly of a well-defined, relatively homogeneous group of subjects representative of persons with gout for entry into observational studies or clinical trials. These criteria are not intended to capture all possible patients, but rather to capture the great majority of patients with shared key features of gout.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^112D3qBA]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, specifically in relation to anti-inflammatory therapy, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day, reduced in cases of renal impairment) as the first-line prophylactic treatment. It is important to recognize the potential for neurotoxicity and/or muscular toxicity with prophylactic colchicine in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing statin therapy. Furthermore, avoid co-prescribing colchicine with strong P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1111X7CV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The new ACR/EULAR gout classification criteria represent an international collaborative effort that incorporates the latest published evidence on imaging modalities, a data‐driven approach with MSU identification as a gold standard to reference key features, and a decision analytic approach to inform the weighting of the scoring system. This classification criteria set will enable a standardized approach to identifying a relatively homogeneous group of individuals who have the clinical entity of gout for enrollment into studies. The criteria permit characterization of an individual as having gout, regardless of whether he or she is currently experiencing an acute symptomatic episode and regardless of any comorbidities. The new classification criteria have superior performance characteristics, with high sensitivity and improved specificity compared with previously published criteria. Specificity, which leads to a high positive predictive value, is of critical importance in most clinical studies since investigators need to have confidence that individuals who are enrolled in a study truly have the condition of interest.

Gout is unlike other rheumatic diseases in that a gold standard assessment is available, i.e. MSU crystal positivity. While this gold standard has high specificity, its feasibility and sensitivity may be inadequate due to difficulty with aspiration of joints (particularly small ones) and/or examination of the sample under polarizing microscopy. Thus, although MSU crystal results are extremely helpful when positive, they are not a feasible solution in all cases.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114aygdd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Based on the key features identified initially, Phase 1 data, and available published literature, and with a defined population to whom the criteria would apply, the expert panel further developed the pertinent domains and their respective categories in an iterative process. The expert panel aimed to define relevant clinical and imaging parameters to be as specific as possible for gout.

- **Domains and categories**: The domains included clinical parameters (numbers 1–4), laboratory parameters (numbers 5 and 6), and imaging parameters (numbers 7 and 8). The specific domains and their respective definitions are summarized in Table 1. The domains were designed to be scored based on the totality of the subjects' symptomatic disease experience. All of the categories within domains are hierarchical and mutually exclusive, such that if both a higher and a lower category have been fulfilled at different points in time, the higher one should be scored; the highest categories are listed last within each domain.

Symptomatic episodes were defined as those in which there was swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa. For the pattern of joint involvement, it was agreed that first metatarsophalangeal joint, ankle, or midfoot involvement as part of a polyarticular presentation, though possible in gout, was not specific enough for gout since that pattern could be seen commonly in other disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. The time course of symptomatic episodes was to be considered irrespective of anti-inflammatory treatment.

### A re-look at an old disease: A multimodality review on gout [^117Y4Fea]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gout, the most common form of microcrystalline arthropathy, has always interested radiologists. The diagnosis of gout is primarily based on clinical and laboratory findings; however, it has well-known and characteristic radiographic manifestations. Radiographs remain the examination of choice in the diagnosis of joint involvement. Plain radiographs are less sensitive to early changes in gout than other imaging techniques. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) have demonstrated an increasing role in the early diagnosis of gouty arthritis, for assessing the extent of soft-tissue involvement and as problem-solving tools for diagnostically difficult cases. Cross-sectional imaging can also be used for guiding needle aspirations in patients with an acute attack of gout, which may simulate an infective process clinically. This pictorial review illustrates the main imaging features of gout on radiographs, MRI, CT, and ultrasound, with the aim of helping the radiologist to make a confident diagnosis in radiographically typical cases and to serve as a problem-solving tool in cases that present a diagnostic dilemma.

### The validation of a diagnostic rule for gout without joint fluid analysis: A prospective study [^117H9S7Q]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The gold standard for diagnosing gout is the identification of MSU crystals in joint fluid. However, in secondary care, the facilities or expertise to analyze joint fluid are not always available, leading to clinical diagnosis of gout. To improve the predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of gout in secondary care, a diagnostic rule developed in primary care could be helpful. The aim of this study was to validate this diagnostic rule in a secondary care population, using the gold standard as a reference test.

Three hundred and ninety patients with monoarthritis were included. The variables of the diagnostic rule (male sex, previous arthritis attack, onset 5.88 mg/dl) were collected and scored. The affected joint was aspirated, and joint fluid was analyzed for the presence of MSU crystals.

In 219 patients (56%), MSU crystals were found. The positive predictive value of a score of ≥ 8 points was 0.87, while the negative predictive value of a score of ≤ 4 points was 0.95. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnostic rule was 0.86 (95% CI 0.82, 0.89). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test showed that the difference between the expected and observed probabilities was non-significant (P = 0.64), indicating good agreement.

An easy-to-use diagnostic rule for gout developed in primary care shows good performance in secondary care and improves the predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of gout.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^1128TALh]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

In terms of medical management for gout, the 2017 BSR guidelines specify treatment targets, recommending that the initial aim of urate-lowering therapy should be to reduce and maintain the serum urate level to ≤ 300 mcmol/L. This level is necessary to prevent further urate crystal formation and to dissolve existing crystals. It is important to note that the lower the serum urate level, the greater the velocity of crystal elimination.

### Survey definitions of gout for epidemiologic studies: Comparison with crystal identification as the gold standard [^114hVn8q]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

To identify the best-performing survey definition of gout from items commonly available in epidemiologic studies, survey definitions of gout were identified from 34 epidemiologic studies contributing to the Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC) genome-wide association study. Data from the Study for Updated Gout Classification Criteria (SUGAR) were randomly divided into development and test data sets. A data-driven case definition was formed using logistic regression in the development data set. This definition, along with definitions used in GUGC studies and the 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) gout classification criteria, was applied to the test data set using monosodium urate crystal identification as the gold standard.

For all tested GUGC definitions, the simple definition of "self-report of gout or urate-lowering therapy use" had the best test performance characteristics (sensitivity 82%, specificity 72%). This simple definition had similar performance to a SUGAR data-driven case definition with five weighted items: self-report, self-report of doctor diagnosis, colchicine use, urate-lowering therapy use, and hyperuricemia (sensitivity 87%, specificity 70%). Both of these definitions performed better than the 1977 American Rheumatism Association survey criteria (sensitivity 82%, specificity 67%). Of all tested definitions, the 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria had the best performance (sensitivity 92%, specificity 89%).

A simple definition of "self-report of gout or urate-lowering the…

### Imaging in gout: Insights into the pathological features of disease [^117VWTyc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Imaging has the potential to assess various pathological manifestations of gout, including monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition, tophus formation, and cartilage, soft tissue, and bone pathology. This review discusses recent research examining the role of imaging to assess the manifestations of disease.

- **Recent findings**: Various imaging techniques are used in the assessment of gout, including plain radiography, ultrasonography, conventional computed tomography (CT), dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), and MRI. Potential roles for ultrasonography are MSU crystal detection, measurement of tophi, and assessment of disease complications. Ultrasonography may allow detection of MSU crystals in patients with hyperuricaemia prior to the development of clinically apparent gout. Conventional CT allows excellent visualization of tophi and bone erosion. DECT is a promising method of noninvasive MSU crystal detection. MRI allows assessment of tophi, synovial and soft tissue disease, and bone pathology. The relative absence of MRI bone marrow oedema in gout suggests that the mechanisms of bone erosion in gout are quite different from those in other erosive arthropathies.

Imaging modalities have provided important insights into the pathology of gout. The role of various imaging techniques in gout diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcomes is rapidly developing.

### Ultrasound for the diagnosis of gout-the value of gout lesions as defined by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology ultrasound group [^1137nneE]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate ultrasound for diagnosing gout using consensus-based Outcome Measures in Rheumatology ultrasound definitions of gout lesions, ultrasound was performed on patients with clinically suspected gout. A total of 28 joints and 26 tendons were evaluated for the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology gout lesions, including double contour (DC), tophus, aggregates, and erosions. The ultrasound assessment was then compared with two reference standards: the presence of MSU crystals in joint/tophus aspirate as the primary outcome, and the ACR/EULAR 2015 gout classification criteria as the secondary outcome. Both reference standards were assessed by rheumatologists who were blinded to the ultrasound findings. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each ultrasound lesion against both reference standards were determined.

Eighty-two patients, comprising 70 men with a mean age of 62.4 years (range 19–88), were included in the study. Of these, 57 patients were MSU-positive, while 25 patients were MSU-negative (23 had no MSU crystals and 2 had unsuccessful aspiration). Among these 25 patients, three were classified as ACR/EULAR-positive, resulting in a total of 60 ACR/EULAR-positive patients. All ultrasound lesions demonstrated high sensitivities for gout (0.77–0.95). Specifically, DC and tophus showed high specificities (0.88–0.95), positive predictive values (0.94–0.98), and accuracies (0.82–0.84) when assessed against both reference standards. In contrast, aggregates and erosions presented low specificities (0.32–0.59). Ultrasound of MTP joints for DC or tophus, knee joint for DC, and peroneus tendons for tophus showed promising results.

### Diagnosis of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111FGfKM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alternative strategies exist for diagnosing gout that do not rely solely on the documentation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals.

- **Purpose**: To summarize evidence regarding the accuracy of clinical tests and classification algorithms compared with that of a reference standard of MSU crystals in joint aspirate for diagnosing gout.

- **Data sources**: Several electronic databases from inception to 29 February 2016.

- **Study selection**: Twenty-one prospective cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies including participants with joint inflammation and no previous definitive gout diagnosis who had MSU analysis of joint aspirate.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment by two reviewers independently; overall strength of evidence (SOE) judgment by group.

- **Data synthesis**: Recently developed algorithms, including clinical, laboratory, and imaging criteria, demonstrated good sensitivity (up to 88%) and fair to good specificity (up to 96%) for diagnosing gout (moderate SOE). Three studies of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) showed sensitivities of 85% to 100% and specificities of 83% to 92% for diagnosing gout (low SOE). Six studies of ultrasonography showed sensitivities of 37% to 100% and specificities of 68% to 97%, depending on the ultrasonography signs assessed (pooled sensitivity and specificity for the double contour sign: 74% [95% CI, 52% to 88%] and 88% [CI, 68% to 96%], respectively [low SOE]).

- **Limitation**: Important study heterogeneity and selection bias; scant evidence in primary and urgent care settings and in patients with conditions that may be confounding.

### New classification criteria for gout: A framework for progress [^114vWb5j]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The definitive classification or diagnosis of gout normally relies upon the identification of MSU crystals in SF or from tophi. Where microscopic examination of SF is not available or is impractical, the best approach may differ depending upon the context. For many types of research, clinical classification criteria are necessary. The increasing prevalence of gout, advances in therapeutics, and the development of international research collaborations to understand the impact, mechanisms, and optimal treatment of this condition emphasize the need for accurate and uniform classification criteria for gout.

Five clinical classification criteria for gout currently exist. However, none of the currently available criteria have been adequately validated. An international project is currently underway to develop new validated gout classification criteria. These criteria will be an essential step forward to advance the research agenda in the modern era of gout management.

### Imaging in rheumatology: Reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115V8d8W]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Gout imaging had a limited role to play until recently because soft tissue opacification and bone lesions do not appear until the later stages of the disease, by which time the diagnosis is usually obvious clinically. However, the clinical presentation and history of gout are not always typical; the serum urate can drop within the normal range during an acute attack, and the "gold standard" for diagnosis, i.e. identification of urate crystals in joint fluid, is frequently not practicable.

Gouty lesions can, however, be identified readily by ultrasound and MRI, which offer scope for improvement in the management of the condition. Ultrasound can be used to demonstrate tophi and synovial changes and demonstrates most of the lesions seen on MRI. A double-contour sign (a hyperechoic irregular band over the articular cartilage best seen on the dorsal side of metatarsophalangeal joints) is considered pathognomonic, representing a layer of urate crystals over the cartilage. However, tophi are sonographically unspecific in appearance. Compared with MRI, ultrasound is less sensitive concerning cortical erosions but better than radiographs. Although changes can be detected over time, it remains unclear whether serial assessment of tophi, synovial change, or erosions will prove most useful in the management of gout.

A 73-year-old man with anterior knee pain and soft tissue swelling was suspicious for bursitis. Ultrasound demonstrated a highly echogenic prepatellar mass, not typical for bursitis (sagittal extended field of view image).

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^111wF2ys]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Results of testing of the new gout classification criteria and comparison with existing published criteria

In the SUGAR validation data set (n = 330), the sensitivity of the new classification criteria was 0.92, and specificity was 0.89. The performance of the criteria was also tested using only clinical parameters, i.e. without MSU results, scored as 0 (unknown/not done) and without imaging (i.e. radiographic, ultrasound, or DECT imaging) results, scored as 0; this latter scoring was in keeping with similar weighting being given to imaging studies that were negative versus not being performed in the discrete-choice experiments. In this setting, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 and 0.78.

- **Performance of the gout classification criteria**: When compared with existing published criteria (using their respective published thresholds), the new classification criteria performed well. For some existing criteria sets, the presence of MSU crystals alone is sufficient to fulfill criteria; they are therefore 100% sensitive by definition. The new gout classification criteria also have MSU positivity as a sufficient criterion for classification, but the criteria set was not assessed in that regard, to avoid circularity. When the new classification criteria set was compared in its complete form (i.e. incorporating imaging and MSU data) with other published "full" criteria, some existing criteria had higher sensitivity, but all had lower specificity.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115zUPTE]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The existing criteria for the classification of gout have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity and were developed at a time when advanced imaging was not available. The effort was undertaken to develop new classification criteria for gout.

An international group of investigators, supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, conducted a systematic review of the literature on advanced imaging of gout. A diagnostic study, where the presence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus was the gold standard, was carried out along with a ranking exercise of paper patient cases and a multicriterion decision analysis exercise. These data formed the basis for developing the classification criteria, which were tested in an independent data set.

The entry criterion for the new classification criteria requires the occurrence of at least one episode of peripheral joint or bursal swelling, pain, or tenderness. The presence of MSU crystals in a symptomatic joint/bursa (i.e. synovial fluid) or in a tophus is a sufficient criterion for the classification of the subject as having gout, and does not require further scoring. The domains of the new classification criteria include:

- **Clinical**: Pattern of joint/bursa involvement, characteristics, and time course of symptomatic episodes.
- **Laboratory**: Serum urate, MSU-negative synovial fluid aspirate.
- **Imaging**: Double-contour sign on ultrasound, urate on dual-energy computed tomography, radiographic gout-related erosion.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases from their inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis, and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision-making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### The genetics of gout: Towards personalised medicine [^112QdUNp]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Translation of genetic discoveries into clinical practice: towards personalised medicine for gout management?

In clinical practice, there are a few situations where genetic testing can assist with diagnosis and decisions about management. Monogenic syndromes such as partial hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase overactivity, or autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease caused by UMOD pathogenic variants are rare. Routine testing for these mutations is not required for the vast majority of individuals with gout. People with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at risk of severe haemolysis and methemoglobinaemia when treated with pegloticase, and screening for this condition (typically by enzyme activity, rather than genotyping) is recommended before commencing pegloticase. In addition, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variant HLA-B✱5801 is an important risk factor for severe allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS). Therefore, testing for this variant has been recommended in high-risk populations (Han Chinese, other Asian populations) prior to commencing allopurinol.

These examples are isolated and specific, and clinical practice does not routinely integrate genetic testing into gout management. A key question is how the new discoveries from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of hyperuricaemia and gout can impact on the clinical management of gout. Aside from the identification of potential new therapeutic targets, genomic approaches may allow personalised assessment.

### Use of ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of outcomes in crystal arthropathies [^116DJPWw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the latest recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, where the diagnostic potential of ultrasound has been acknowledged. The review emphasizes recent research advances in the use of ultrasound in diagnosing and monitoring outcomes in gout and CPPD crystal deposition disease.

Recent findings indicate that ultrasound is a highly sensitive, noninvasive, and quick method for detecting microcrystal aggregates in various anatomical areas. It serves as a safe and reliable guide for aspirating even minimal fluid collections suitable for microscopic analysis and acts as a tool for monitoring the dissolution of monosodium urate crystals induced by urate-lowering therapy. Notably, the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the knee are the anatomical regions with the highest likelihood of being positive for monosodium urate and CPPD crystal aggregates, respectively.

The summary outlines that detecting highly evocative signs in patients with uncertain clinical findings can significantly impact the clinical decision-making process. This narrows the differential diagnostic spectrum and avoids time-consuming and expensive diagnostic procedures. The ultrasound differential diagnosis between gout and CPPD crystal deposition disease is based on the characteristics of crystal aggregates and their preferential localization in different anatomical areas.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle - initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^1117jaHD]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs due to an inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; hence, the prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following the initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured). Participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias, and ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence to preserve the randomization principle, satisfy methodological scrutiny, and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^111JghgA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate-lowering therapies, a number of unanswered clinical questions remain. With the resurgence of interest in gout, it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review encompass basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face daily. These include when urate-lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate-lowering therapy, and determining the most appropriate urate-lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research. Some, such as the use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may become less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate-lowering therapies. However, until that time, further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### Definition of hyperuricemia and gouty conditions [^111a5A28]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of the review is to define gout conditions and hyperuricemia.

- **Recent findings**: Gout is defined as an arthritic condition resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in and/or around joints, following long-standing hyperuricemia. Several recent ultrasound studies disclosed MSU deposits in a large proportion of asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients. A gout condition defined by asymptomatic MSU deposits can therefore be individualized. Such asymptomatic deposits appear to precede the occurrence of flares, which seem to be triggered by mobilization of preformed crystals. Hyperuricemia appears to be the main, if not the only, risk factor for gout. Recent studies also support the view that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for renal and cardiovascular diseases. The level at which uricemia becomes abnormal is still disputed. This lack of consensus precludes comparison of studies using different definitions and impairs the understanding of gout by doctors and patients. We propose to define hyperuricemia as greater than 6 mg/dl, as the life-long risk of gout seems to start at this level. This definition is identical to the minimum uricemia target of urate-lowering drugs (ULDs).

In summary, asymptomatic MSU crystal deposits can now be identified and precede the onset of gout flares. Defining hyperuricemia as greater than 6 mg/dl would have the advantage of providing the same value for normal and ULD-targeted uricemia, which would facilitate patients' adherence to this target.

### Screening for hyperuricaemia and gout: A perspective and research agenda [^117Mdsi3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of a screening program is to reduce an adverse health outcome in a defined population. Screening can be undertaken at several stages throughout the disease course: before the onset of disease, early in the course of the disease, or in established disease (for complications). In the setting of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and gout, the aim of screening would be to identify those individuals with hyperuricaemia and therefore at risk of gout, with the aim of introducing interventions to prevent the onset of gout. Herein we consider the concepts of screening for hyperuricaemia and gout, potential screening methods, and target populations that might benefit from such an approach.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practices, barriers to effective care, and strategies to overcome these barriers.

To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to understand not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy to achieve a specific target level of serum uric acid below the saturation point for crystal formation. Perspectives are shifting toward much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of the first diagnosis of gout.

Holistic assessment and patient education are essential for addressing patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### A diagnostic rule for acute gouty arthritis in primary care without joint fluid analysis [^116UURAV]. Archives of Internal Medicine (2010). High credibility.

The Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule is a clinical calculator used to diagnose acute gout without joint fluid analysis. This tool is intended for adult patients presenting with monoarthritis, where only one joint is inflamed. Its primary utility is to assist clinicians in diagnosing acute gout in scenarios where joint fluid analysis is unavailable or impractical. The calculator combines clinical factors and laboratory results to estimate the likelihood of a gout flare.

Exclusion criteria for this calculator include patients with polyarticular disease (affecting more than one joint), septic arthritis, recent joint trauma, or other evident causes of monoarthritis. It is also unsuitable for patients previously diagnosed with gout or pseudogout.

The rule evaluates the probability of an acute gout diagnosis by considering specific symptoms and medical history. It uses yes or no responses to particular factors, which are converted into a numerical score. This score corresponds to a prevalence percentage that indicates the likelihood of gout.

The inputs include:

- **Male sex**
- **Previous patient-reported arthritis attack**
- **Onset within 1 day**
- **Joint redness**
- **First metatarsophalangeal joint involvement**: This is a common site for gout.
- **History of cardiovascular or related conditions**: Such conditions include hypertension or angina.
- **Serum uric acid level greater than 5.88 mg/dL (or 0.35 mmol/L)**:

For each condition checked as true, specific points are assigned.

- **Monoarticular involvement**: Especially in a foot (notably the first metatarsophalangeal) or ankle joint.
- **Previous similar acute arthritis episodes**: Recurrent episodes strengthen the diagnostic suspicion.
- **Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling**: The condition worsens in less than 24 hours.
- **Erythema**: A noticeable symptom that accompanies joint inflammation.
- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated levels of uric acid can support diagnosis.
- **Associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**: The presence of these conditions can heighten the likelihood of gout diagnosis.

### Treatment of chronic gout. Can we determine when urate stores are depleted enough to prevent attacks of gout [^113MVkTw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The study objective was to determine if lowering serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl, or maintaining this lowered level for a longer duration, would result in the depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints and prevent further attacks of gout.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at Philadelphia VA Medical Center. The aim was to maintain SUA levels in patients with crystal-proven gout at 6 mg/dl. Group B had SUA levels for 12 months. Nearly half of the participants experienced no gout attacks for 2 or more years, with a mean of one attack in the last year for the whole group. Three patients with tophi did not have major flares of gout within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was performed on 16 asymptomatic patients, and seven (44%) still had MSU crystals present in their knees.

The existing criteria for the classification of gout have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity. These criteria were developed when advanced imaging techniques were not available. This effort aimed to develop new classification criteria for gout.

An international group of investigators, supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, conducted a systematic review of the literature on advanced imaging of gout. They also performed a diagnostic study where the presence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus was the gold standard, a ranking exercise of paper patient cases, and a multicriterion decision analysis exercise. The data collected from these activities formed the basis for developing the classification criteria, which were tested in an independent data set.

The entry criterion for the new classification requires at least one episode of peripheral joint or bursal swelling, pain, or tenderness. The presence of MSU crystals in a symptomatic joint/bursa (i.e. synovial fluid) or in a tophus is a sufficient criterion for classifying a subject as having gout, without needing further scoring. The domains of the new classification criteria include:

- **Clinical**: Pattern of joint/bursa involvement, characteristics, and time course of symptomatic episodes.

The expert panel performed a threshold identification exercise designed to assess the members' willingness to enroll 47 paper cases, based on sufficient confidence that the individual has gout, into a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial of a new urate‐lowering agent with unclear efficacy and safety. The score at which the majority considered an individual as having gout fell at the same threshold as that identified as the cutoff that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity.

Final criteria scoring: With face validity of the initial scoring system confirmed and a threshold identified, the raw relative weights of domain categories and the threshold score were rescaled and rounded into whole numbers to simplify the scoring system while retaining the relative weighting produced by the expert panel. The maximum possible score in the final criteria is 23. A threshold score of ≥ 8 classifies an individual as having gout.

A unique aspect of the new classification criteria is that two categories elicit negative scores. Specifically, if the synovial fluid is MSU negative, 2 points are subtracted from the total score. Similarly, if the serum urate level is < 4 mg/dl (< 0.24 mmoles/liter), 4 points are subtracted from the total score. This approach was taken to emphasize these findings.

### Outcome measures for acute and chronic gout [^113hVmsY]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Gout provides some unique challenges in the classification and measurement of outcomes. Our aim was to evaluate criteria for classification and to develop and validate optimal instruments to measure outcomes for acute and chronic gout. A planning committee and interested attendees met to propose classification criteria and domains for outcomes. Seven of the American Rheumatism Association preliminary criteria for classification were proposed as the best criteria for acute gouty arthritis, pending further studies. The presence of gout is best established by crystal identification, although this technique has limitations. Five domains for acute gout outcomes and nine for chronic gout were identified, along with proposed instruments for testing and validation. The unique problems of gout evaluation can and will be addressed.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1119KM5h]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Gout, characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) in synovial fluid and other tissues, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence of 3.9% in the US, 0.9% in France, 1.4–2.5% in the UK, 1.4% in Germany, and 3.2% (European ancestry) to 6.1% (Maori ancestry) in New Zealand. Over the last decade, several new therapies for gout have been approved by regulatory agencies or are being tested. The conduct of trials that lead to drug approval and observational studies that provide insights into risk factors, genetic associations, and general epidemiology of gout is critically dependent on the appropriate identification of individuals with gout for inclusion in such studies. Classification criteria enable standardized assembly of a relatively homogeneous group of individuals with the disease of interest for enrollment into such studies.

There are several existing sets of classification criteria or diagnostic rules for gout. The most widely used are the 1977 American Rheumatism Association (now the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) preliminary criteria for the classification of the acute arthritis of primary gout. These preliminary criteria were intended for identifying the acute arthritis of gout and not necessarily for intercritical gout. The spectrum of comparator diseases was limited, and physician diagnosis was the gold standard. In a recent study where the gold standard was MSU crystal status in synovial fluid or nodule aspiration, the classification criteria were applied.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^111uCu5B]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In general, diagnosis of gout is achieved by clinical findings and laboratory analysis. There are no specific radiographic findings present in an acute gout flare, whereas chronically affected joints may show periarticular erosions with sclerotic margins. MRI will also show bony erosions (if present), bone marrow and/or soft-tissue edema, synovial pannus, and gouty tophi in chronic cases. Figure 1, A and B shows corresponding radiographic and MRI of periarticular erosions and gouty tophi in the thumb. Tophi may appear hypointense or isointense on T1, variable signal on T2, and enhance homogeneously with contrast. Ultrasonography of gouty arthropathy will show effusions, synovitis, and even MSU crystals themselves.

The ultrasonographic double-contour sign refers to irregular hyperechoic enhancement of the articular surface representing MSU crystal deposition that has been described in patients with chronic gout and subcutaneous nodules on physical examination. More recently, dual-energy CT (DECT), an imaging method that differentiates materials based on their relative absorption of X-rays at different photon energy levels, has been used to identify patterns of MSU crystal deposition via color coding and can be useful in atypical presentations of gout or monitoring chronic gout over time.

### Performance of ultrasound in the diagnosis of gout in a multicenter study: Comparison with monosodium urate monohydrate crystal analysis as the gold standard [^117S9b34]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the performance of ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of gout, using the presence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals as the gold standard.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the Study for Updated Gout Classification Criteria (SUGAR), a large, multicenter observational cross-sectional study of consecutive subjects with at least one swollen joint who could potentially have gout. All subjects underwent arthrocentesis; cases were subjects with confirmed MSU crystals. Rheumatologists or radiologists, who were blinded to the results of the MSU crystal analysis, performed US on one or more clinically affected joints. US findings of interest included the double contour sign, tophus, and snowstorm appearance. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with positive US results among subjects with gout.

- **Results**: US was performed on 824 subjects (416 cases and 408 controls). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the presence of any one of the features were 76.9%, 84.3%, 83.3%, and 78.2%, respectively. Sensitivity was higher among subjects with a disease duration of ≥ 2 years and among subjects with subcutaneous nodules on examination (suspected tophus). Associations with a positive US finding included suspected clinical tophus (odds ratio [OR] 4.77 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.23–10.21]), any abnormality on plain radiography (OR 4.68 [95% CI 2.68–8.17]), and serum urate level (OR 1.31 [95% CI 1.06–1].

- **Methods**: The major steps taken to develop the new American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria for classification of gout are outlined in Figure 1. SUGAR = Study for Updated Gout Classification Criteria.

- **Phase 1**: To identify factors to be considered for the content of classification criteria for gout, three studies were undertaken. First, clinicians with expertise in gout and patients with gout identified factors they believed could discriminate gout from other rheumatic diseases in a Delphi exercise. Second, we tested items from this Delphi exercise that were agreed to be potentially discriminatory for gout, and items from existing classification criteria, in a cross-sectional diagnostic study called the Study for Updated Gout Classification Criteria (SUGAR).

	- Briefly, this study included 983 consecutive subjects, exceeding the recruitment target of 860, who had experienced joint swelling or a subcutaneous nodule within the previous two weeks, either of which was judged to be conceivably due to gout. These subjects were recruited from rheumatology clinics in 16 countries. All participants were required to undergo aspiration of the symptomatic joint or nodule, with crystal examination performed by a certified observer, as well as imaging via ultrasound and radiography. Those who were monosodium urate (MSU) crystal positive were designated as cases, while those who were MSU crystal negative were designated as controls, irrespective of clinical diagnosis.

Accurate classification of gout without crystal documentation for recruitment into studies is also needed, since the majority of cases of gout are managed in primary or acute care settings where synovial fluid aspiration and polarizing microscopy are not commonly performed. Additionally, the existing published criteria were developed at a time when advanced imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography or dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), had not been studied; their utility for gout classification in the context of other clinical and laboratory parameters is not known.

To address these issues, an international collaborative working group to develop new classification criteria for gout was convened with the support of the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). The final results are reported here.

### Investigating gout flares: Beyond a definition [^117QkxRi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Gout flares are a paramount component of the disease burden inflicted by gout onto the patient and are included in the core domain set for long-term gout studies recognized by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology. Along with a validated classification criterion for gout, investigators have focused their efforts on defining and characterizing the gout flare. This brief review summarizes the efforts made to define and characterize a gout flare in clinical studies.

Recent findings include a validated definition of a gout flare utilized in novel clinical studies, the use of technology to monitor for gout flares and their effects on patient life, and qualitative analyses into the disease burden experienced by patients.

Although guidelines for core outcome domains have been well established, there is uncertainty in methods of measuring and reporting gout flares in long-term trials. Moreover, there is doubt about the effectiveness of the agreed-upon instruments to fully capture the disease burden experienced by patients with gout. A combination of outcome measurements, including binary data (gout flare present or absent) and a comprehensive measurement of disease burden over time, would theoretically provide a more accurate description of the disease and serve as a basis for intervention development.

### Imaging modalities and monitoring measures of gout [^117BkYF6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Imaging modalities for gout have primarily been limited to radiographs. However, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are emerging techniques that could be utilized for the diagnosis, evaluation, and monitoring of both acute and chronic gout.

Recent research indicates that the diagnosis of gout is traditionally based on urate crystal observation through microscopy. Recently, the deposition of crystals in hyaline cartilage has been noted to differ in gout compared to calcium pyrophosphate deposition, although validation of these findings is still required. Simple radiographs may not reveal periarticular or intra-articular urate deposits. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging could enhance the assessment of tophi that are not detectable through clinical examination or simple radiographs. These imaging techniques could also aid in monitoring urate deposition, benefiting clinical trials and evaluating responses to urate-lowering therapy. While preliminary results on validity and reliability have been recently reported for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasonography, further sensitivity to change studies are needed. Additionally, the use of imaging techniques like power-Doppler to monitor chronic inflammation requires further research.

In summary, evidence supports the utility of imaging techniques for diagnosing, evaluating the severity, and monitoring gout, but further investigation is necessary.

### The genetics of gout: Towards personalised medicine [^113YiaV2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An important clinical question for individuals with hyperuricaemia is whether gout will develop, and for those presenting with gout, whether there is a risk of future flares and other severe consequences of the disease, such as tophi and/or joint damage. A number of variables contribute to the risk of progressive disease, with serum urate levels being the most important variable identified at the time of writing. However, serum urate levels alone do not reliably predict the progression of the disease. Risk stratification incorporating genetic testing may allow for more targeted decisions in an individual, for example, whether urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be initiated soon after (or even before) the first presentation of gout.

A consistent finding of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the observation that, while SLC2A9 variants are most strongly associated with hyperuricaemia, ABCG2 variants are more strongly associated with gout. In combination with evidence that ABCG2 is associated with gout using people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia as controls, even after adjusting for baseline serum urate levels, it can be suggested that, in addition to its effects on serum urate, ABCG2 variants may influence other checkpoints in the pathogenesis of gout, such as crystal formation and/or the inflammatory response to deposited crystals. The possibility that genetic testing has the potential to inform assessment of gout risk in people with hyperuricaemia is further supported by observations from the recent Chinese GWAS reporting three additional SNPs (BCAS3, RFX3, PKCNQ1) associated with gout when compared with asympt.

However, do not initiate IL-1 inhibitors in patients with an infection. It is also advised to adjust urate-lowering therapy to achieve the uricemia target following an IL-1 inhibitor treatment for a flare.

### Gout: Diagnosis, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations [^112MdRCo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Gout is a common form of arthritis, characterized by several well-recognized risk factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and clinical features. Despite this, new information has emerged regarding the normal physiologic role of uric acid as an antioxidant, providing greater insight into the inflammatory process in acute gout. Recent studies have enhanced our understanding of genetic and environmental factors contributing to hyperuricemia, as well as the significance of its association with other diseases. Clinically, there continues to be discussion about rare complications and disease manifestations in new populations, alongside the ongoing refinement of diagnostic methods.

### Use of imaging to evaluate gout and other crystal deposition disorders [^115mHqM4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

This review summarizes recent advances in plain radiography and advanced imaging for gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal arthropathy, and basic calcium phosphate crystal arthropathy.

- **Recent findings**: Plain radiography has demonstrated diagnostic utility in crystal-induced arthropathies, and a gout radiographic damage index has recently been validated. High-resolution ultrasonography may enhance the noninvasive diagnosis of these conditions and allow monitoring of intra-articular tophi in clinical trials. Computed tomography provides excellent definition of tophi and bone erosion. Three-dimensional computed tomography assessment of tophus volume is emerging as a promising outcome measure in gout. Magnetic resonance imaging is a reliable method for assessing tophus size and plays a significant role in detecting complications in clinical practice. Emerging imaging techniques include three-dimensional ultrasonography and dual-energy computed tomography. These advanced imaging modalities also offer new insights into the mechanisms of cartilage and bone damage in crystal-induced arthropathies.

- **Summary**: Plain radiography and advanced imaging techniques may assist with diagnosis, assessment of disease complications, and monitoring of crystal-induced arthropathies. Further study of these techniques will likely provide significant improvements in patient care and enhance understanding of disease pathogenesis.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114m1nrX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The expert panel (n = 20) comprised 19 physicians with a clinical and/or research interest in gout (17 clinical rheumatologists and 2 primary care physicians) and an epidemiologist/biostatistician. Among the panel, 9 members were from the US, 8 from Europe, 2 from New Zealand, and 1 from Mexico. One hundred thirty-three paper cases were submitted by the expert panel and 79 clinical rheumatologists and general internists.

Based on review of the Phase 1 data and the ranking exercise with the 30 cases representing low to high probability of gout, initial key factors identified as important for classifying gout were presence of MSU crystals, pattern of joint involvement, intensity of symptomatic episodes, time to maximal pain and to resolution, episodic nature of symptoms, presence of clinical tophus, level of serum urate, imaging features, response to treatment, family history, and risk factors or associated comorbidities. The last three factors were not considered further as they are not features of gout itself, despite their association with gout, and inclusion of risk factors or comorbidities in the definition of gout would preclude future studies evaluating their association with gout.

Before defining domains and domain categories (the classification criteria), entry, sufficient, and exclusion criteria were defined. The entry criteria were intended to identify the relevant patient population to whom the classification criteria would be applied. Sufficient criteria were intended to define f

### The diagnostic performance of dual energy CT for diagnosing gout: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112GG93E]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess the utility of dual energy CT (DECT) for diagnosing gout. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Studies evaluating the utility of DECT for diagnosing gout were included. Reference standards were detection of monosodium urate crystals at synovial fluid (SF) assessment or a validated set of criteria. The methodological quality of studies was evaluated according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 criteria. Data from person-based and joint-/localization-based evaluations were pooled separately, and subgroup analyses for disease stage/duration and reference standard were performed.

Results showed that in person-based evaluations, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.86) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95), respectively. In joint-based evaluations, these values were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.86) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.92), respectively. At short disease duration (≤ 6 weeks), the pooled sensitivity and specificity at the joint level were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.64) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.94), respectively.

DECT has a high diagnostic accuracy in established gout, but its diagnostic sensitivity is low in subjects with recent onset gout.

### Diagnostic performance of dual-energy CT versus ultrasonography in gout: A meta-analysis [^1136PnEt]. Academic Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), along with ultrasound (US), has been increasingly utilized for the diagnosis of gout because of its noninvasive advantages. However, the superiority of DECT over US remains controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether DECT is superior to US in the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases was conducted for potentially eligible articles. Studies that evaluated the utility of DECT or US for gout diagnosis were included. Two distinctive ultrasonographic features of gout, namely the double contour sign and the presence of tophus, were also assessed. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 criteria. Besides, subgroup analyses of early disease duration (≤ 2 years) were also performed.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DECT were 0.89 (0.80–0.94) and 0.91 (0.88–0.94), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of US were 0.70 (0.58–0.79) and 0.95 (0.87–0.98), respectively, for the double contour sign; 0.57 (0.38–0.74) and 0.99 (0.88–1.00), respectively, for tophus; and 0.84 (0.73–0.91) and 0.84 (0.78–0.89), respectively, for the overall consideration of US signs. At the early disease duration (≤ 2 years), the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (0.60–0.86) and 0.85 (0.75–0.91), respectively, for DECT; 0.93 (0.72–0.99) and 0.80 (0.71–0.86), respectively, for overall.
