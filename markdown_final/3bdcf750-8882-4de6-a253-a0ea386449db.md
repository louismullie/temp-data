## Question

What is the best time of day to take vidamin d3

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best time of day to take vitamin D3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any major guidelines specify a particular time of day. Then, I should verify whether absorption is influenced by timing or meal composition. Next, I will consider practical adherence and safety factors that might favor a certain time. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions or special cases.

> Let me first confirm whether authoritative guidelines mandate a specific time of day for vitamin D3 dosing. Wait, let me verify the Endocrine Society and American Geriatrics Society statements, because I need to ensure I'm not missing a timing directive. I should double-check, but neither the Endocrine Society nor the American Geriatrics Society specifies a particular time of day for vitamin D3 administration; instead, they emphasize choosing a schedule that maximizes adherence and using daily lower-dose regimens when indicated, which implies flexibility in timing rather than a fixed hour of the day [^113Zv5RF] [^11573bxe].

> Next, I should review absorption considerations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about needing to take it in the morning. I need to check whether meal timing or fat content materially affects absorption and whether that translates into higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Evidence suggests that taking vitamin D with a meal — particularly the largest meal of the day — improves absorption and can increase achieved 25(OH)D levels by roughly 50% compared with fasting or low-fat conditions, which argues for taking it with food rather than insisting on a specific clock time [^1159DyFD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a high-fat meal might be best, but I should verify; one study found better absorption with a low-fat meal versus high-fat or no meal, yet the 30- and 90-day 25(OH)D responses did not differ significantly across meal conditions, so the practical takeaway remains to take it with a meal rather than fasting, without over-specifying fat content [^111C7tpQ].

> I will now examine adherence and safety practicalities. Let me consider whether a consistent daily routine improves persistence. Taking vitamin D at the same time each day helps build habit and reduce missed doses, and pairing it with a meal can serve as a built-in reminder; additionally, taking it with food may mitigate any gastrointestinal sensitivity, which supports choosing a mealtime anchor rather than a strict morning-only rule. Hold on, I should verify that no safety signal emerges from evening dosing; I don't see evidence that evening administration increases adverse effects, so timing should be individualized to what the patient will actually stick with long term.

> But wait, what if the patient is on a combination product like alendronate with vitamin D3? I need to ensure I don't conflate the bisphosphonate timing rules with vitamin D timing. For Fosamax Plus D, the alendronate must be taken first thing in the morning with plain water and nothing else for at least 30 minutes, so in that specific case the vitamin D3 is effectively taken in the morning by default; this is a bisphosphonate-driven instruction, not a vitamin D pharmacokinetic requirement, so it should not be generalized to standalone vitamin D3 supplements [^114YicGN] [^114o5z5z].

> Let me synthesize this into a clear recommendation, and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. The best time of day to take vitamin D3 is the time you will remember and adhere to consistently, ideally taken with a meal to optimize absorption; if you have no preference, taking it with your largest meal of the day is reasonable, but the key is regularity and taking it with food rather than fasting, rather than a specific hour of the day [^1159DyFD] [^11573bxe].

> Finally, I should confirm special populations and exceptions. Hold on, I should verify that older adults, people with obesity or malabsorption, and those on interacting medications still follow the same timing principle. Yes, the timing advice remains the same, though higher doses or alternative forms like 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 may be needed in malabsorption or obesity; the emphasis remains on daily dosing and adherence rather than a mandated time of day, with dose adjustments guided by clinical context and, when appropriate, 25(OH)D monitoring [^115rP1Fz] [^112X7WPZ] [^113Zv5RF].

---

The best time to take vitamin D3 is **with a meal that contains fat** [^1159DyFD] (such as breakfast or lunch) to maximize absorption, as vitamin D is fat-soluble. If a fat-containing meal is not possible, take it with **milk or yogurt** to aid absorption. Morning dosing is fine, but consistency matters more than the exact hour; avoid taking it late at night if it causes sleep disturbances. Daily dosing is preferred over intermittent high-dose regimens for most adults.

---

## Absorption and bioavailability

Vitamin D3 is fat-soluble; therefore, dietary fat **enhances absorption** [^1159DyFD]. Taking it with a fat-containing meal increases serum 25(OH)D by about 50% compared with fasting or low-fat intake [^1159DyFD]. If a fatty meal is not available, milk or yogurt can help improve uptake.

---

## Circadian rhythm and vitamin D metabolism

Vitamin D metabolism follows a circadian rhythm, with 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney showing diurnal variation [^notfound]. However, **no strong evidence** supports a specific time of day for supplementation; consistency is key [^11573bxe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Major guidelines (Endocrine Society, AACE, AGS) **do not specify a time of day** for vitamin D3; they emphasize adherence and daily dosing over intermittent high-dose regimens [^115txpG3] [^114H11RH] [^11573bxe]. Daily dosing maintains stable 25(OH)D and may better support nonclassical pathways than intermittent boluses [^112735xf].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Morning or early afternoon**: Taking vitamin D3 with breakfast or lunch is convenient and supports absorption if the meal contains fat [^114UyADK].
- **Evening dosing**: Generally acceptable, but some report sleep disturbances; avoid late-night dosing if it affects sleep [^notfound].
- **Consistency**: Take it at the same time daily to support adherence and steady levels [^11573bxe].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Obesity or malabsorption**: Higher doses (e.g. 2,000–4,000 IU/day) may be needed; consider 25(OH)D3 if absorption is impaired [^115rP1Fz] [^112X7WPZ].
- **Older adults**: Daily dosing is preferred; intermittent high-dose regimens may increase fall risk [^1153hWLu] [^115txpG3].
- **Pregnancy**: Daily dosing is recommended; no specific time of day is advised.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Factor** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Meal timing | With a fat-containing meal (breakfast or lunch) [^114UyADK] |
| Consistency | Same time daily [^notfound] |
| Dosing frequency | Daily preferred over intermittent high-dose [^115txpG3] [^114H11RH] |
| Special populations | Adjust dose; consider 25(OH)D3 if malabsorption [^112X7WPZ] |

---

The best time to take vitamin D3 is **with a fat-containing meal** (breakfast or lunch) to optimize absorption; if that is not possible, take it with milk or yogurt. Consistency matters more than the exact hour, and daily dosing is preferred for most adults [^114UyADK].

### Vitamin-D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25 (OH) D3 level is a reciprocal phenomenon: a randomized controlled trial [^115b31oE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin-D2 (D2) treatment has been associated with a decrease in 25-hydroxy (25(OH)) vitamin-D3 (D3) level, suggesting that D3 treatment would be preferred to raise total 25(OH) vitamin-D (D) level. We postulated that D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level is related to the increase in 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific, and thus there would be a similar D3 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D2 level.

Methods

Fifty volunteers were block-randomized to 50,000IU D2 or placebo orally once (study-1) and fifty volunteers received 50,000IU D2 orally once and 4days later block-randomized to 50,000IU D3 or placebo orally once (study-2). Interventions were concealed from volunteers and research coordinators and blindly-administered. Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels were blindly-determined at baseline and days 14, 28, 42, and 56, post-randomization by high performance liquid chromatography assay. Results of 97 participants were analyzed. Primary outcome measure was day-28 D2-associated change in 25(OH)D3 level in study-1 and D3-associated change in 25(OH)D2 level in study-2, adjusted for baseline levels.

Results

Mean (95% confidence interval) difference between the active and placebo arms in the decrease in day-28 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 25(OH)D2 (study-2) levels was 13.2 (9.7 to 16.6) and 9.8 (5.2 to 14.4) nmol/L, respectively. Corresponding differences at day-56 were 10.8 (6.8 to 14.8) and 1.7 (-7.6 to 11.1) nmol/L, respectively. The difference between the placebo and active arms in area-under-the-curve at day-28 (AUC 28) and day-56 (AUC 56) were 262.3 (197.8 to 326.7) and 605.1 (446.3 to 784.0) for 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 282.2 (111.2 to 453.3) and 431.2 (179.3 to 683.2) nmol.d/L for 25(OH)D2 (study-2), respectively. There were significant correlations between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels in study-1 (rho = -0.79, p < 0.001) and study-2 (rho = -0.36, p = 0.01), and between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level in study-2 (rho = -0.42, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Compared to placebo, D3 treatment is associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D2 level similar in magnitude to D2-treatment associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level; however, the D3-placebo difference in 25(OH)D2 level is shorter-lasting. Changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels are correlated with each other and with baseline 25 (OH) D levels, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1143e3eh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to neonatal and pediatric patients, vitamin D, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Towards an adequate intake of vitamin D. An advisory report of the health council of the Netherlands [^113uAuTr]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

In this report, the Health Council of the Netherlands advises the government on the best policies to achieve an adequate vitamin D supply for the Dutch population. People with a dark skin, those who spend little time outdoors, pregnant and lactating women, veiled women, elderly and children who do not receive vitamin D supplements or infant formula are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. To improve this, more consistent information about vitamin D should be provided. Spending at least 15 min a day outdoors in combination with a healthy diet generates sufficient vitamin D in children and adults with a light skin. All other groups need additional vitamin D from supplements (10–20 microg/day). Fortified foods can only provide part of the additional vitamin D needed.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^117HkDjt]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in relation to latitude and season — winter ultraviolet-B scarcity and production limits are described: Above 37° north latitude in winter, UV-B photons are decreased by 80% to 100% and little vitamin D3 is produced in skin; a minimum amount of UV-B may not be reached at a latitude of above 40° in winter even with prolonged sun exposure. There are 4 to 5 winter months when vitamin D cannot be produced from UV-B in places such as Boston (42.5° north), and vitamin D levels reach their nadir in February and March in the northern hemisphere.

### Vitamin D3 seems more appropriate than D2 to sustain adequate levels of 25OHD: a pharmacokinetic approach [^116moJpi]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The superiority of cholecalciferol (D3) over ergocalciferol (D2) in sustaining serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels is controversial. To compare D2 with D3 we performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial spanning 11 weeks.

Subjects/Methods

Healthy volunteers (n = 33, aged 33.4 ± 6 years) were divided into three groups (n = 11, each): D2, D3 and placebo. Treatment started with a loading dose (100,000 IU) followed by 4800 IU/day (d) between d7 and d20 and follow-up until d77. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and at days 3, 7, 14, 21, 35, 49, 63 and 77.

Results

Baseline 25OHD values in the D2 group were lower than those in the D3 and placebo groups (P < 0.01). Placebo 25OHD levels never changed. As after the loading dose both D2 and D3 groups had reached similar 25OHD levels, we tested equivalence of the area under the concentration × time curve (AUC) between d7 and d77. The AUC was 28.6% higher for D3 compared with D2, and both were higher with respect to placebo. At d77, D2 25OHD levels were higher than those at baseline, but similar to placebo; both were lower than D3 (P < 0.04). According to raw data, the elimination half-life of 25OHD was 84 and 111 days under D2 and D3 supplementation, respectively; after subtracting the placebo values, the corresponding figures were 33 and 82 days.

Conclusions

D2 and D3 were equally effective in elevating 25OHD levels after a loading dose. In the long term, D3 seems more appropriate for sustaining 25OHD, which could be relevant for classic and non-classic effects of vitamin D.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Q5M89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Vitamin D for the prevention of disease lists population-specific empiric supplementation as follows: Ages 1–18 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" "To prevent nutritional rickets and because of the potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections", Ages 19–49 state "No empiric vitamin D supplementation" with "Follow the Institute of Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance", Ages 50–74 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation", Ages ≥ 75 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of mortality", Pregnancy indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age birth and neonatal mortality", and Prediabetes indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of progression to diabetes". Empiric vitamin D supplementation* is defined on-page as vitamin D (D3 or D2) intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and doses in trials varied so optimal doses remain unclear.

### Lack of effect of calcium intake on the 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to oral vitamin D3 [^115zffqA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to examine the effect of calcium intake on the rise in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in response to supplemental vitamin D(3). Fifty-two healthy older men and women were randomly assigned to take calcium (500 mg twice daily with meals) or placebo tablets for 90 d between October 1 and the end of March. All participants were placed on 800 IU/d (20 microg/d) vitamin D(3). Serum 25(OH)D measurements were made at baseline and on d 30, 60, and 90. The mean baseline 25(OH)D values were 19.2 ± 6.4 ng/ml (47.9 ± 15.9 nmol/liter) in the calcium group and 19.6 ± 6.7 ng/ml (49.1 ± 16.7 nmol/liter) in the control group (P = 0.808). The difference in pattern of change in 25(OH)D was not statistically significant (group by time interaction, P = 0.651); the calcium group increased 6.5 ± 5.9 ng/ml (16.2 ± 14.8 nmol/liter; P < 0.001), and the control group increased 6.6 ± 7.0 ng/ml (16.6 ± 17.4 nmol/liter; P < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for difference in mean increase, calcium vs. control, was -3.8 ± 3.5 ng/ml (-9.6, 8.7) nmol/liter. In older men and women, the level of calcium intake, within the range of 500–1500 mg/d, does not have an important effect on the rise in serum 25(OH)D that occurs in response to 800 IU (20 microg)/d vitamin D(3).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Q65i2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3: relation to circulating vitamin D3 under various input conditions [^111b4unZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Neither the efficiency of the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D nor the steady state relation between vitamin D(3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been studied in humans.

Objective

We aimed to examine the relation between serum vitamin D(3) and 25(OH)D in normal subjects after either oral administration of vitamin D(3) or ultraviolet-B radiation across a broad range of inputs.

Design

Values for serum vitamin D(3) and (OH)D(3) were aggregated from 6 studies — 1 acute and 5 near-steady state — at various vitamin D(3) inputs. In 3 of the steady state studies, vitamin D(3) had been administered for 18–26 wk in doses of 0 to 11000 IU/d; in 2 studies, subjects had received solar or ultraviolet-B irradiation.

Results

In the acute study, subjects receiving a single 100000-IU dose of vitamin D(3) had a rise in serum cholecalciferol to a mean of 521 nmol/L at 1 d and then a fall to near-baseline values by 7–14 d. Serum 25(OH)D peaked at 103 nmol/L on day 7 and fell slowly to baseline by day 112. In the 5 steady state studies, the relation of serum 25(OH)D to serum vitamin D(3) was biphasic and was well described by a combined exponential and linear function: Y = 0.433X + 87.81[1-exp (-0.468X)], with R² = 0.448.

Conclusions

At physiologic inputs, there is rapid conversion of precursor to product at low vitamin D(3) concentrations and a much slower rate of conversion at higher concentrations. These data suggest that, at typical vitamin D(3) inputs and serum concentrations, there is very little native cholecalciferol in the body, and 25(OH)D constitutes the bulk of vitamin D reserves. However, at supraphysiologic inputs, large quantities of vitamin D(3) are stored as the native compound, presumably in body fat, and are slowly released to be converted to 25(OH)D.

### Consensus statement by the American association of clinical endocrinology (AACE) and the American head and neck society endocrine surgery section (AHNS) on pediatric benign and malignant Thyroid surgery [^111ybxCa]. Endocrine Practice (2021). High credibility.

Perioperative management for pediatric thyroidectomy — preoperative iodine, calcitriol/calcium, and postoperative levothyroxine and monitoring are specified as follows: In hyperthyroidism, iodine drops "should be started (1 to 3 drops, three times a day)" "7 to 10 days before surgery". Because "children who undergo total thyroidectomy are at risk for postoperative hypoparathyroidism, treatment with calcitriol (eg, 0.5 μg twice a day), with or without calcium carbonate, for 3 days prior to surgery can be considered", and "Preoperative supplementation with vitamin D3 appears particularly prudent if a vitamin D deficiency is identified in advance". For low dietary calcium, "supplemental calcium (500–1000 mg of elemental calcium, three times a day) may be added preoperatively". Postoperatively, "calcium levels should be followed. If hypocalcemia and not already taking calcitriol, it should be initiated (0.5 μg twice a day)", and "Serum calcium and phosphorus should be monitored weekly until calcitriol is discontinued". "Following total thyroidectomy, levothyroxine should be started the day after surgery at a weight-appropriate dose (1.5–2.0 μg/kg/day)". "Thyroid levels should be checked within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation and any subsequent dose changes", and "No sooner than 6 weeks after surgery, cancer evaluation should be performed".

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^112guEFx]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. There is a multitude of causes of vitamin D deficiency, but the major cause has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other health agencies. It is likely that our hunter gatherer fore-fathers being exposed to sunlight on a daily basis were making several thousand IU of vitamin D a day. The fact that 100 IU of vitamin D prevented overt signs of rickets led to the false security that ingesting twice this amount was more than adequate to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirement. Although this may be true for preventing overt skeletal deformities associated with rickets, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. The likely reason is that essentially every tissue and cell in the body has a VDR and thus, to have enough vitamin D to satisfy all of these cellular requirements, the blood level of 25(OH)D needs to be above 30 ng/mL. It has been estimated that for every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested that the blood level of 25(OH)D increases by 1 ng/mL. Thus to theoretically achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. There is evidence, however, that when the blood levels of 25(OH)D are less than 15 ng/mL, the body is able to more efficiently use vitamin D to raise the blood level to about 20 ng/mL. To raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 100 IU of vitamin D for every 1-ng increase; therefore to increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D a day for adults. There is a great need to significantly increase the recommended adequate intakes of vitamin D. All neonates during the first year of life should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D, and increasing it to 1000 IU/d may provide additional health benefits. Children 1 year and older should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D as recently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but they should consider increasing intake up to 2000 IU/d derive maximum health benefits from vitamin D. Prepubertal and teenage girls who received 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for a year showed improvement in their musculoskeletal health with no untoward toxicity. All adults should be taking 2000 IU of vitamin D per day. A recent study reported that adults who took 50,000 IU of vitamin D once every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to taking 3000 IU of vitamin D a day, for up to 6 years was effective in maintaining blood levels of 25(OH)D of between 40 and 60 ng/mL without any toxicity. There is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake, with the exception of acquired disorders such as granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as well as some lymphomas with activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)₂D₃ in an unregulated fashion.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^113Raj3k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) was published by National Heart and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Vitamin D deficiency. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients? In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the population was: 1078 patients (467 female, 611 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. The key exclusion criteria were an inability to take an enteral drug, a history of kidney stones, the presence of hypercalcemia at baseline, and informed consent not being obtained in a timely manner. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the interventions were: n = 538 vitamin D (a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization) n = 540 placebo (matched placebo in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days (23.5% vs. 20.6%; AD 2.9%, 95% CI -2.1 to 7.9). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in in-hospital mortality at 90 days (17.1% vs. 13.4%; AD 3.7%, 95% CI -0.5 to 8) Borderline significant decrease in hospital length of stay at 90 days (9.1 days vs. 10.4 days; AD -1.4 days, 95% CI -2.7 to 0) No significant difference in ventilator-free days at 28 days (21.3 days vs. 22.1 days; AD -0.8 days, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.5). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious and nonserious adverse events, hypercalcemia, kidney stones, fall-related fractures. significant difference in total calcium level at 14 days (8.9 mg/dl vs. 8.8 mg/dl). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause mortality at 90 days.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in adults [^113Gd1nz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Available evidence on the effects of vitamin D on mortality has been inconclusive. In a recent systematic review, we found evidence that vitamin D3 may decrease mortality in mostly elderly women. The present systematic review updates and reassesses the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation used in primary and secondary prophylaxis of mortality.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in healthy adults and adults in a stable phase of disease.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index-Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (all up to February 2012). We checked references of included trials and pharmaceutical companies for unidentified relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared any type of vitamin D in any dose with any duration and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adult participants. Participants could have been recruited from the general population or from patients diagnosed with a disease in a stable phase. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)) or as an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Six review authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). To account for trials with zero events, we performed meta-analyses of dichotomous data using risk differences (RDs) and empirical continuity corrections. We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimise the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Trial sequential analyses controlled the risk of random errors possibly caused by cumulative meta-analyses.

Main Results

We identified 159 randomised clinical trials. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Participants in 19 trials had vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL). Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I² = 0%). More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I² = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men. Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I² = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted.

### Effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep in the healthy population: interpretations from the serotonergic pathway [^1114G3tK]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in the healthy population. Recent insights addressed the role of vitamin D in serotonin and melatonin regulation, suggesting that increasing vitamin D status may be helpful for improving mood and sleep. This literature review covers the current state of evidence regarding potential effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep indicators in healthy people. In total, 11 observational studies were found for sleep, and 54 studies on mood (including ten RCTs). These studies revealed mixed results for both sleep and mood. The findings were interpreted based on the previously proposed serotonergic pathway of vitamin D. Implications and challenges for future research regarding the timing of blood sampling, timing and dosage of supplement intake and investigating the response dynamics are discussed.

Vitamin D use in nonpregnant adults aged < 50 years — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. Technical remark: This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily). Background notes that levels of 25(OH)D lower than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) were seen in 14% of Europeans and lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in 40%, and in the United States, 24% and 6% of adults have 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), respectively; numerous studies have found associations between low 25(OH)D levels, low BMD, and fractures, low 25(OH)D levels have also been associated with fatigue and higher risks for respiratory infections, and the age span of 18 to 50 years is when peak bone mass occurs.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Comparative analysis of nutritional guidelines for vitamin D [^114m7n7G]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is essential for calcium and bone homeostasis. Humans are largely dependent on UVB-radiation-induced photosynthesis of vitamin D, as few foods contain vitamin D. However, the same radiation that produces vitamin D is also carcinogenic, albeit with a long lag time, and causes DNA damage. In view of the increasing life expectancy, avoiding excessive sun exposure is prudent. Several groups of people have a shortfall between their requirements for vitamin D and their combined endogenous synthesis and intake from natural foods, and therefore need vitamin D supplementation. Governments and scientific societies are regularly updating their recommendations for intake of vitamin D, especially for groups that should (infants) or prefer to (especially elderly individuals) avoid direct sunlight. An overview of such guidelines is presented in this Review. A fairly large consensus exists that all infants should receive 400 international units (IU) (10 μg) daily during their first year of life and that elderly individuals should have access to vitamin D supplementation (at recommended dosages varying from 400 IU to 800 IU daily in most governmental guidelines but at higher dosages in other guidelines). All guidelines unanimously agree that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) < 25 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) should be avoided at all ages. Children and adults who have limited sun exposure should receive vitamin D supplementation, but the recommended doses vary widely (from 200 IU to 2,000 IU daily), in line with disagreement regarding the minimal desirable serum concentration of 25OHD (which varies from 25 nmol/l to > 100 nmol/l).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF, age greater than 12 months to 10 yr, be treated with an initial dose of 800–1,000 IU vitamin D3 per day. The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF, age greater than 12 months to 10 yr, with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) but less than 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), and with confirmed adherence to the prescribed regimen, have the dose of vitamin D3 increased to 1,600–3,000 IU per day. The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF, age greater than 12 months to 10 yr, with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) or with a persistent serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) but less than 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), and with confirmed adherence to the prescribed regimen, have the dose of vitamin D3 increased to a maximum of 4,000 IU per day. The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF, age greater than 12 months to 10 yr, who are unable to achieve a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) after treatment with 4,000 IU vitamin D3 per day, and with confirmed adherence to the prescribed regimen, be managed in consultation with a specialist with expertise in vitamin D therapy.

Take FOSAMAX PLUS D at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking FOSAMAX PLUS D with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate by decreasing its absorption into the body.
Take FOSAMAX PLUS D upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a FOSAMAX PLUS D tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6–8 ounces). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. FOSAMAX PLUS D should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)].

### Does vitamin D3 dosing schedule influence treatment efficacy in nursing home residents with vitamin D deficiency? [^115uenka]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem among elderly nursing home residents. In this Practice Point commentary, I discuss the findings and limitations of a randomized, controlled trial by Chel et al. that evaluated the effect of equivalent oral doses of vitamin D(3) given as 600 IU daily, 4,200 IU weekly or 18,000 IU monthly. Regardless of the dosing schedule, oral administration of vitamin D(3) was associated with increased levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and reduced levels of parathyroid hormone in the study cohort. Daily administration of vitamin D(3) was found to be more effective than either weekly or monthly administration. The addition of calcium supplementation for a 2-week period did not appreciably augment the effects of vitamin D(3) supplementation. Here, I highlight the issues to consider when interpreting studies of vitamin D(3) supplementation, its effect on vitamin D status, and the consequences for calcium and bone metabolism.

CKD-MBD decision-making and assay considerations — In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, we recommend that therapeutic decisions be based on trends, rather than a single laboratory value, taking into account all available CKD-MBD assessments (1C). This statement recommends assessing all parameters of CKD-MBD together and each parameter over time, and the practitioner should account for assay and timing factors: PTH and phosphorus levels are subject to diurnal variation and vitamin D levels are subject to seasonal variation; testing for PTH and phosphorus should be performed at similar times during the day and week, and to eliminate between-assay variability, the same assay should be used for monitoring changes over time. This recommendation is applicable to the United States.

### Efficacy and safety of vitamin D3 intake exceeding the lowest observed adverse effect level [^114PiFje]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences states that 95 microg vitamin D/d is the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL).

Objective

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of prolonged vitamin D3 intakes of 25 and 100 microg (1000 and 4000 IU)/d. Efficacy was based on the lowest serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration achieved by subjects taking vitamin D3; potential toxicity was monitored by measuring serum calcium concentrations and by calculating urinary calcium-creatinine ratios.

Design

Healthy men and women (n = 61) aged 41 ± 9 y (mean ± SD) were randomly assigned to receive either 25 or 100 microg vitamin D3/d for 2–5 mo, starting between January and February. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay.

Results

Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 40.7 ± 15.4 nmol/L (mean ± SD). From 3 mo on, serum 25(OH)D plateaued at 68.7 ± 16.9 nmol/L in the 25-microg/d group and at 96.4 ± 14.6 nmol/L in the 100-microg/d group. Summertime serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 25 comparable subjects not taking vitamin D3 were 46.7 ± 17.8 nmol/L. The minimum and maximum plateau serum 25(OH)D concentrations in subjects taking 25 and 100 microg vitamin D3/d were 40 and 100 nmol/L and 69 and 125 nmol/L, respectively. Serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion did not change significantly at either dosage during the study.

Conclusions

The 100-microg/d dosage of vitamin D3 effectively increased 25(OH)D to high-normal concentrations in practically all adults and serum 25(OH)D remained within the physiologic range; therefore, we consider 100 microg vitamin D3/d to be a safe intake.

### Estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin D in healthy adults [^111H2bJs]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge gaps have contributed to considerable variation among international dietary recommendations for vitamin D.

Objective

We aimed to establish the distribution of dietary vitamin D required to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above several proposed cutoffs (ie, 25, 37.5, 50, and 80 nmol/L) during wintertime after adjustment for the effect of summer sunshine exposure and diet.

Design

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 22-wk intervention study was conducted in men and women aged 20–40 y (n = 238) by using different supplemental doses (0, 5, 10, and 15 microg/d) of vitamin D(3) throughout the winter. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by using enzyme-linked immunoassay at baseline (October 2006) and endpoint (March 2007).

Results

There were clear dose-related increments (P < 0.0001) in serum 25(OH)D with increasing supplemental vitamin D(3). The slope of the relation between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D was 1.96 nmol x L(-1) x microg(-1) intake. The vitamin D intake that maintained serum 25(OH)D concentrations of > 25 nmol/L in 97.5% of the sample was 8.7 microg/d. This intake ranged from 7.2 microg/d in those who enjoyed sunshine exposure, 8.8 microg/d in those who sometimes had sun exposure, and 12.3 microg/d in those who avoided sunshine. Vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations of > 37.5, > 50, and > 80 nmol/L in 97.5% of the sample were 19.9, 28.0, and 41.1 microg/d, respectively.

Conclusion

The range of vitamin D intakes required to ensure maintenance of wintertime vitamin D status [as defined by incremental cutoffs of serum 25(OH)D] in the vast majority (> 97.5%) of 20–40-y-old adults, considering a variety of sun exposure preferences, is between 7.2 and 41.1 microg/d.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UcKko]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Considerations for empiric vitamin D — formulation, availability, cost, and equity note that most multivitamins contain 800 to 1000 IU (20 to 25 μg) of vitamin D, vitamin D is inexpensive and available without a prescription at costs varying from the equivalent of US $10 to $50 per year, and a daily empiric supplement was judged acceptable and feasible. Most vitamin D3 is from animal sources with vegan vitamin D3 from lichen also available; vitamin D2 is plant-based, widely available, and costs are similar. When benefits were identified, the panel judged empiric vitamin D will not likely have a negative impact on health equity and may have a favorable impact on improving health equity, and disadvantaged persons tend to be at higher baseline risk for many assessed outcomes so greater absolute benefit would be expected when benefit is present.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114GVfYj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 6 — general population aged 75 years and older: In the general population aged 75 years and older, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation because of the potential to lower the risk of mortality. Empiric vitamin D may include daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D and/or daily intake of a vitamin D supplement, and for empiric supplementation, daily, lower-dose vitamin D is preferred over nondaily, higher doses. In trials informing this recommendation, vitamin D dosage ranged from 400 to 3333 IU [10 to 83 μg] daily equivalent; the estimated weighted average was approximately 900 IU (23 μg) daily, and participants in many trials were allowed to remain on routine supplements, including up to 800 IU (20 μg) of vitamin D daily.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D intake and dosing patterns emphasize that many scientific organizations recommend intake of at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults aged 50 years and older, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) suggest 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day as the safe upper limit in the general population; a meta-analysis in postmenopausal women found fracture reduction at doses of 700 to 800 IU/day or more. In frail elderly adults, monthly bolus regimens including 24,000 IU of vitamin D3, 60,000 IU of vitamin D3, or 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol were associated with increased falls, supporting that caution should be used with bolus dosing, and single, larger annual bolus doses are also not recommended where 500,000 IU of vitamin D3 was given annually in women with risk factors for hip fracture (median age of 76 years and baseline median 25(OH)D level of 21 ng/mL). Mechanistically, a single vitamin D3 dose of 150,000 IU led to greater 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than daily dosing of 5,000 IU for 1 month.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1114js6Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — empiric vitamin D use and 25(OH)D testing: The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years, for adults aged 75 years and older, for those who are pregnant, and for those with high‑risk prediabetes because of its potential to lower disease risks noted on the page. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests daily administration rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower disease risk in healthy adults younger than 75 years, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered because routine screening lacks supporting clinical trial evidence (including in those with obesity or dark complexion) and no clear preventive target level was identified. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs and do not apply to those with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting therapy with FOSAMAX PLUS D and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed.

17.1 Osteoporosis Recommendations, Including Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if intake is inadequate. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) should take additional vitamin D if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require additional vitamin D supplementation. Weight-bearing exercise should be considered along with the modification of certain behavioral factors, such as cigarette smoking and/or excessive alcohol consumption, if these factors exist.

17.2 Dosing Instructions

Instruct patients that the expected benefits of FOSAMAX PLUS D may only be obtained when it is taken with plain water the first thing upon arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Even dosing with orange juice or coffee has been shown to markedly reduce the absorption of alendronate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Instruct patients not to chew or suck on the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.

Instruct patients to swallow each tablet of FOSAMAX PLUS D with a full glass of water (6–8 ounces) and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day to facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation.

Instruct patients not to take FOSAMAX PLUS D at bedtime or before arising for the day. Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of esophageal problems.

Instruct patients that if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or pain upon swallowing, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn) they should stop taking FOSAMAX PLUS D and consult their physician.

If patients miss a dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### The optimal dosage regimen of vitamin D supplementation for correcting deficiency in adolescents: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^114WEpWb]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitamin D deficiency is common in adolescents but the optimal dosage regimen for correcting deficiency is unknown. To test the safety and efficacy of two different vitamin D dosage regimens to correct vitamin D deficiency in adolescents.

Subjects/Methods

In this 12-month, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 28 adolescents (serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of 21 to 50 nmol/L) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: monthly (n = 9; vitamin D3 50,000IU orally monthly plus three placebo tablets 3-monthly), 3-monthly (n = 9; 150,000IU (3×50,000IU tablets) 3-monthly and placebo orally monthly), or placebo (n = 10; placebo monthly and three placebo tablets 3-monthly). Serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

Results

Two participants withdrew after their baseline measurement from the 3-monthly group. At 12 months, one participant was deficient (≤ 50nmol/L) in both the monthly and 3-monthly groups, whereas six out of ten in the placebo remained deficient (P = 0.055). At 12 months, the average serum 25(OH)D levels for the monthly, 3-monthly and placebo groups were 76.4, 64.7 and 49.7 nmol/L, respectively (P < 0.001 and P = 0.04 for differences between monthly and placebo groups and 3-monthly and placebo groups respectively, after adjustment for age, sex and seasonal variation). Adherence was 100% and adverse events were minor.

Conclusions

Both 50,000IU monthly and 150,000IU 3-monthly of vitamin D3 safely and effectively corrects vitamin D deficiency in adolescents. These data provide treatment options which can be used by health practitioners to tailor vitamin D dosage regiments according to patient preference and context.

### How well are the optimal serum 25OHD concentrations reached in high-dose intermittent vitamin D therapy? a placebo-controlled study on comparison between 100 000 IU and 200 000 IU of oral D3 every 3 months in elderly women [^1158fn2j]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Intermittent dosing may improve adherence to vitamin D therapy. Dosing regimen should maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels over all the year. We compared two dosing regimens, the primary outcome being the percentage of 25OHD measurements reaching the targets of 75 nmol/l or 50 nmol/l after baseline.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group comparison.

Patients

Sixty women aged 75.0 ± 2.9 years.

Interventions

100 000 IU (group 1D) or 200 000 IU (2D) of vitamin D3 or placebo orally every 3 months plus calcium 1 g daily for 1 year.

Measurements

Serum 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTH, sclerostin, ionized calcium, urinary calcium, renal function, bone turnover markers.

Results

Serum 25OHD increased, but the difference between two doses was of borderline significance (P = 0.0554; area under curve analysis). Immediate postadministrative increases were higher in the 2D vs 1D group (P < 0.05) after 3 and 6 months' dosing. In the 1D and 2D groups, 51.2% and 57.7% of all on-treatment measurements reached the target of 75 nmol/l. PTH levels differed marginally (P = 0.0759) due to tendency to lowering immediately after vitamin D boluses. Urinary calcium differed between the groups (P = 0.0193) due to increases 1 week after vitamin D dosing.

Conclusions

The doses of 100 000 or 200 000 IU of oral cholecalciferol every 3 months were not capable of stabilizing 25OHD levels over the target of 75 nmol/l over the year. To improve the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D therapy, the interval between boluses has to be shortened instead of increasing their size.

### Influence of vitamin D supplementation by sunlight or oral D3 on exercise performance [^117LZt9N]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the relationship between vitamin D status and exercise performance in a large, prospective cohort study of young men and women across seasons (study 1). Then, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, to investigate the effects on exercise performance of achieving vitamin D sufficiency (serum 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol·L) by a unique comparison of safe, simulated-sunlight and oral vitamin D3 supplementation in wintertime (study 2).

Methods

In study 1, we determined 25(OH)D relationship with exercise performance in 967 military recruits. In study 2, 137 men received either placebo, simulated sunlight (1.3× standard erythemal dose in T-shirt and shorts, three times per week for 4 wk and then once per week for 8 wk) or oral vitamin D3 (1000 IU·d for 4 wk and then 400 IU·d for 8 wk). We measured serum 25(OH)D by high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and endurance, strength and power by 1.5-mile run, maximum dynamic lift and vertical jump, respectively.

Results

In study 1, only 9% of men and 36% of women were vitamin D sufficient during wintertime. After controlling for body composition, smoking, and season, 25(OH)D was positively associated with endurance performance (P ≤ 0.01, ΔR = 0.03–0.06, small f effect sizes): 1.5-mile run time was ~half a second faster for every 1 nmol·L increase in 25(OH)D. No significant effects on strength or power emerged (P > 0.05). In study 2, safe simulated sunlight and oral vitamin D3 supplementation were similarly effective in achieving vitamin D sufficiency in almost all (97%); however, this did not improve exercise performance (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Vitamin D status was associated with endurance performance but not strength or power in a prospective cohort study. Achieving vitamin D sufficiency via safe, simulated summer sunlight, or oral vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve exercise performance in a randomized-controlled trial.

### Clinical review: the role of the parent compound vitamin D with respect to metabolism and function: why clinical dose intervals can affect clinical outcomes [^112735xf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

There is no doubt that vitamin D must be activated to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to achieve full biological activity or that many tissues participate in this activation process-be it endocrine or autocrine. We believe that not only is 25-hydroxyvitamin D important to tissue delivery for this activation process, but also that intact vitamin D has a pivotal role in this process.

Objective

In this review, evidence on the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system is presented and discussed in relation to vitamin D-binding protein affinity, circulating half-lives, and enzymatic transformations of vitamin D metabolites, and how these affect biological action in any given tissue.

Conclusions

Circulating vitamin D, the parent compound, likely plays an important physiological role with respect to the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system, as a substrate in many tissues, not originally thought to be important. Based on emerging data from the laboratory, clinical trials, and data on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D amassed during many decades, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of these systems, significant vitamin D should be available on a daily basis to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^1114hFbb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2+25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D assessment and therapy specify that an individual's vitamin D status is assessed by serum 25(OH)D, and adults who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient (serum 25[OH]D 20 to 29 or < 20 ng/mL, respectively) may receive 50,000 IU vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for 6 to 8 weeks to achieve a 25(OH)D blood level > 30 ng/mL; the above-noted replacement regimen should be followed by maintenance therapy of 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3, daily. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) rather than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) should be used for replacement, and a higher dose may be required in patients with obesity or malabsorption and those on medications affecting metabolism of vitamin D. Not every 25(OH)D assay measures 25(OH)D2 and, due to unequal cross-reactivity, many current assays are inaccurate if there is a significant amount of 25(OH)D2; therefore, use of an appropriate assay, generally one performed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry that accurately quantifies both 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is essential, and in patients with active granulomatous disease, replacement of vitamin D must be undertaken with caution due to risk for hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia.

### Meal conditions affect the absorption of supplemental vitamin D3 but not the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to supplementation [^111C7tpQ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

It is sometimes assumed that dietary fat is required for vitamin D absorption, although the impact of different amounts of dietary fat on vitamin D absorption is not established. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of a meal and the fat content of the meal influences vitamin D absorption or the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] response to supplemental vitamin D3. Based on earlier studies in rats we postulated that absorption would be greatest in the low-fat meal group. Sixty-two healthy older men and women were randomly assigned to one of three meal groups: no meal, high-fat meal, or low-fat meal; each was given a monthly 50,000 IU vitamin D3 supplement with the test breakfast meal (or after a fast for the no-meal group) and followed for 90 days. Plasma vitamin D3 was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) before and 12 hours after the first dose; plasma 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline and after 30 and 90 days. The mean 12-hour increments in vitamin D3, after adjusting for age and sex, were 200.9 nmol/L in the no-meal group, 207.4 nmol/L in the high-fat meal group, and 241.1 nmol/L in the low-fat meal group (p = 0.038), with the increase in the low-fat group being significantly greater than the increases in the other two groups. However, increments in 25(OH)D levels at 30 and 90 days did not differ significantly in the three groups. We conclude that absorption was increased when a 50,000 IU dose of vitamin D was taken with a low-fat meal, compared with a high-fat meal and no meal, but that the greater absorption did not result in higher plasma 25(OH)D levels in the low-fat meal group.

### The effect of a single, large bolus of vitamin D in healthy adults over the winter and following year: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1124VTne]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Although single, high doses of vitamin D effectively maintain vitamin D sufficiency in several populations, no studies have evaluated healthy adults over winter, during which vitamin D status declines. This study investigated whether high-dose vitamin D3 given once to healthy adults before winter will (1) prevent the wintertime decline in vitamin D status, (2) promote vitamin D sufficiency 1 year following the dose and (3) prevent the rise of parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations.

Subjects/Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed plasma 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations at baseline, 5, 90 and 365 days after drug administration in 28 healthy adults. In all, > 80% of subjects returned at each time point.

Results

At baseline, the young, healthy participants had a mean plasma 25(OH)D concentration of 17.5 ± 6.1ng/ml. Only two subjects exhibited plasma 25(OH)D concentrations > 30ng/ml. At 5 days, subjects randomized to vitamin D3 had a higher mean plasma 25(OH)D concentration compared with the placebo group (39.1 vs 19.1ng/ml, P < 0.001). Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations returned to baseline at 90 and 365 days in the vitamin D3 group and remained unchanged in the placebo group. PTH and calcium concentrations were unrelated to changes in 25(OH)D levels and similar between groups over time.

Conclusions

A dose of 250,000IU of vitamin D3 given once in November resulted in a robust increase in plasma 25(OH)D after 5 days, but it was unable to sustain this increase after 90 days. A larger or more frequent dosing regimen may be needed for long-term vitamin D sufficiency.

### Taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [^1159DyFD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Many patients treated for vitamin D deficiency fail to achieve an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] despite high doses of ergo- or cholecalciferol. The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day would improve absorption and increase serum levels of 25(OH)D. This was a prospective cohort study in an ambulatory tertiary-care referral center. Patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Bone Clinic for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency who were not responding to treatment make up the study group. Subjects were instructed to take their usual vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day. The main outcome measure was the serum 259(OH)D level after 2 to 3 months. Seventeen patients were analyzed. The mean age (± SD) and sex (F/M) ratio were 64.5 ± 11.0 years and 13 females and 4 males, respectively. The dose of 25(OH)D ranged from 1000 to 50,000 IU daily. The mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level (± SD) was 30.5 ± 4.7 ng/mL (range 21.6 to 38.8 ng/mL). The mean serum 25(OH)D level after diet modification (± SD) was 47.2 ± 10.9 ng/mL (range 34.7 to 74.0 ng/mL, p < .01). Overall, the average serum 25(OH)D level increased by 56.7% ± 36.7%. A subgroup analysis based on the weekly dose of vitamin D was performed, and a similar trend was observed. Thus it is concluded that taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in about a 50% increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D levels achieved. Similar increases were observed in a wide range of vitamin D doses taken for a variety of medical conditions.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^116p9JkA]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric vitamin D deficiency — replacement dosing and high‑dose (stoss) options are described as follows. Vitamin D given in daily doses of 25 to 250 µg (1000–10 000 IU) can be used for a 2- to 3-month period. Our recommendation is to use doses of 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for infants 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old. With therapy, radiologic evidence of healing is observed in 2 to 4 weeks, after which the dose of vitamin D can be reduced to 400 IU/day. An option after the first month of life is a single administration of high doses (100 000–600 000 IU over 1–5 days), which may need to be intermittently repeated (usually every 3 months). As examples of stoss schedules, 100 000 IU of vitamin D every 2 hours over a 12-hour period has been reported, and in teenagers and adults, 50 000 IU of vitamin D has been administered orally once per week for 8 weeks.

### A pilot-randomized, double-blind crossover trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of orally administered 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and vitamin D3 in healthy adults with differing BMI and in adults with intestinal malabsorption [^112X7WPZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Obese and malabsorptive patients have difficulty increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] after taking vitamin D supplementation. Since 25(OH)D is more hydrophilic than vitamin D, we hypothesized that oral 25(OH)D supplementation is more effective in increasing serum 25(OH)D concentrations in these patients.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and oral vitamin D3 in healthy participants with differing BMI and malabsorptive patients.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind crossover trial was performed in 6 malabsorptive patients and 10 healthy participants who were given 900 µg of either vitamin D3 or 25(OH)D3 orally followed by a pharmacokinetic study (PKS). After ≥ 28 d from the first dosing, each participant returned to receive the other form of vitamin D and undergo another PKS. For each PKS, serum vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 were measured at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h and days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.

Results

Data were expressed as means ± SEMs. The PKS of 900 µg vitamin D3 revealed that malabsorptive patients had 64% lower AUC than healthy participants (1177 ± 425 vs. 3258 ± 496 ng · h/mL; P < 0.05). AUCs of 900 µg 25(OH)D3 were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.540). The 10 healthy participants were ranked by BMI and categorized into higher/lower BMI groups (5/group). The PKS of 900 µg vitamin D3 showed that the higher BMI group had 53% lower AUC than the lower BMI group (2089 ± 490 vs. 4427 ± 313 ng · h/mL; P < 0.05), whereas AUCs of 900 µg 25(OH)D3 were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.500).

Conclusions

Oral 25(OH)D3 may be a good choice for managing vitamin D deficiency in malabsorption and obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as (NCT03401541.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Dietary vitamin D intake for the elderly population: update on the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D [^113DJKWN]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency can be diagnosed with measurements of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). Most vitamin D is derived from sunlight (80%), so serum 25OHD levels are lowest in late winter and early spring. Dietary vitamin D in North America is small, about 100 to 200 IU daily. A recent review of the literature shows many association studies relating vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency to several diseases. Large randomized trials of vitamin D are underway and soon there may be answers as to whether vitamin D is clinically effective and what level of serum 25OHD is necessary.

### Comparison of daily, weekly, and monthly vitamin D3 in ethanol dosing protocols for two months in elderly hip fracture patients [^117HiHau]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Different dosing protocols have been used for vitamin D supplementation, but there has been a lack of comparative data among them.

Objective

Our objective was to determine whether the same cumulative dose of vitamin D3 produces different effects if it is given daily, weekly, or monthly.

Design

Women, age 81 ± 8 yr (± sd, n = 48), who had undergone surgery to repair hip fracture were randomized to vitamin D3-supplementation protocols at 1,500 IU daily, or 10,500 IU once weekly, or 45,000 IU once every 28 d. The primary outcome measure was the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration attained.

Results

Initially, serum 25(OH)D concentrations for daily, weekly, and monthly groups were, respectively, 15.13 ± 6.9, 15.7 ± 10.1, and 16.2 ± 10.1 ng/ml. By d 7, these had increased significantly in all the groups (P < 0.001). On the first day after the monthly dose, both serum 25(OH)D and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D had increased significantly (P < 0.012 each), whereas these did not change significantly on the day after daily or weekly doses. After 2 months, serum 25(OH)D with daily, weekly, and monthly dosing were, respectively, 33.2 ± 8.5, 29.2 ± 8.9, and 37.1 ± 10.3 ng/ml; there were no significant differences among these values.

Conclusions

Supplementation with vitamin D can be achieved equally well with daily, weekly, or monthly dosing frequencies. Therefore, the choice of dose frequency can be based on whichever approach will optimize an individual's adherence with long-term vitamin D supplementation.

Sources of vitamin D and cutaneous synthesis — "Most circulating vitamin D is synthesized from skin exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation", and "Vitamin D synthesis by the skin is the main source of this prohormone for most people", with forms distinguished because "Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant derived, whereas vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by animals". Mechanistically, "7-Dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D) is a relatively rigid, 4-ringed structure" in epidermal membranes and "Exposure to UV-B in the wavelengths of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D", after which "Previtamin D isomerizes to vitamin D and then is transferred to extracellular space and dermal capillaries, where it binds with vitamin D–binding protein (DBP)". The complex is "transported to the liver for 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)-D (calcidiol)", with subsequent renal steps whereby "25(OH)-D is released into the circulation and transported to the kidney bound to DBP for 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2-D and for 24-hydroxylation to 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)₂-D]", noting that "1,25(OH)₂-D (calcitriol) is the active form of vitamin D" and that "Nuclear receptors for 1,25(OH)2-D are present in > 30 tissues".
