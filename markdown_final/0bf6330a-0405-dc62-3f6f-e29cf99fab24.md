## Question

What to do with lipase at 73 on labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a lipase level of 73 U/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory's reference range and whether 73 U/L is normal or elevated. Then, I should verify the diagnostic threshold for acute pancreatitis and whether this value meets it. Next, I will consider clinical context, especially abdominal pain and imaging, to apply the 2-of-3 diagnostic criteria. After that, I need to check for non-pancreatitic causes of mild lipase elevation and decide if any additional tests are warranted. Finally, I will outline management pathways if acute pancreatitis is unlikely versus if it remains a concern, and I will double-check for any exceptions like renal failure or macro-lipase that could confound interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the reference range, because I need to ensure I am not overcalling an abnormality. Most clinical laboratories report a normal lipase range of about 10–60 U/L, so 73 U/L represents a mild elevation of roughly 1.2 times the upper limit of normal, which is not in the diagnostic range for acute pancreatitis by itself [^24e09476].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold before drawing conclusions. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of three features: characteristic abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings; thus, a lipase of 73 U/L does not meet the biochemical criterion, and pancreatitis cannot be diagnosed on this lab value alone [^24e09476] [^1edb62d5] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should integrate symptoms and imaging. If the patient has typical epigastric pain radiating to the back, I would still not label this as pancreatitis without either a lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN or confirmatory imaging, so I would observe, provide analgesia, and reassess rather than immediately ordering a CT, which is not indicated early unless the diagnosis is uncertain or the patient fails to improve [^1edb62d5] [^4abb455c].

> I need to check for non-pancreatitic causes of mild lipase elevation, because specificity is limited and small increases are common in other conditions. Mild hyperlipasemia can occur with renal insufficiency, biliary disease, bowel obstruction or ischemia, macrolipase, and even in asymptomatic individuals, so I should review the history, exam, and basic labs including renal function, liver tests, and electrolytes before attributing significance to a lipase of 73 U/L [^881aac47] [^2f59e0c8] [^06cad770].

> Let me consider medication and metabolic contributors, since I should confirm reversible drivers. GLP-1 receptor agonists and other incretin-based therapies can cause modest lipase elevations without pancreatitis, and hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis typically requires triglycerides above 1,000 mg/dL, so I should ask about diabetes drugs and, if pancreatitis remains a concern, obtain fasting lipids, but a lipase of 73 U/L is not suggestive of hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis by itself [^caf6b589] [^a53c8def] [^3de8fada].

> Next, I should review whether any additional testing is warranted now. If the patient is asymptomatic and has no red flags, repeating lipase is generally unnecessary because isolated mild elevations are nonspecific; if symptoms persist or evolve, I would repeat lipase with amylase, comprehensive metabolic panel, and consider imaging only if the diagnosis remains unclear or the patient deteriorates, keeping in mind that early CT rarely changes management in straightforward cases [^1edb62d5] [^4abb455c].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis or has chronic kidney disease; could this explain the elevation. Yes, renal failure can elevate lipase due to impaired clearance, so in CKD I would interpret a value of 73 U/L as even less specific and avoid overdiagnosing pancreatitis without corroborating clinical and imaging data [^06cad770].

> I should double-check for assay interference or macrolipase if the lipase remains chronically elevated without symptoms. In that scenario, I would consider polyethylene glycol precipitation or discuss with the laboratory to exclude macrolipase, which can cause persistent, non-pathologic lipase elevations that do not reflect true pancreatic injury [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the management pathways. If the patient has no compatible abdominal pain and no concerning features, I would treat this as a nonspecific lab abnormality, address reversible contributors, and avoid further pancreatic imaging or enzyme testing. If the patient has concerning abdominal pain but still lacks the biochemical or imaging criteria, I would observe, provide analgesia, ensure adequate hydration, and reassess clinically, reserving imaging for diagnostic uncertainty or lack of improvement. If the patient later meets two of three criteria, I would proceed with acute pancreatitis management and etiologic workup accordingly [^1edb62d5] [^4abb455c].

> In summary, I should confirm that a lipase of 73 U/L is a mild, nonspecific elevation that does not establish acute pancreatitis by itself. The next step is to correlate with symptoms and, if needed, imaging, while evaluating for common non-pancreatitic causes and avoiding unnecessary early CT or serial enzyme checks unless the clinical course demands it [^24e09476] [^1edb62d5] [^881aac47].

---

A lipase of 73 U/L is a **mild elevation** and not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis, which requires a level ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (typically ≥ 180 U/L) plus compatible symptoms or imaging [^24e09476] [^1edb62d5]. This degree of elevation is **nonspecific** and can occur in renal impairment, biliary disease, intestinal ischemia, or with certain medications [^881aac47] [^2f59e0c8]. If the patient is asymptomatic, **no immediate action is needed**; if symptomatic, assess for pancreatitis with history, exam, and targeted labs (amylase, liver enzymes, triglycerides, calcium, renal function) [^1edb62d5], and reserve imaging for persistent or severe symptoms or diagnostic uncertainty [^1edb62d5]. Repeat lipase only if clinically indicated, and avoid serial testing unless it will change management [^9667340c].

---

## Clinical significance of lipase 73 U/L

- **Normal reference range**: Typically 10–60 U/L, though varies by lab.
- **Mild elevation**: 73 U/L is ~1.2× ULN and not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis.
- **Diagnostic threshold**: Acute pancreatitis requires lipase ≥ 3× ULN (usually ≥ 180 U/L) plus symptoms or imaging [^24e09476] [^1edb62d5].

---

## Common causes of mild lipase elevation

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Pancreatic | - Chronic pancreatitis <br/> - Pancreatic pseudocyst <br/> - Pancreatic cancer (less common) |
| Non-pancreatic gastrointestinal | - Biliary obstruction <br/> - Cholecystitis <br/> - Bowel obstruction <br/> - Intestinal ischemia <br/> - Peptic ulcer disease |
| Renal | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Acute kidney injury (reduced clearance) |
| Medications | - GLP-1 agonists (e.g. semaglutide) <br/> - Thiazides <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Azathioprine |
| Other | - Macroamylasemia/macrolipasemia <br/> - HIV infection <br/> - Autoimmune diseases |

---

## Recommended clinical approach

### Asymptomatic patients

In asymptomatic patients, **no immediate action** is required; evaluate for chronic liver or renal disease, and review medications that can raise lipase. Repeat lipase only if symptoms develop or if there is a change in clinical status.

---

### Symptomatic patients

In symptomatic patients (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), take a focused history and perform an exam to assess for pancreatitis or alternative diagnoses, and order **targeted labs** — amylase, liver enzymes, triglycerides, calcium, and renal function — to evaluate etiology [^867070b7]. Reserve imaging (ultrasound or CT) for persistent or severe symptoms or when the diagnosis remains uncertain [^1edb62d5].

---

## When to repeat lipase testing

Repeat lipase testing is appropriate when **symptoms persist or evolve** to assess for progression, or when the diagnosis remains uncertain and results would change management. Routine serial testing is not recommended once the diagnosis is established or if symptoms resolve [^c90c92b1].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Mild elevation**: Usually benign and often reflects non-pancreatic causes or transient pancreatic irritation.
- **Persistent elevation**: Consider chronic pancreatitis, biliary disease, or macrolipasemia.
- **Management**: Treat the underlying cause; no specific therapy is indicated for an isolated mild lipase elevation.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A lipase of 73 U/L is a **mild, nonspecific finding** that does not diagnose acute pancreatitis. Management should be guided by symptoms and clinical context: reassure if asymptomatic, and if symptomatic, evaluate with history, exam, and targeted labs, reserving imaging for unresolved cases. Avoid routine repeat lipase unless clinically indicated.

Key Points

Question

Does a novel prediction model that uses 8 nonimaging parameters diagnose acute pancreatitis in patients presenting to the emergency department with elevated serum lipase levels?

Findings

In this diagnostic study validating a prediction model, the model demonstrated excellent accuracy. At a score of at least 6 points, prediction model accuracy and performance were optimized, serious alternative diagnoses were uncommon, and diagnostic yield of early imaging was low.

Meaning

This prediction model may accurately diagnose acute pancreatitis and obviate the need for confirmatory diagnostic imaging in many patients.

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

### Assessment of appropriate use of amylase and lipase testing in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis at an academic teaching hospital [^97373f66]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite evidence-based guidelines stating that lipase alone should be used in the diagnosis of suspected acute pancreatitis, health care providers continue to order amylase or amylase and lipase together. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of appropriate laboratory testing related to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Methods

The study used a retrospective cross-sectional design. The timeframe was from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. A retrospective chart review was used to collect data for the following: patient-provider encounter notes, patient demographics, provider demographics, differential and final diagnosis, and laboratory test results. Data analysis include stratification of categorical variables and calculation of cost savings.

Results

For the 12-month period, this study found 2567 (9.3%) of all amylase and lipase tests to be unnecessary. Amylase tests (1881; 73.2%) made up the most unnecessary tests followed by lipase tests (686; 26.7%). An analysis of test-ordering behavior by providers revealed that 81.5% of all unnecessary tests were ordered by MDs. Finally, this study estimated a total cost savings of $128,350 if all unnecessary tests were eliminated.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that amylase and lipase tests have been overutilized in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^4889bbb3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Does hyperlipasemia predict worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19? A multicenter retrospective cohort study [^847d2299]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goal

We aim to perform a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine if elevated serum lipase determines clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Background

Several cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) have recently been reported in association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Most of the evidence is based on elevated serum lipase values without objective demonstration of pancreatic inflammation or necrosis.

Materials and Methods

A population-based, multicenter, retrospective cohort study utilizing TriNetX was performed to obtain aggregated health records of ∼69 million patients from 49 health care organizations from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Adult patients (18y and above) diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified using appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and were stratified into 2 groups, with elevated (≥ 180U/L) and with normal (≤ 80U/L) serum lipase. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; other outcomes were 30-day rehospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressor use, acute kidney injury.

Results

A total of 435,731 adult patients with COVID-19 were identified, and 1406 of them had elevated serum lipase which was associated with higher 30-day mortality [risk ratio (RR) = 1.53, P < 0.001], risk of acute kidney injury (RR = 1.5, P = 0.003), and vasopressor use (RR = 1.69, P < 0.001) without any difference in 30-day rehospitalization (RR = 0.98, P = 0.54), or need for mechanical ventilation (RR = 1.20, P = 0.26). The negative predictive value of normal serum lipase for 3-month mortality in patients with COVID-19 was 91%.

Conclusions

Patients with COVID-19 who have elevated serum lipase experience worse clinical outcomes even in the absence of AP. If these findings can be replicated in prospective studies, serum lipase can be utilized as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Early surgery versus optimal current step-up practice for chronic pancreatitis (ESCAPE): design and rationale of a randomized trial [^6a732f0f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

○ Gabapentine (start: gradual increase over 3 days to a 3 daily dose of 300 mg; maximal dose: 3 daily doses of 1200 mg).

○ Amitryptyline (start: 25 mg per day before sleeping; maximal dose: 100 mg per day before sleeping).

– Dietary advice: patients will be referred for consultation with a dietician for analysis of nutritional status and starting of any necessary dietary program.

– Screening and management of pancreatic insufficiency at baseline:

○ Endocrine insufficiency will be screened by glucose level measurement. If endocrine insufficiency is established, the patient will be referred to a specialized internal medicine physician for management.

○ Exocrine insufficiency will be defined as presence of steatorrhoea, or fecal elastase levels at baseline of < 200 microgram/gram (measured in all patients as part of the study protocol – see 'Outcome measures'). Patients with exocrine insufficiency will be treated with pancreatic enzyme substitution (start: equivalent to 25,000–50,000 FIP-E lipase with main meal, and 10,000–25,000 FIP-E lipase with in-between snacks; maximal dose: 10,000 FIP-E lipase/kg body weight per day).

Failure of medical management (failure of step 1)

If symptoms become intractable to medical management for a prolonged period of time despite adequate adjustment of medication, medical management is considered to have failed. This is defined as one of the following:

– Unsatisfactory pain control: defined as a VAS pain score > 4 in three follow-up moments (patients will be followed once every 2 weeks, see section 'Data collection and follow-up') despite adequate adjustment of medication.

– If achieving satisfactory pain control is associated with clinically unacceptable side-effects, the medication should be discontinued. Such side effects might include sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation or itching.

### Fasting or nonfasting lipid measurements: It depends on the question [^afe303ed]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association Guideline (AHA) on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment thresholds have been replaced with a focus on global risk. In this context, we re-examine the need for fasting lipid measurements in various clinical scenarios including estimating initial risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in a primary prevention patient; screening for familial lipid disorders in a patient with a strong family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or genetic dyslipidemia; clarifying a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome so it can be used to make lifestyle counseling more effective; assessing residual risk in a treated patient; diagnosing and treating patients with suspected hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis; or diagnosing hypertriglyceridemia in patients who require therapy for other conditions that may further elevate triglycerides. Posing a specific question can aid the clinician in understanding when fasting lipids are needed and when nonfasting lipids are adequate.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^c90c92b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic enzymes and imaging — Serum amylase concentrations may be normal in alcohol-induced AP and hypertriglyceridemia, and serum lipase seems to be more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase following disease presentation. For example, an upper limit of normal greater than 3–5 times may be needed in some patients, and while elevations of amylase and lipase greater than 3× normal help establish AP, some patients without AP will have such elevations; once the diagnosis of AP is established, there is no reason to follow the serum amylase or lipase. Abdominal imaging may confirm AP: contrast-enhanced CT provides more than 90% sensitivity and specificity; routine abdominal CT is unwarranted, but in a patient failing to improve after 48–72 hours CT or MRI is recommended to assess local complications, and CT and MRI are comparable in the early assessment of AP.

### Laboratory diagnostic tests in acute pancreatitis [^1680af3c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis depends on a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Although the serum amylase is the cornerstone laboratory test used in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, there are limitations in the sensitivity and specificity that may be important for the clinician to recognize. The serum lipase level may be especially useful in patients with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. A new urinary test strip that uses trypsinogen-2 may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In addition, several new laboratory tests and new interpretations of old laboratory tests may assist in establishing the etiology and severity of acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes important aspects of standard laboratory tests and novel laboratory approaches in establishing the diagnosis, etiology, and severity of acute pancreatitis.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^9f8e2324]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Pancreatitis

ICI therapy may cause elevated levels of lipase or amylase. However, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis as an ICI-related irAE is rare. The clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis requires at least two of three features to be present: elevated lipase to more than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), epigastric pain consistent with pancreatitis, and characteristic radiographic imaging. Because patients with elevated amylase or lipase are often otherwise asymptomatic for pancreatitis, few cases of ICI-related acute pancreatitis have been documented. Additionally, no association has been demonstrated between the degree of lipase elevation and the severity or prognosis of pancreatitis.

In a retrospective analysis of 2,279 patients monitored for lipase elevation, patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1, anti-CTLA-4, or combination ICI therapies exhibited grade ≥ 3 lipase elevation (ie, > 2–5 times ULN with symptoms or > 5 times ULN without symptoms) at rates of 4%, 2%, and 8%, respectively. Of the patients with grade ≥ 3 lipase elevation, 61% exhibited no other symptoms of pancreatitis, while 39% exhibited at least one other typical symptom of acute pancreatitis. The median time from ICI therapy initiation to peak measured lipase elevation was 146 days in patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, 69 days in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and 110 days for patients treated with combination ICI therapy (p = 0.03). In these cases, symptoms typically resolved to grade ≤ 1 within roughly 50 days, regardless of steroid usage. Risk factors for adverse outcomes resulting from acute pancreatitis (eg, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes) included longer duration of ICI therapy, history of smoking, and history of hyperlipidemia. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids during acute pancreatitis was associated with better long-term outcomes, but for patients with grade 3 or 4 acute pancreatitis, the use of corticosteroids does not appear to improve outcomes and management should include consultation with a GI specialist.

GI toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any GI-specific exceptions or additional considerations to the general toxicity management principles are noted in the recommendations below.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis" for acute pancreatitis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for some variability in clinical presentation.

This tool helps determine if the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met. It guides users through selecting relevant clinical features and automatically evaluates these selections.

Here's how the process unfolds:

Diagnosis hinges on three critical indicators:

- Abdominal pain is described as acute, persistent, severe, and primarily in the epigastric region, typically extending to the back.
- Levels of the enzymes lipase or amylase are three times higher than the normal maximum.
- Imaging via CT or MRI shows findings characteristic of pancreatitis.

Using these criteria, the calculator assesses whether the combination of any two of these factors is present:

- If the abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels are reported, or
- If elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings are observed, or
- If abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings are noted.

The diagnostic conclusion is simple:

- If any two out of the three key indicators coincide, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met.
- If fewer than two criteria are present, the criteria are not satisfied.

This straightforward evaluation ensures users can easily understand if the combination of clinical symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Serious Alternative Diagnoses

Particular attention was placed on alternative diagnoses, which may elevate serum lipase levels, mimic AP, and require urgent management. There were 13 cases of bowel obstruction (3.7% of the entire cohort). The median score was 3 (range, −3 to 8 points). Only 1 case (0.3% of the entire cohort) scored at least 6 points (8 points): a woman in her 50s who had a history of recurrent small-bowel obstruction due to adhesions, often in the setting of elevated serum lipase levels. During this particular episode, she presented with similar pain, an initial serum lipase level of 1378 U/L (ULN, 60 U/L), and did not undergo imaging due to the recurrent nature of her symptoms. Her pain resolved quickly, and she was discharged following a 2-day hospitalization.

There were 3 cases of bowel perforation (0.9% of the entire cohort). The scores ranged from 2 to 5 points. All 3 cases underwent early CT imaging to confirm the diagnosis. There were no cases of mesenteric ischemia.

Statistical Analysis

Enrollment of ∼30 evaluable patients with LAL D was planned. All analyses were performed using SAS ® version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Three analysis data sets were used for all data summaries. The full analysis set (FAS) included all of the patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LAL D. The dietary intervention (DI; DIs were considered specialized low-fat or low-cholesterol diets; high-protein or low-sodium diets were not considered DIs for the purposes of this study) set and lipid-lowering medication (LLM) set included patients in the FAS who had ≥ 1 DI or LLM, respectively, with ≥ 1 preintervention and 1 postintervention value for a serum transaminase or serum lipid parameter.

Longitudinal analyses characterized changes over time in laboratory values. Change from baseline (baseline defined as first recorded value) was summarized for serum transaminase and serum lipid parameters.

Summaries included observed values, changes, and percentage changes from baseline and Wilcoxon sign rank analysis–based P values for changes and percentage changes from baseline for each interval. Percentages of patients whose last value in an interval fell above, below, or within normal limits were also provided. Standardized, normal ranges were based on a central lab (if appropriate reference ranges were stratified by age and/or sex). Upper limit of normal values for ALT and AST were selected based on age and sex, set by the central laboratory (based on sex and age) used in a phase 3 study of an investigational enzyme replacement for LAL D (clinicaltrials.gov NCT No. 01757184).

In the substudy, the MN for each patient's liver and spleen was calculated by dividing organ volume (in liters) by expected normal value, defined as 2.5% of the patient's body weight (kilograms) for the liver, and 0.2% of the patient's body weight (kilograms) for the spleen.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^37d5ff08]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The reliance on early imaging in AP may be attributed to limitations of the current diagnostic criteria. For example, how one defines characteristic abdominal pain remains subjective; higher serum lipase level cutoffs are known to have increased PPV; and CT and MRI are subject to differences in sensitivity and interobserver agreement. Notably, these 3 diagnostic criteria are weighted equally, yet few studies have compared their diagnostic performance to each other or as a group.

This novel prediction model improves on several of these limitations. First, it provides an objective framework for what constitutes characteristic abdominal pain, described initially as acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back. The model assigns points for not only epigastric pain but for shorter duration from pain onset to ED presentation (< 5 days) and higher pain scores. Pain radiating to the back was not found to be adequately predictive. Second, it assigns more points for elevations in serum lipase levels beyond at least 3 times the ULN, which are more specific for differentiating AP from nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia. Third, it incorporates perhaps the 2 most significant risk factors for AP: a history of AP or choledocholithiasis.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^18205749]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter study, we prospectively validated a prediction model for the diagnosis of AP among patients presenting to the ED with elevated serum lipase levels. Using nonimaging parameters readily ascertainable at presentation, the model demonstrated excellent discriminatory accuracy (AUROC, 0.91). At a cutoff of at least 6 points, which optimized diagnostic accuracy and performance, the yield of early abdominal CT or MRI was low. This novel model has important implications in the diagnosis of AP.

Acute pancreatitis ranks among the leading contributors to hospitalizations, readmissions, and health care costs among all gastrointestinal tract disorders in the US. Despite improvements in mortality and length of hospital stay, the cost of hospitalization continues to increase, partly due to increasing reliance on imaging studies, particularly at presentation.

The current AP diagnostic criteria, which were first proposed in 2006and agreed on by international consensus in 2012, require 2 of the following 3 features: (1) characteristic abdominal pain, (2) serum lipase (or amylase) level of at least 3 times the ULN, and (3) characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. While multiple AP clinical guidelines, explicitly state that routine early imaging is not necessary because it rarely reveals alternative diagnoses, changes clinical management, or improves outcomes, we found in this study that early imaging was used in 65.0% of participants.

### Cost of unnecessary amylase and lipase testing at multiple academic health systems [^9667340c]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine adherence to Choosing Wisely recommendations for using serum lipase to diagnose acute pancreatitis rather than amylase, avoiding concurrent amylase/lipase testing and avoiding serial measurements after the first elevated test as both are ineffective for tracking disease course.

Methods

Deidentified laboratory data from four large health systems were analyzed to determine concurrent testing rates, serial testing rates, and provider-ordering patterns.

Results

While most providers adhered to recommendations with 58,693 lipase-only tests ordered and performed, 86% of amylase tests were performed concurrently with lipase. Ambulatory, inpatient, and emergency department settings revealed concurrent rates of 51%, 41%, and 8%, respectively. Services with order sets containing both amylase and lipase were associated with higher rates of concurrent testing.

Conclusions

Concurrent amylase/lipase testing is an area of opportunity to improve compliance, especially in ambulatory settings. Revision of order sets and provider education could be interventions to reduce unnecessary testing and save costs.

### A critical evaluation of laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis [^6f25c4bf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

An ideal laboratory test in the evaluation of a patient with acute pancreatitis (AP) should, in addition to accurately establishing the diagnosis of AP, provide early assessment of its severity and identify the etiology. None of the tests available today meet all these criteria, and presently there is no biochemical test that can be considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of AP. In the diagnosis of AP, serum amylase and lipase remain important tests. Advantages of amylase estimation are its technical simplicity, easy availability, and high sensitivity. However, its greatest disadvantage is its low specificity. A normal amylase would usually exclude the diagnosis of AP, with the exception of AP secondary to hyperlipidemia, acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis, and when the estimation of amylase is delayed in the course of the disease. The major advantage of lipase is an increased sensitivity in acute alcoholic pancreatitis and in patients who initially present to the emergency room days after the onset of the disease, as lipase remains elevated longer than amylase. Although once considered to be specific for AP, nonspecific elevations of lipase have been reported in almost as many disorders as amylase, thus decreasing its specificity. Simultaneous estimation of amylase and lipase does not improve the accuracy. Other enzymes for the diagnosis of AP — pancreatic isoamylase, immunoreactive trypsin, and elastase — are more cumbersome and expensive and have no clear role in the diagnosis of AP. No enzyme assay has a predictive role in determining the severity or etiology of AP. Once the diagnosis of AP is established, daily measurements of enzymes have no value in assessing the clinical progress of the patient or ultimate prognosis and should be discouraged. A host of new serological and urinary markers have been investigated in the last few years. Their main use is in predicting the severity of AP. At present, serum C-reactive protein at 48 h is the best available laboratory marker of severity. Urinary trypsinogen activation peptides within 12–24 h of onset of AP are able to predict the severity but are not widely available. Serum interleukins 6 and 8 seem promising but remain experimental.

### Acute pancreatitis in chronic dialysis patients [^06cad770]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

The annual incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) ranges from 4.9 to 73.4 cases per 100,000 worldwide. Patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis have an increased risk for developing AP compared with patients without renal disease. In addition to the general population risk factors, there are factors related to renal insufficiency and dialysis process that might predispose to AP in this population. Clinical features and diagnosis are the same as those in patients without renal failure; however, amylase and lipase levels should be interpreted cautiously as they might be falsely elevated in renal failure. In this article, we will describe the risk factors that are exclusive to this population. In addition, we will also focus on the laboratory indices and clinical features that are unique to this population with patients with end-stage renal disease.

Patients "should be counseled that if they discontinue or pause treatment for a length of time, they may need to restart at a low dose and titrate up", GLP-1 RAs "also cause a modest increase in heart rate", and those with vomiting or diarrhea should be monitored "for dehydration and renal impairment". Therapy "is also associated with elevations in lipase and amylase in the absence of pancreatitis", and "The FDA still recommends close monitoring for mood changes, emerging or worsening depression, or suicidal behavior during treatment with GLP-1 RA".

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^3066bf11]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) currently requires fulfilling at least 2 of 3 criteria: (1) characteristic abdominal pain, (2) serum lipase (or amylase) levels elevated to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal (or reference range) (ULN), and (3) characteristic findings on imaging, typically abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While 90% of patients fulfill symptom and laboratory criteria at presentation and therefore do not require imaging confirmation, early imaging remains overused.

To address this limitation, a prediction model and corresponding point-based score were previously developed to diagnose AP in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected AP, defined as serum lipase levels of at least 3 times the ULN. This model used 8 nonimaging parameters found to be most associated with AP, each readily ascertainable at presentation: 1 laboratory variable (initial serum lipase level), 3 variables pertaining to medical history (number of prior AP episodes, prior cholelithiasis, or recent abdominal surgery), and 4 variables characterizing abdominal pain (pain localized to the epigastrium, pain of worsening severity, duration from pain onset to presentation, and pain level at ED presentation).

While the model demonstrated excellent discriminatory accuracy for AP in a retrospective cohort, it has not been prospectively validated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the prediction model to diagnose AP when applied to a prospective cohort of patients.

Use, Timing, and Yield of Early Diagnostic Imaging

Abdominal CT or MRI was performed early (within 24 hours of presentation) in 227 participants (65.0%), and at any point during the hospitalization in 251 (71.9%); 98 (28.1%) received no imaging. Early imaging was performed more often in those predicted to have AP (116 of 155 [74.8%] when the score was ≥ 6 vs 111 of 194 [57.2%] when the score was < 6; P < .001). Among those undergoing early imaging, the median time from return of serum lipase results to imaging performed was 86 (IQR, 35–175) minutes. Early imaging was performed before lipase results were returned in 27 participants (11.9%). Among participants with a score of at least 6 points, early imaging was performed in 116 (representing 51.1% of early imaging). Of these 116 early imaging studies, 8 (6.9%) revealed an alternative diagnosis (3 cases of enteritis or colitis, 3 cases of cholangitis or choledocholithiasis, 1 case of diverticulitis, and 1 case of a duodenal hematoma). Among patients with a score of at least 7 points, early imaging was performed in 93 (representing 41.0% of early imaging). Of these 93 early imaging studies, 1 MRI (1.1%) revealed choledocholithiasis without AP. Among participants with a score of at least 8 points, early imaging was performed in 73 (representing 32.2% of early imaging). Of these 73 early imaging studies, 1 MRI (1.4%) revealed an alternative diagnosis (the aforementioned choledocholithiasis without AP). The remaining 72 studies (98.6%) revealed AP or were nondiagnostic.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^0cd5eb91]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Serum pancreatic enzyme measurement is the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of AP. In an episode of AP, amylase, lipase, elastase, and trypsin are released into the bloodstream at the same time but the clearance varies depending on the timing of blood sampling. Amylase is an enzyme secreted by the pancreas, and also salivary glands, small intestine, ovaries, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles. There are two major isoforms of amylase: pancreatic and salivary, and the leading function is digestion of starch, glycogen, and related poly- and oligosaccharides, by hydrolysis. In AP, serum amylase levels usually rise within 6 to 24 h, peak at 48 h, and decrease to normal or near normal levels over the next 3 to 7 days.

Lipase is another enzyme secreted by the pancreas. AP is the main reason for an increase in lipase, and many investigators emphasize that lipase is more specific, but can be found elevated also in non-pancreatic diseases such as renal disease, appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, etc. In AP, serum lipase remains elevated for a longer period than serum amylase. It rises within 4 to 8 h, peaks at 24 h, and decreases to normal or near normal levels over the next 8 to 14 days.

Trypsinogen is the zymogen of the pancreatic enzyme trypsin. In AP, the serum and urinary concentrations of trypsinogen usually rise to high levels within a few hours and decrease in 3 days.

Collectively, serum lipase is considered a more reliable diagnostic marker of AP than serum amylase. No single test shows optimal diagnostic accuracy, but most current guidelines and recommendations indicate that lipase should be preferred over total and p-amylase. The main reasons supporting lipase over both types of amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis include higher sensitivity and larger diagnostic window. A Cochrane revision with the aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of different pancreatic enzymes in the diagnosis of AP showed a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 93% for serum amylase, and 79% and 89% for serum lipase, respectively.

Chang et al. found in a meta-analysis including 13 studies that trypsinogen-2 dipstick test is a rapid and non-invasive bedside test with sensitivity 82% and specificity 94% for AP.

For the ≥ 885 mg/dL branch, the stated goal is "pancreatitis prophylaxis" with "low fat diet, fibrate and/or omega-3 FA", then "Reassess in 8–12 weeks"; if "Persistent TG ≥ 885 mg/dL or ≥ 10 mmol/L", the algorithm lists "DNA testing for FCS" and "Lipidologist referral". For the 150–884 mg/dL branch, clinicians should "Evaluate: global cardiovascular risk"; if "High/intermediate", "Start statin; monitor LDL-C or non-HDL-C or Apo B", whereas if "Low", "Focus on lifestyle behavior changes". After treatment, "Reassess in 8–12 weeks" and check "LDL-C target attained?"; if "Yes: consider icosapent ethyl for TG 150–500 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L)", and if "No: follow LDL-C algorithm". Across all HTG patients, the figure lists "Clinical assessment and fasting lipids", "Address 2° causes", and "Lifestyle intervention: diet, weight loss" to "Optimize cardiovascular risk factors".

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^8ab34b60]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — diagnostic criteria and etiologies specify that diagnosis of AP requires at least 2 features, including characteristic abdominal pain; biochemical evidence with amylase or lipase elevated > 3 times the upper limit of normal; and/or radiographic evidence on cross-sectional imaging. The most common causes remain gallstones and alcohol, which together comprise 80% of cases, and most cases of AP (around 80%) are mild with only interstitial changes without local or systemic complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis and is typically seen in patients with moderately severe or severe AP.

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^6977da0d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymaemia is not specific for acute pancreatitis, occurring in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. Where persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs in the absence of a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before a diagnosis of benign pancreatic hyperenzymaemia can be made. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^a7c0eda3]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pancreatitis diagnosis requires at least two of three features: elevated lipase to more than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), epigastric pain consistent with pancreatitis, and characteristic radiographic imaging. In a retrospective analysis of 2,279 patients, grade ≥ 2 lipase elevation occurred at rates of 4%, 2%, and 8% with anti-PD-(L)1, anti-CTLA-4, and combination ICI therapy, respectively; among those with grade ≥ 3 lipase elevation, 61% had no other symptoms while 39% had at least one typical symptom. Median time to peak lipase elevation from therapy initiation was 146 days (anti-PD-(L)1), 69 days (anti-CTLA-4), and 110 days (combination) (p = 0.03), and symptoms typically resolved with lipase falling within roughly 50 days regardless of steroid usage. During acute pancreatitis, intravenous fluids were associated with better long-term outcomes, whereas for grade 3 or 4 acute pancreatitis corticosteroids do not appear to impact outcomes and steroid management should be assessed case by case if pleural effusions are suspected.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^1edb62d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^a3575549]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

While most patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) fulfill diagnostic criteria with characteristic abdominal pain and serum lipase levels of at least 3times the upper limit of normal (reference range) at presentation, early imaging is often used for confirmation. A prior prediction model and corresponding point-based score were developed using nonimaging parameters to diagnose AP in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Objective

To evaluate the performance of the prediction model to diagnose AP in a prospective patient cohort.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective diagnostic study included consecutive adult patients presenting to the ED between January 1, 2020, and March 9, 2021, at 2 large academic medical centers in the northeastern US with serum lipase levels at least 3times the upper limit of normal. Patients transferred from outside institutions or with malignant disease and established intra-abdominal metastases, acute trauma, or altered mentation were excluded. Data were analyzed from October 15 to October 23, 2023.

Exposures

Participants were assigned scores for initial serum lipase level, number of prior AP episodes, prior cholelithiasis, abdominal surgery within 2 months, presence of epigastric pain, pain of worsening severity, duration from pain onset to presentation, and pain level at ED presentation.

Main Outcome and Measures

A final diagnosis of AP, established by expert review of hospitalization records.

Results

Prospective scores in 349 participants (mean [SD] age, 53.0[18.8] years; 184 women [52.7%]; 66 Black [18.9%]; 199 White [57.0%]) demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91. A score of at least 6 points achieved highest accuracy (F score, 82.0), corresponding to a sensitivity of 81.5%, specificity of 85.9%, positive predictive value of 82.6%, and negative predictive value of 85.1% for AP diagnosis. Early computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed more often in participants predicted to have AP (116 of 155 [74.8%] with a score ≥ 6 vs 111 of 194 [57.2%] with a score < 6; P < .001). Early imaging revealed an alternative diagnosis in 8 of 116 participants (6.9%) with scores of at least 6 points, 1 of 93 (1.1%) with scores of at least 7 points, and 1 of 73 (1.4%) with scores of at least 8 points.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicenter diagnostic study, the prediction model demonstrated excellent AP diagnostic accuracy. Its application may be used to avoid unnecessary confirmatory imaging.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis and initial evaluation — requires meeting INSPPIRE-based criteria with at least two features, including abdominal pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging findings, and initial imaging should be transabdominal ultrasonography with additional imaging reserved for complicated cases; first-attack testing should include liver enzymes, triglyceride, and calcium levels. Specifically, diagnosis "requires at least 2 of the following: (1) abdominal pain compatible with AP, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, (3) imaging findings consistent with AP", and "Initial imaging may be accomplished via transabdominal ultrasonography, with other imaging (CT, MRI) reserved for more complicated cases ± tailored to suspected etiology", while "first attack of AP testing should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin), triglyceride level, and calcium level".

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^eeb0d2b1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in hypertriglyceridemia — required features and caveats: The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following — acute onset of persistent, severe upper abdominal pain often radiating to the back, serum lipase levels elevated to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In the presence of chylomicronemia, pancreatitis etiology is reasonably ascribed to severe hypertriglyceridemia, and serum pancreatic lipase may not be consistently elevated during acute or recurrent episodes related to hypertriglyceridemia. Patients with FCS may worry about cumulative radiation risk from repeated CT imaging, so the diagnostic necessity should be carefully considered with cumulative risk, and TG levels may have already begun to self-correct by the time of initial emergency assessment.

### Effect of best practice advisories on sedation protocol compliance and drug-related hazardous condition mitigation among critical care patients [^a82aa453]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether best practice advisories improved sedation protocol compliance and could mitigate potential propofol-related hazardous conditions.

Design

Retrospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Two adult ICUs at two academic medical centers that share the same sedation protocol.

Patients

Adults 18 years old or older admitted to the ICU between January 1, 2016, and January 31, 2018, who received a continuous infusion of propofol.

Interventions

Two concurrent best practice advisories built in the electronic health record as a clinical decision support tool to enforce protocol compliance with triglyceride and lipase level monitoring and mitigate propofol-related hazardous conditions.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcomes were baseline and day 3 compliance with triglyceride and lipase laboratory monitoring per protocol and time to discontinuation of propofol in the setting of triglyceride and/or lipase levels exceeding protocol cutoffs. A total of 1,394 patients were included in the study cohort (n = 700 in the pre-best practice advisory group; n = 694 in the post-best practice advisory group). In inverse probability weighted regression analyses, implementing the best practice advisory was associated with a 56.6% (95% CI, 52.6–60.9) absolute increase and a 173% relative increase (risk ratio, 2.73; 95% CI, 2.45–3.04) in baseline laboratory monitoring. The best practice advisory was associated with a 34.0% (95% CI, 20.9–47.1) absolute increase and a 74% (95% CI, 1.39–2.19) relative increase in day 3 laboratory monitoring after inverse probability weighted analyses. Among patients with laboratory values exceeding protocol cutoffs, implementation of the best practice advisory resulted in providers discontinuing propofol an average of 16.6 hours (95% CI, 4.8–28.3) sooner than pre-best practice advisory. Findings from alternate analyses using interrupted time series were consistent with the inverse probability weighted analyses.

Conclusions

Best practice advisories can be effectively used in ICUs to improve sedation protocol compliance and may mitigate potential propofol-related hazardous conditions. Best practice advisories should undergo continuous quality assurance and optimizations to maximize clinical utility and minimize alert fatigue.

### Acute pancreatitis: rapid evidence review [^4abb455c]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is the most common gastrointestinal-related reason for hospitalization in the United States. It is diagnosed based on the revised Atlanta classification, with the presence of at least two of three criteria (upper abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase level greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic findings on imaging studies). Although computed tomography and other imaging studies can be useful to assess severity or if the diagnosis is uncertain, imaging is not required to diagnose acute pancreatitis. Based on limited studies, several scoring systems have comparable effectiveness for predicting disease severity. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on day 1 of hospital admission is highly sensitive in predicting severe disease. Treatment of acute pancreatitis involves goal-directed fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and oral feedings as tolerated on admission. If oral feedings are not tolerated, nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings are preferred over parenteral nutrition. Cholecystectomy is recommended during the initial admission for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. Medical management is usually sufficient for necrotizing pancreatitis; however, if surgical intervention is needed, a minimally invasive approach is advised over direct endoscopic or open surgical debridement (necrosectomy) because of lower complication rates.

### Protocol for a randomized trial of the effect of timing of cholecystectomy during initial admission for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis at a safety-net hospital [^c784ee4a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Study population

Patients are considered to have gallstone pancreatitis if they have: (1) upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric tenderness, (2) the absence of ethanol abuse, (3) elevated plasma lipase level above the upper limit of normal (≥ 370 U/L), and (4) imaging confirming gallstones or sludge. This definition is consistent with guidelines recommending the combination of clinical features with elevation of plasma concentrations of pancreatic enzymes (lipase over amylase) for diagnosis. Only patients with predicted mild pancreatitis based on the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score (0–2 points, < 2% mortality) are screened for enrollment. Inclusion criteria include: patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy prior to discharge, age ≥ 18 years, lack of any very strong indicator for choledocholithiasis based on the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines (table 2), and clinical stability as denoted by admission to a non-monitored floor bed. Exclusion criteria include: pregnancy, severe preexisting medical comorbidities precluding surgery, organ failure, local or systemic complications of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, native language other than English and Spanish, and refusal to participate.

Table 2
American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines

Using these criteria, patients were enrolled and randomized from June 27, 2016 to May 18, 2017. Subsequently, due to concerns regarding the accuracy of BISAP to predict mild acute gallstone pancreatitis, the criteria were changed to prevent potentially operating on a patient who had progression of their pancreatitis. Starting on August 16, 2017, patients were enrolled but not randomized until there was no evidence of clinical deterioration after at least 12 hours after enrollment. Clinical deterioration is defined by new onset tachycardia, hypotension requiring fluids or vasopressors, decreased urine output, indication for further imaging to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis, transfer to the ICU, or clinical judgement of the treating physician.

Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding

Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines are being followed. Patients are randomized using variable permuted blocks using a computer-generated random sequence. Patients are randomized by a research coordinator not involved in the study using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Patients are stratified based on the ASGE risk for choledocholithiasis (intermediate vs high likelihood, table 2). Data analysts, but not patients and healthcare providers, are blinded. A blinded outcome adjudication committee will review the outcomes.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^457d2cb8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Notably, the model has the potential to obviate the need for confirmatory imaging in many patients who present with hyperlipasemia. Serum lipase measurement is often used in the ED as part of a broad evaluation for nonspecific abdominal pain. Though commonly associated with AP, hyperlipasemia can develop in a variety of pancreatic and nonpancreatic disorders. While many of these, such as cholangitis, decompensated cirrhosis, and kidney failure, can be readily distinguished with history taking and laboratory testing, a few, in particular, may lead to rapid clinical deterioration if not diagnosed promptly: bowel obstruction, bowel ischemia, and visceral perforation. We have prospectively demonstrated that the prediction model is helpful in ruling out these serious alternative diagnoses, which had a prevalence of 4.6% (13 bowel obstruction and 3 bowel perforation diagnoses) in our study population. Using a diagnostic cutoff of at least 6 points, only 1 participant (0.3% of the entire cohort) with a serious alternative diagnosis (small bowel obstruction) would have been misdiagnosed as having AP. The yield of early imaging was similarly low. In the same cohort of participants predicted to have AP (≥ 6 points), alternative diagnoses were discovered in only 6.9% of early imaging examinations, none of which were immediately life-threatening. At a more conservative diagnostic cutoff of at least 8 points (PPV, 92.7%), only 1.4% of early imaging studies (1 participant with choledocholithiasis) revealed an alternative diagnosis. This highlights the model's adaptability when operationalized: applying a diagnostic cutoff of at least 6 points for patients with mild symptoms and without organ dysfunction would conceptually have reduced early imaging by 51%. Applying a cutoff of at least 8 points for patients with more severe symptoms and/or signs could further curtail serious misdiagnoses by exploiting a high PPV but still conceptually have reduced early imaging by 32%. Immediate early imaging would continue to be appropriate when there is concern regarding a life-threatening alternative diagnosis.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^a53c8def]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — hypertriglyceridemia thresholds and follow-up are outlined as follows: Serum TG should rise above 1,000 mg/dL to be considered the cause of AP. The risk of AP increased by 4% for every 100 mg/dL of TG above the normal limit, even higher when TG levels are above 500 mg/dL. A lactescent serum has been observed in as many as 20% of patients with AP; therefore, a fasting TG level should be re-evaluated 1 month after discharge when hypertriglyceridemia is suspected.

### Sequential intensification of metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes with liraglutide followed by randomized addition of basal insulin prompted by A1c targets [^27deac36]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

It remains unknown whether an association exists between incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis, but acute pancreatitis is known to be about three times more common in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population. In the present trial, two cases of pancreatitis were reported (one acute and one chronic) and neither case of pancreatitis was preceded by elevated lipase levels. Reports of pancreatitis were similarly uncommon in other liraglutide studies, although imbalances in pancreatitis are noted for liraglutide and other incretin-based therapies. An initial small increase in median serum lipase below the upper limit of normal was observed across groups in the current study, and substantial fluctuations occurred over time. Interpreting these changes is difficult in the absence of an active comparator or a placebo group (i.e. a group not receiving liraglutide). Elevated lipase (or amylase) levels by themselves are insufficient to make a diagnosis of pancreatitis without the presence of abdominal pain and ideally confirmation with imaging studies. Most commonly, no gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with fluctuations in lipase observed during this trial.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: expert review [^94e0d684]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Best practice advice 9 — breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests: Best Practice Advice 9: Breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests hold promise, but are not widely available in the United States. Breath tests were developed to measure intestinal digestion of mixed triglycerides in which the carbons are radiolabeled with 13C or 14C; these isotope-labeled triglycerides are digested by pancreatic lipase and co-lipase and the 13CO2 or 14CO2 are released, exhaled, and measured in expired breath, with digestion in humans requiring a collection of breath over many hours. This technique is more widely used in Europe. An alternative approach developed in the United States is to deliver an oral substrate that is digested and used to measure the products of digestion in the blood, and the ratio of the 2 fatty acids in the blood provides a measure of pancreatic enzyme–specific digestion; similar to the breath test, the blood test takes many hours. Both tests measure digestive activity rather than enzyme quantity, and these can be repeated on PERT therapy to measure efficacy.

### LEADER 3 – lipase and amylase activity in subjects with type 2 diabetes: baseline data from over 9000 subjects in the LEADER trial [^a07762e1]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This report from the LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) trial describes baseline lipase and amylase activity in type 2 diabetic subjects without acute pancreatitis symptoms before randomization to the glucagonlike peptide analog liraglutide or placebo.

Methods

The LEADER is an international randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide in 9340 type 2 diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk. Fasting lipase and amylase activity was assessed at baseline, before receiving liraglutide or placebo, using a commercial assay (Roche) with upper limit of normal values of 63 U/L for lipase and 100 U/L for amylase.

Results

Either or both enzymes were above the upper limit of normal in 22.7% of subjects; 16.6% (n = 1540) had an elevated lipase level (including 1.2% > 3-fold elevated), and 11.8% (n = 1094) had an elevated amylase level (including 0.2% > 3-fold elevated). In multivariable regression models, severely reduced kidney function was associated with the largest effect on increasing activity of both. However, even among subjects with normal kidney function, 12.2% and 7.7% had elevated lipase and amylase levels.

Conclusions

In this large study of type 2 diabetic patients, nearly 25% had elevated lipase or amylase levels without symptoms of acute pancreatitis. The clinician must take these data into account when evaluating abdominal symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Origin, presentation, and clinical course of nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia [^2f59e0c8]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as a constellation of abnormal pancreatic enzymes, imaging, and characteristic pain. The origin and clinical significance of isolated hyperlipasemia is unclear.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated patients with serum lipase level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) admitted to Los Angeles County Hospital from October 2014 to April 2015. Patients were identified by a daily laboratory query used to support an ongoing randomized trial of goal-directed therapy for AP (NCT 01761539). Nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia (NPHL) was defined as a serum lipase level greater than 3 times the ULN without characteristic pain or imaging.

Results

Among 221 patients with lipase level greater than 3 times the ULN, 170 met criterion for AP, and 51 did not. The leading etiologies for NPHL were decompensated cirrhosis and renal failure. Patients with NPHL were significantly older and had more comorbidities and lower serum lipase levels (360 ± 36 vs 1453 ± 135 IU/L, P < 0.001). There were no differences in length of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or mortality.

Conclusions

Elevated serum lipase level has many nonpancreatic origins, with liver and renal failure being the most frequent. Distinct clinical features can help to differentiate between AP and NPHL.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^60d36335]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective diagnostic study followed the 2015 Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis guidelines. This study was conducted at 2 large academic medical centers in the northeastern US, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Boston, Massachusetts, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, and was approved by the institutional review board of each hospital with waiver of the requirement for informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. The data-gathering period was from January 1, 2020, to March 9, 2021. Daily consecutive cases of hyperlipasemia, defined as serum lipase levels of at least 3 times the ULN (≥ 180 U/L), were identified using an ED laboratory query and were eligible for inclusion. Patients transferred from outside hospitals, with malignant disease and known intra-abdominal metastases, with acute traumatic injury, or with altered mentation precluding accurate history taking were excluded when deriving the original modeland similarly excluded from this validation study.

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was a diagnosis of AP according to the current reference standard, determined by an experienced medical pancreatologist (D.X.J.) after a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) review of the ED course and, when applicable, hospitalization and postdischarge course. This investigator was blinded to the final score of each participant. Because all included participants presented with serum lipase levels of at least 3 times the ULN, AP was diagnosed if (1) CT or MRI revealed findings characteristic of AP at any time during the hospitalization or 3-month postdischarge period, or (2) presenting symptoms were characteristic of AP and not clearly explained by another condition. Alternative diagnoses were recorded, when applicable, by the same investigator.

### Serum lipase as an early predictor of severity in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^b10494b4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pediatric pancreatitis remains poorly understood despite increasing incidence and risk of morbidity and mortality. Present predictive scores for severe pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) are either extrapolated from adults or difficult to use in practice. We aimed to identify laboratory parameters for early prediction of severity of the course of pediatric AP.

Methods

A retrospective review of children with AP (January 2000-July 2011) was performed at 2 pediatric hospitals. Predictors of severe AP using laboratory parameters measured within 24 hours of presentation were derived in the cohort from one institution and validated in the other.

Results

A total of 131 pancreatitis episodes, 73 (34% severe) and 58 (24% severe) in the derivation and validation cohorts respectively, were reviewed. In the derivation cohort, serum lipase was significantly higher in severe versus mild AP (median [interquartile range] 18.1 [9.2–39.1] vs 4.9 (3.2–13.3) × upper limit of normal [ULN]; P = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis in the derivation cohort showed serum lipase ≥ 7 × ULN to be predictive of severe AP. This finding was confirmed in the validation cohort. Based on the combined derivation and validation data, serum lipase ≥ 7 × ULN was associated with an odds ratio of 7.1 (95% confidence interval 2.5–20.5; P < 0.001) for developing severe AP. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 85%, 56%, 46%, 89%, 1.939, and 0.27, respectively.

Conclusions

Serum lipase ≥ 7 × ULN within 24 hours of presentation may be a simple clinical predictor of severe AP in children. Lipase levels below this threshold are strongly associated with a milder course.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^b41b7089]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child physical abuse — laboratory screening key points emphasize that laboratory studies are an important part of the forensic evaluation for injuries in all patients with suspected PCA, and child physical abuse can occur in the presence of an underlying medical disorder; the mere presence of hemophilia or metabolic bone disease does not exclude the diagnosis of child physical abuse. Obtain serum transaminases (AST/ ALT), lipase, hematocrit, and urinalysis in all children undergoing forensic evaluation for child physical abuse. Evaluate serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D levels in cases of unexplained fracture. Obtain specific recommended coagulation studies in all children with "spontaneous" or unexplained hemorrhage, including bruising and intracranial hemorrhage without fracture. Specific laboratory screening is designed to minimize the use of high-dose ionizing radiation from routine CT in all patients while avoiding missed injuries.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated gastrointestinal effects — pancreatitis present with emesis, abdominal pain, and elevated amylase and lipase levels. Risk factors include hypertriglyceridemia, advanced HIV infection, a previous episode of pancreatitis, and alcohol use. If pancreatitis is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, consider using interventions to lower TG (triglyceride) levels.

### Utility of amylase and lipase as predictors of grade of injury or outcomes in pediatric patients with pancreatic trauma [^0c7e293a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Grade of injury, serum amylase, and lipase are markers used to assess pancreatic injury. It is unclear how amylase and lipase relate to grade of injury or predict outcome. We hypothesize that serum amylase and lipase are good predictors of grade of injury and outcomes in patients with pancreatic trauma.

Methods

This study is a multicenter review from 9 pediatric trauma centers of all children admitted to their institution over 5 years with a pancreatic injury. Initial as well as peak amylase and lipase values were analyzed with relation to pancreatic grade, length of stay, and outcomes.

Results

One hundred thirty-one records were analyzed. There were 44 girls and 85 boys with an average age of 9.0 ± 0.4 years. The mean injury severity score (ISS) score was 15.5 ± 1.2 SE. The average length of stay (in days) was analyzed by grades 0 (3.93), 1 (7.73), 2 (13.4), 3 (18.4), 4 (31), and 5 (13.5). Neither initial nor peak amylase/lipase correlated with grade of injury. Neither amylase nor lipase predicted length of stay or mortality. Maximal amylase was highly predictive of developing a pseudocyst.

Conclusion

There seems to be limited value for repetitive routine amylase and lipase levels in the management of pediatric trauma patients with pancreatic injury.

### Reducing phlebotomy, length of stay, cost: development of a blunt abdominal trauma pathway in a level I, pediatric trauma center [^01fab875]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with higher hemodynamic stabilities when compared with adults. Pediatric patients with BAT can often be managed without surgical interventions; however, laboratory testing is often recommended. Yet, laboratory testing can be costly, and current literature has not identified appropriate pathways or specific tests necessary to detect intra-abdominal injury after BAT. Therefore, the present study evaluated a proposed laboratory testing pathway to determine if it safely reduced draws of complete blood counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panels, amylase and lipase levels orders, emergency department (ED) length of stay, and cost in pediatric BAT patients.

Methods

A retrospective review of levels I, II, and III BAT pediatric patients (n = 329) was performed from 2015 to 2018 at our level I, pediatric trauma center. Patients were then grouped based on pre-post pathway, and differences were calculated using univariate analyses.

Results

After implementation of the pathway, there was a significant decrease in the number of complete blood counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panels, amylase, and lipase levels orders (P < 0.05). Postpathway patients had lower average ED lengths of stay and testing costs compared with the pre pathway patients (P < 0.05). There was no increase in rates of return to the ED within 30 days, missed injuries, or readmissions of patients to the ED.

Conclusions

Results displayed that the adoption of a laboratory testing pathway for BAT patients reduced the number of laboratory tests, ED length of stay, and associated costs pediatric patients without impacting quality care.

### A case of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency confirmed by response to sebelipase alfa therapy [^bcf41d49]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency, or cholesterol ester storage disease, is a disorder affecting the breakdown of cholesterol esters and triglycerides within lysosomes. Clinical findings include hepatomegaly, hepatic dysfunction, and dyslipidemia with a wide range of phenotypic variability and age of onset. The available clinical and molecular information of the patient presented herein was consistent with a diagnosis of LAL deficiency, but her LAL activity assay repeatedly showed normal or borderline low results. Her response to enzyme replacement therapy and demonstrable deficiency on a newer specific enzymatic assay ultimately confirmed her diagnosis of LAL deficiency.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^f2cd6f9c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Triglycerides — treatment targets and pancreatitis risk are outlined as follows: The NLA Expert Panel agreed that an elevated triglyceride level is not a target of therapy per se, except when very high (≥ 500 mg/dL). When triglycerides are between 200 and 499 mg/dL, the targets of therapy are non–HDL-C and LDL-C. Fasting triglyceride levels of ≥ 500 mg/dL (and especially ≥ 1000 mg/dL) are associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis, and a threshold of ≥ 500 mg/dL was selected to define very high triglycerides. In > 65,000 subjects followed for 15 years, the risk of acute pancreatitis increased 4% for each 100 mg/dL increase in triglyceride level. Thus, when the triglyceride concentration is very high (≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially if ≥ 1000 mg/dL), reducing the concentration to < 500 mg/dL to prevent pancreatitis becomes the primary goal of therapy, although there are limited clinical trial data supporting benefits for reducing pancreatitis risk.

### Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^f1f47d7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. There is currently no Cochrane review of the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Objectives

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We excluded case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias. We accepted any of the following reference standards: biopsy, consensus conference definition, radiological features of acute pancreatitis, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, and organ failure. At least two review authors independently searched and screened the references located by the search to identify relevant studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. The thresholds used for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis varied in the trials, resulting in sparse data for each index test. Because of sparse data, we used -2 log likelihood values to determine which model to use for meta-analysis. We calculated and reported the sensitivity, specificity, post-test probability of a positive and negative index test along with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each cutoff, but have reported only the results of the recommended cutoff of three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 50 mg/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 in the abstract.

Main Results

Ten studies including 5056 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in people presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The risk of bias was unclear or high for all of the included studies. The study that contributed approximately two-thirds of the participants included in this review was excluded from the results of the analysis presented below due to major concerns about the participants included in the study. We have presented only the results where at least two studies were included in the analysis. Serum amylase, serum lipase, and urinary trypsinogen-2 at the standard threshold levels of more than three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and a threshold of 50 ng/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 appear to have similar sensitivities (0.72 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82); 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.92); and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84), respectively) and specificities (0.93 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.99); 0.89 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.99); and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93), respectively). At the median prevalence of 22.6% of acute pancreatitis in the studies, out of 100 people with positive test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 74 (95% CI 33 to 94); 68 (95% CI 21 to 94); and 67 (95% CI 57 to 76) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively; out of 100 people with negative test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 8 (95% CI 5 to 12); 7 (95% CI 3 to 15); and 8 (95% CI 5 to 13) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively. We were not able to compare these tests formally because of sparse data.

Authors' Conclusions

As about a quarter of people with acute pancreatitis fail to be diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with the evaluated tests, one should have a low threshold to admit the patient and treat them for acute pancreatitis if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, even if these tests are normal. About 1 in 10 patients without acute pancreatitis may be wrongly diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests, therefore it is important to consider other conditions that require urgent surgical intervention, such as perforated viscus, even if these tests are abnormal. The diagnostic performance of these tests decreases even further with the progression of time, and one should have an even lower threshold to perform additional investigations if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis.

DIAGNOSIS OF AND DETERMINATION OF THE ETIOLOGY AP

The diagnosis of AP in this patient is straightforward. He is presenting with characteristic abdominal pain with a markedly elevated lipase. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not needed in this patient. It will not assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially as most patients (80%) will improve. CT should be reserved for the patient who presents with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of the amylase/lipase which could be nonspecific.

The etiology of the AP in this patient is not clear. Identifying the etiology is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol are the most common causes of AP. Although the US is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, the negative examination does not rule out biliary etiology. A stone in the gallbladder may have passed to the common bile duct and be missed by the US whether it has or has not passed to the duodenum. Although initial US may be negative, given prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the examination should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found. Alcohol is a common cause of AP but requires a relatively large amount of alcohol (50 g) consumption over multiple years to cause pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? Not likely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor causing AP, an outpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be performed if no etiology is identified. It is common that no etiology is identified. Such patients are correctly identified as having idiopathic AP whose further management is complex and controversial.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity testing in FCS is primarily a research tool: postheparin LPL activity assays have been used to identify patients with FCS and require blood samples before and after intravenous heparin injection to release LPL from the endothelium. Individuals with FCS typically have < 20% of normal LPL activity, but LPL activity testing is not commercially available and is highly variable and often nonreproducible even in research laboratories.

### Interpretation of serum pancreatic enzymes in pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions [^881aac47]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum levels of amylase and lipase can be elevated in nonpancreatic conditions that may or may not be associated with abdominal pain. This leads to a large proportion of patients being falsely labeled as having acute pancreatitis. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing evidence on pancreatic enzyme elevation in various pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions and its practical implications in clinical practice and healthcare.

Recent Findings

Serum amylase and lipase levels are not specific for pancreatitis. Attempts have been made to validate newer biomarkers including pancreatic elastase, serum trypsin, urinary trypsinogen-activated peptide, phospholipase A2, carboxypeptidase B, activated peptide of carboxypeptidase B, the trypsin 2 alpha 1 activation complex, and circulating cell-free DNA for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Summary

Serum lipase levels can be elevated in many intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions. Although more sensitive and specific than amylase, serum lipase levels are not sufficient to diagnose acute pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain. There is a need to increase stress on radiological evidence as well increase cut-off levels of enzyme elevation for a more accurate diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

### A clinical model for the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in the emergency department [^cb66cd8d]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to develop a diagnostic model that predicts acute pancreatitis (AP) risk before imaging.

Methods

Emergency department patients with serum lipase elevated to 3 times the upper limit of normal or greater were identified retrospectively (September 1, 2013-August 31, 2015). An AP diagnosis was established by expert review of full hospitalization records. Candidate predictors included demographic and clinical characteristics at presentation. Using a derivation set, a multivariable logistic regression model and corresponding point-based scoring system was developed to predict AP. Discrimination accuracy and calibration were assessed in a separate validation set.

Results

In 319 eligible patients, 182 (57%) had AP. The final model (area under curve, 0.92) included 8 predictors: number of prior AP episodes; history of cholelithiasis; no abdominal surgery (prior 2 months); time elapsed from symptom onset; pain localized to epigastrium, of progressively worsening severity, and severity level at presentation; and extent of lipase elevation. At a diagnostic risk threshold of 8 points or higher (≥ 99%), the model identified AP with a sensitivity of 45%, and a specificity and a positive predictive value of 100%.

Conclusions

In emergency department patients with lipase elevated to 3 times the upper limit of normal or greater, this model helps identify AP risk before imaging. Prospective validation studies are needed to confirm diagnostic accuracy.
