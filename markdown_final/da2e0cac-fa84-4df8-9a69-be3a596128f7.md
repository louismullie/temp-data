## Question

How long to keep octreotide infusion for suspected GI bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to continue an octreotide infusion for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding, and how to tailor that duration to variceal versus non-variceal sources and to endoscopic outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the bleeding is likely variceal or non-variceal. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for duration in variceal bleeding. Next, I will examine randomized trials that tested shorter courses to see if 1–2 days can be equivalent to 5 days. After that, I need to check whether non-variceal upper GI bleeding benefits from octreotide at all. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations, and I should double-check for any exceptions like portal hypertensive gastropathy or special populations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because duration hinges on etiology. Suspected variceal bleeding in cirrhosis warrants immediate vasoactive therapy while awaiting endoscopy, whereas non-variceal upper GI bleeding is typically managed with acid suppression and endoscopic therapy rather than octreotide, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios before deciding on duration [^111PEAPB] [^114evqZF].

> Now, for suspected variceal bleeding, I should confirm guideline-directed duration. Multiple high-quality sources converge on 2–5 days of vasoactive therapy initiated at presentation and continued after endoscopic hemostasis to prevent early rebleeding: ESGE 2022 recommends up to 5 days, AASLD 2024 specifies 2–5 days, and AGA 2023 advises 2–5 days after initial hemostasis, with octreotide favored for its safety profile. FDA labeling likewise lists 2–5 days for acute variceal hemorrhage, which aligns with this consensus [^111PEAPB] [^115XstJp] [^115aVUFf] [^1119ewtb].

> Wait, let me verify whether shorter courses can be equivalent in selected patients. A 2025 randomized trial found that 1 day of octreotide after successful band ligation was non-inferior to 5 days for early rebleeding, with fewer transfusions and shorter hospital stay, suggesting that in low-risk patients with secure endoscopic control, 1 day may suffice. Similarly, a 2015 RCT comparing 2 versus 5 days showed comparable early rebleeding and mortality with better cost-effectiveness for the 2-day arm, and an updated meta-analysis indicates that shortening vasoactive therapy to about 2 days alongside band ligation appears safe in selected populations, though benefits may not extend to sclerotherapy or to patients with more severe liver disease [^112hJuyw] [^115iJVV3] [^114UCxYn] [^114xJH5Z].

> Hold on, I should verify the caveats before recommending shorter durations broadly. Shorter courses look acceptable primarily when endoscopic band ligation achieves definitive hemostasis and the patient is lower risk; in contrast, when sclerotherapy is used or when patients have Child-Pugh C or high-risk features, longer durations up to 5 days remain prudent because of higher rebleeding risk and hemodynamic vulnerability, so I need to ensure risk stratification before truncating therapy [^114UCxYn] [^114xJH5Z].

> Next, I should review non-variceal upper GI bleeding, because I don't want to overextend octreotide where it doesn't help. Guidelines do not recommend octreotide for non-variceal bleeding; high-dose PPI is the pharmacologic cornerstone after endoscopic hemostasis, and adding octreotide has not shown improved outcomes in observational cohorts, so duration becomes moot in this scenario and octreotide should be discontinued if varices are excluded [^114evqZF] [^115rzKdW] [^115BaWxM].

> I will now examine dosing and administration to ensure the plan is complete. Standard practice is an initial 50 mcg IV bolus followed by 50 mcg/h continuous infusion for the intended duration, with the option to repeat the bolus if bleeding persists; this regimen is reflected in AASLD guidance and FDA labeling, and it dovetails with the 2–5 day duration framework used in trials and guidelines [^115i7KMC] [^1119ewtb].

> But wait, what if the source is portal hypertensive gastropathy rather than frank variceal rupture. In that case, vasoactive therapy with octreotide for 2–5 days is reasonable as part of acute management, with transition to nonselective beta-blockers for secondary prophylaxis, so I should keep this exception in mind when tailoring duration and follow-up therapy [^114rZFGp].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it against the evidence. Start octreotide immediately when variceal bleeding is suspected, continue through endoscopic therapy, and then individualize duration: if band ligation achieves secure hemostasis and the patient is lower risk, 1–2 days may suffice based on RCTs and meta-analyses; if sclerotherapy was used, if the patient is Child-Pugh C or has active bleeding at endoscopy, or if there is any concern for early rebleeding, continue to the full 5 days; if non-variceal bleeding is confirmed, stop octreotide and pivot to PPI-based therapy and definitive endoscopic management [^112hJuyw] [^115iJVV3] [^114UCxYn] [^111PEAPB] [^115aVUFf] [^114evqZF].

> Finally, I should confirm supportive measures that accompany duration decisions. Restrictive transfusion with hemoglobin thresholds around 7 g/dL, prophylactic antibiotics such as ceftriaxone for 5–7 days, and urgent endoscopy within 12 hours when feasible are integral to care and can influence the safety of shorter octreotide courses by reducing infections and improving visualization and hemostasis, so I need to ensure these are addressed in parallel [^111PEAPB] [^115VdJCX].

For suspected variceal GI bleeding, start octreotide immediately [^111PEAPB] and continue for **2–5 days** [^115XstJp] after endoscopic hemostasis to prevent early rebleeding [^115aVUFf]. If endoscopy shows non-variceal bleeding, **stop octreotide** [^114evqZF] and switch to PPI therapy [^115rzKdW]. For refractory or recurrent bleeding, consider extending to 5 days [^111PEAPB] or adding terlipressin [^notfound]; monitor for tachyphylaxis with prolonged use [^116Ti6ax].

---

## Indications for octreotide infusion

Octreotide is indicated for **acute variceal bleeding** from esophageal or gastric varices in patients with portal hypertension [^111PEAPB]. It is **not recommended for non-variceal upper GI bleeding**, such as peptic ulcer disease or Mallory-Weiss tears [^114evqZF].

---

## Recommended duration of octreotide infusion

The recommended duration of octreotide infusion varies by **clinical context**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected variceal bleeding (pre-endoscopy) | Initiate immediately and continue until endoscopy | Strong recommendation [^111Cnsyr] |
| Confirmed variceal bleeding (post-endoscopic hemostasis) | 2–5 days [^115XstJp] | Strong recommendation [^111Cnsyr] |
| Refractory or recurrent variceal bleeding | Extend to 5 days or add terlipressin | Moderate recommendation [^notfound] |
| Non-variceal bleeding | Discontinue octreotide; switch to PPI | Strong recommendation [^115rzKdW] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration recommendations

- **ESGE 2022**: Initiate vasoactive agents (octreotide, terlipressin, or somatostatin) immediately in suspected variceal bleeding and continue for up to 5 days [^111PEAPB].
- **AASLD 2024**: Octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus, then 50 mcg/h infusion for 2–5 days [^115XstJp].
- **AGA 2021**: Continue vasoactive therapy for 2–5 days after initial endoscopic hemostasis to prevent early rebleeding [^115aVUFf].

---

## Factors influencing duration of octreotide infusion

Several factors influence the **duration of octreotide infusion**:

- **Severity of liver disease**: Child-Pugh C or MELD > 18 may require longer infusion (up to 5 days) [^114UCxYn].
- **Endoscopic findings**: Active bleeding or high-risk features may necessitate extended infusion [^114yJm1H].
- **Response to therapy**: Persistent or recurrent bleeding may require prolonged infusion or additional agents [^1173hE3F].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Comorbidities, hemodynamic stability, and response to initial therapy [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged octreotide infusion

Prolonged octreotide infusion (> 5 days) is generally not recommended due to the risk of **tachyphylaxis** [^116Ti6ax] and limited additional benefit. However, in select cases of refractory bleeding, extending therapy may be considered with close monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and assessment during octreotide infusion

During octreotide infusion, clinicians should monitor for:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Blood pressure, heart rate, and signs of ongoing bleeding [^114VZvT6].
- **Laboratory parameters**: Hemoglobin, renal function, and electrolytes [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms, gallbladder abnormalities, and hyperglycemia [^notfound].
- **Response to therapy**: Clinical signs of bleeding control and need for rescue therapy [^111Cnsyr].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate octreotide immediately** in suspected variceal bleeding and continue until endoscopy [^111PEAPB].
- **Continue octreotide for 2–5 days** after successful endoscopic hemostasis [^115XstJp].
- **Discontinue octreotide** if non-variceal bleeding is confirmed; switch to PPI therapy [^114evqZF].
- **Extend infusion to 5 days** or add terlipressin for refractory or recurrent bleeding [^111PEAPB].
- **Monitor closely** for adverse effects and response to therapy throughout infusion [^112TBySt].

---

The recommended duration of octreotide infusion for suspected GI bleeding is **2–5 days**, tailored to clinical context, severity of liver disease, and response to therapy. Prolonged infusion beyond 5 days is generally not recommended due to tachyphylaxis and limited additional benefit [^115XstJp].

Variceal hemorrhage

Perioperative volume overload can increase portal pressure and precipitate bleeding from esophageal varices. Other possible contributing factors include postoperative hepatic dysfunction and portal venous thrombosis. Variceal hemorrhage represents a medical emergency to be managed in the intensive care unit.

Resuscitative measures to preserve the respiratory and circulatory systems should be promptly initiated. A restrictive transfusion strategy aiming at hemoglobin levels of 7–9 g/dl has been associated with decreased re-bleeding and mortality rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone for up to 7 days is indicated to address the increased risk of bacterial infections and also to decrease the risk of re-bleeding and mortality. Infusion of vasoactive agents (somatostatin, terlipressin, and octreotide) for 2 to 5 days has been associated with lower mortality and transfusion requirements.

An urgent endoscopy should be completed no longer than 12 h from presentation. Elastic band ligation represents the first-line endoscopic intervention for esophageal varices, but sclerotherapy is an excellent alternative for difficult cases. Elastic band ligation has proven more effective than sclerotherapy in terms of the number of required sessions, as well as re-bleeding and mortality rates. A non-specific beta-blocker (propranolol or nadolol) is indicated after the vasoactive infusion is discontinued.

Balloon tamponade is reserved for temporary control of ongoing variceal bleeding while definitive therapy is being arranged. TIPS should be considered pre-emptively in high-risk patients, or in refractory or recurrent hemorrhage, as improved mortality rates have been observed.

Table 3 summarizes current recommendations for the management of hemorrhage from esophageal varices.

Management of variceal hemorrhage

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Coagulation disorders of cirrhosis confer an increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage. As previously indicated, conventional coagulation tests do not reflect these risks, and an increased INR is not necessarily protective for thromboembolic events. Although detailed guidelines remain unavailable, thromboprophylaxis is recommended in most patients, and certainly in high-risk situations.

### One versus five days of octreotide infusion for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^112hJuyw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The optimal duration of octreotide infusion for esophageal variceal bleeding remains unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 1-day versus 5-day octreotide infusion combined with endoscopic therapy, with the primary outcome of early (5-day) re-bleeding under a non-inferiority framework and secondary outcomes of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

Methods

This nationwide, multicenter, non-inferiority, open-label, randomized, controlled trial included 220 patients with cirrhosis and acute esophageal variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic band ligation in five tertiary-care and three university-based hospitals across Thailand. They received a 1-day (n = 109) or 5-day (n = 111) regimen of continuous octreotide infusion after successful endoscopy. Re-bleeding, transfusion requirements, and mortality were assessed.

Results

The majority of participants were men (180/220), and the average age was 56 years. The 5-day re-bleeding (1.83% vs. 1.80%, p ≥ 0.99), 6-week re-bleeding (8.26% vs. 10.81%, p = 0.52), and 6-week all-cause mortality (5.50% vs. 6.31%, p = 0.80) rates were similar between the 1- and 5-day groups. The event-rate difference in early re-bleeding was 0.03%, indicating non-inferiority (95% CI, 3.50–3.56%). Patients in the 1-day group required significantly fewer blood transfusions and had a shorter time to oral diet and shorter hospital stay.

Conclusions

Following successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^116EgERE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of medical therapy is to reduce splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure. Drugs currently in use are vasopressin, somatostatin, and terlipressin. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs lowers portal pressure and potentially offers the endoscopist a clearer field to work in and it is the only non-invasive treatment for non-esophagogastric variceal sites of bleeding related to portal hypertension. There are no trials available regarding the use of these vasoactive drugs for the treatment of bleeding ARV, but these drugs are clearly beneficial when used for acute bleeding from gastro-esophageal varices and therefore can be considered for use in bleeding ARV. Vasopressin has a short half-life and should be given as a continuous iv infusion; furthermore, vasopressin has relevant side effects related to the important systemic vasoconstriction that could lead to mesenteric or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, vasopressin is not often used also because Terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analog with a longer half-life and less adverse effects, is effective in bleeding control and has a positive impact on survival. Both somatostatin and octreotide (a synthetic analog of somatostatin with longer half-life) have a good safety profile, and somatostatin is as effective as vasopressin in control of variceal bleeding. A literature review by Biecker analyzed all the studies regarding the use of these drugs for the medical treatment of acute bleeding from esophageal varices and concluded that the available data is most convincing for terlipressin; however, the direct comparison of terlipressin and octreotide revealed no superiority of terlipressin. All the studies mentioned so far regard bleeding from esophageal varices, we can try to extend these indications to the varices of other districts of the body, but the grade of recommendations is necessarily weak and further studies are needed to define the best medical approach to bleeding ARV.

Regarding medical management for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to vasoactive agents, ESGE 2022 guidelines recommend to administer vasoactive agents (terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin) initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and continue for a duration of up to 5 days.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^116yizK2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Small bowel bleeding — supportive care and antithrombotic management emphasize that supportive care with iron given orally or intravenously is a mainstay of treatment for mild small intestinal bleeding, and in more severe bleeding transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is an essential element of treatment; although anticoagulation has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent bleeding, there is no prospective data showing that withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy is beneficial; in a 2009 analysis, risk factors for recurrent bleeding after double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) included small bowel vascular disorders and comorbid conditions, but not the usage of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy, and a 2010 follow-up showed predictors included transfusional requirements and number and type of vascular lesions, but not anticoagulant usage; there is no data that cessation of antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk for recurrent bleeding; overall, specific medical treatment is poorly developed, hormonal therapy has not been shown to be helpful, and thalidomide and octreotide have been shown to have some benefit.

### No difference in mortality between terlipressin and somatostatin treatments in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding and renal functional impairment [^112N1khm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

About 30% of cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices will experience EVB during their lifetime. Mortality rates have been reduced because of improvements in the management of patients with EVB, but the risk of mortality is still high. This large population-based study showed a similar poor outcome because of EVB. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 17.6%.

Besides endoscopic treatment, prophylactic antibiotics and splanchnic vasoconstrictors (such as octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin, or vasopressin) are recommended as first-line treatment if patients are suspected of having acute variceal bleeding. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of vasoactive medications in patients who experience acute variceal bleeding. The use of vasoactive agents can lower the risk of 7-day mortality, improve the hemostatic effect, decrease transfusion requirements, and shorten the duration of hospitalization. However, the choice of splanchnic vasoconstriction agents for EVB remains an important issue.

To date, cumulative randomized prospective studies had been carried out to compare the effectiveness of terlipressin and octreotide for the control of acute variceal bleeding. All of them concluded that the efficiency of terlipressin and octreotide in controlling variceal bleeding was not different in terms of the hemostatic effect, safety, hospital stay, or mortality. In this national population-based study, we compared the mortality between two different vasoactive agents: terlipressin and somatostatin. There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality rate between patients treated with terlipressin versus those treated with somatostatin. We have also provided evidence on similar effects between terlipressin and somatostatin in terms of EVB after EVL. The choice of vasoactive drugs in cases of acute variceal bleeding, therefore, should be made on the basis of drug availability and the physician's experience.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114evqZF]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^114zZw6h]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage — initiation of vasoactive therapy is guided by Best Practice Advice 1, which states that vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is described as a major complication of cirrhosis with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%–13% and a 6-week mortality rate of 7%–43% and accounts for approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Vasoactive drugs for AVH can be divided into somatostatin and its analogs (octreotide in most countries) and vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin); these agents work via vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation and thereby reduce portal pressure, can halt acute hemorrhage in up to 80% of cases, and are given intravenously.

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^111q1HFM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As part of the ED management, majority of the patients received intravenous fluids and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Although international guidelines such as the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Guidelines (ESGE) suggest use of high dose PPI followed by an hourly infusion, 19 (59.4%) patients with a high clinical Rockall score of ≥ 4 received an initial high dose PPI. It is worthy to note that none of the patients received the hourly PPI infusion as recommended in the guidelines. A knowledge gap concerning the current recommendations amongst the medical care providers maybe the plausible to this shortcoming. As per the departmental protocol, PPI should be given to all patients presenting with UGIB. This may reason out to why PPI was the first choice of drug prior to undergoing endoscopy. A small proportion of the patients received octreotide, although only half of them had indication for its use based on historical features (such esophageal varices and liver diseases) and many of those with such a history did not receive this medication. The utilization was probably limited by the availability and the cost of the drug in our setting. But the fact that some received it inappropriately suggests a knowledge gap. Antibiotic administration especially in patients with prior history of liver disease and esophageal varices was low. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, emphasizes prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleed or a history suggestive of liver disease including cirrhosis. Provision of antibiotics was associated with increased incidence of mortality only in univariate analysis, probably due to confounding with the presence of liver disease which is associated with a poor outcome. Finally, despite the high proportion of patients with severe anemia, less than half of the patients received transfusion. A previous study carried out at MNH, revealed difficulties in obtaining blood for transfusion, including a general unavailability of blood, scarcity of un-cross matched blood at the blood bank along with delays in obtaining blood. It is worth noting that ED management of UGIB is guided by the presence of departmental protocol for various conditions including UGIB. As such, provision of certain management may be guided by the protocol.

### Effects of a somatostatin analogue in occult gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^113b7KGR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a patient with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and anaemia, who required repeated transfusions for about 1 year. Because of the absence of a certain diagnosis and of a surgical approach indication, we established long-acting octreotide therapy, obtaining clinical stabilisation and interruption of the transfusional need. Withdrawal of long-acting somatostatin analogue therapy was associated with renewal of bleeding that was again successfully stopped by continuous i.v. somatostatin administration followed by re-establishment of the long-acting octreotide therapy. We suggested, in absence of surgical indications and when only palliative therapies are available, a therapeutic approach with long-term SMS analogues in patients with lower digestive bleeding of a known or unknown source.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^117PgDiW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Small-bowel angioectasias and iron-deficiency anemia — In patients undergoing small-bowel evaluation for IDA, angioectasias have a diagnostic yield of 20% to 40%, and a meta-analysis of 14 studies and 623 patients found an overall rebleeding rate of 34% and 45% for small-bowel angioectasias. Radiofrequency ablation is considered experimental and, in a case series, a 20% rebleeding rate over a 6-month period was observed; adjunct medical therapy with somatostatin analogues may reduce transfusion requirements and rebleeding although the evidence is not robust, with octreotide noted to be more effective than lanreotide. There have been 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antiangiogenic therapy with thalidomide showing reductions in transfusions and rehospitalizations secondary to bleeding and a dose-dependent reduction in rebleeding measured 1 year after treatment, but with significant adverse reactions; therefore, use of antiangiogenic therapy should be reserved for those who have failed all other forms of therapy and should be given by providers with experience with thalidomide.

### Octreotide therapy for control of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^112hn1ko]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the outcomes of octreotide use in children with gastrointestinal bleeding with or without portal hypertension.

Methods

The medical charts of children who received continuous octreotide infusion for the indication of gastrointestinal bleeding from January 1995 to December 2000 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Twenty-one children with portal hypertension received octreotide infusions (1–2 microg/kg/h) during 35 gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. The duration of infusion ranged from 19 hours to 7 days. Bleeding ceased in 71% of children. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 52%, and the mortality was 19%. Response to octreotide, rebleeding, and mortality did not differ significantly between patients with or without intrinsic liver disease. Twelve children with gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension received octreotide during 14 episodes. The duration of octreotide ranged from 3 hours to 36 days. Fifty percent of children had resolution of bleeding during the infusion. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 29%, and the mortality was 50%. No major adverse events were observed in either group.

Conclusions

A high rate of bleeding control was achieved with octreotide during acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children with portal hypertension. However, controlled studies are needed for more definitive description of its clinical effects. The role of octreotide is less clear in gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^1173hE3F]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

Portal hypertensive bleeding and ascites management in critically ill ACLF patients — We recommend performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy no later than 12 hr of presentation in critically ill ACLF patients with portal hypertensive bleeding (known or suspected). We recommend performing LVP with measurement of intra-abdominal pressure in critically ill ACLF patients with tense ascites and intra-abdominal hypertension or hemodynamic, renal or respiratory compromise. We recommend using antibiotic prophylaxis in critically ill ACLF patients with any type of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We recommend using octreotide or somatostatin analog for the treatment of portal hypertensive bleeding in critically ill ACLF patients. We recommend using proton pump inhibitors in critically ill ACLF patients with portal hypertensive bleeding.

### Long-acting octreotide is effective in controlling rebleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract [^115ZyxsR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Management of bleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract is often a major clinical problem. Lesions are frequently multiple, not detectable or missed during conventional endoscopy and patients are sometimes at high risk for complications because of advanced age and serious concomitant disorders.

Aims

To determine the efficacy of a new formulation of somatostatin analogue (octreotide long-acting) in management of recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia in patients resistant to endoscopic treatment and not suitable for surgery.

Patients and Methods

Three patients with recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract were treated with long-acting octreotide administered intramuscularly 20 mg monthly to each individual. The number of admissions for acute bleeding, hospital stay and number of blood units transfused before and after treatment (followup: 15–17 months) were regularly monitored.

Results

In each patient, a relevant decrease in number of hospital admissions, duration of hospital stay, number of administered blood units was seen and mean haemoglobin values significantly increased in all of them after introducing long-acting octreotide therapy.

Conclusions

This is the first report on use of long-acting octreotide in bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract. Data suggest that long-acting octreotide is a safe drug and is successful in controlling recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia in elderly patients not eligible for surgical or endoscopic therapy.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding after endoscopic hemostasis — The panel made a strong recommendation for high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy given continuously or intermittently for 3 days after successful endoscopic hemostatic treatment; high-dose PPI therapy, defined as ≥ 80 mg daily for ≥ 3 days, given continuously or intermittently after endoscopic hemostatic therapy reduces further bleeding and mortality. Continuous therapy should be 80-mg bolus followed by 8-mg/hr infusion, and for intermittent dosing we suggest 80-mg bolus followed by 40 mg 2–4 times daily, with average total daily doses of 80–160 mg (some with an initial 80 mg bolus).

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70–90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Multicenter evaluation of octreotide as secondary prophylaxis in patients with left ventricular assist devices and gastrointestinal bleeding [^112BhwRP]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one of the most common complications after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation. More than one third of patients with incident bleed go on to develop recurrent GI bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is proposed to reduce the risk of recurrent GI bleeding in this population.

Methods and Results

This multicenter, retrospective analysis evaluated 51 continuous-flow left ventricular assist device patients who received secondary prophylaxis with octreotide after their index GI bleed from 2009 to 2015. All patients had a hospitalization for GI bleed and received octreotide after discharge. Patient demographics, medical and medication history, and clinical characteristics of patients who rebled after receiving octreotide were compared with non-rebleeders. These data were also compared with matched historical control patients previously enrolled in the HMII (HeartMate II) clinical trials, none of whom received octreotide, to provide a context for the bleeding rates. Twelve patients (24%) who received secondary octreotide prophylaxis developed another GI bleed, whereas 39 (76%) did not. There were similar intergroup demographics; however, significantly more bleeders had a previous GI bleeding history before left ventricular assist device placement (33% versus 5%; P = 0.02) and greater frequency of angiodysplasia confirmed during endoscopy (58% versus 23%; P = 0.03). Fewer patients in this study experienced a recurrent GI bleed compared with a matched historical control group that did not receive octreotide (24% versus 43%; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device receiving secondary prophylaxis with octreotide had a significantly lower GI bleed recurrence compared with historical controls not treated with octreotide. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these data.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^11451o1F]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

VWD patients with gastrointestinal bleeding should be treated immediately with VWF/FVIII concentrates. In addition, endoscopic management is needed to be able to treat local sites of bleeding. Many VWD patients have recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, despite treatment with factor concentrates. This may be caused by angiodysplasia or vascular malformations in the intestines, which give a higher chance for continuation of bleeding or re‐bleeding (Makris et al, 2015; Tsagianni et al, 2019). Many drugs have been used to treat VWD patients with persistent gastrointestinal bleeding. The effectiveness of octreotide and thalidomide has been shown in the treatment of angiodysplasia‐related gastrointestinal bleeding in the general population (Iannone et al, 2016). For VWD patients, this has only been reported in small case series (Bowers et al, 2000; Engelen et al, 2015). Statins, which have anti‐angiogenetic properties, have also been reported to reduce bleeding in intractable gastrointestinal bleeding in VWD patients (Sohal & Laffan, 2008; Alikhan & Keeling, 2010). The use of lenalidomide as treatment for angiodysplasia‐related gastro intestinal bleeding in VWD was recently reported to be successful in increasing bleed‐free duration (Khatri et al, 2018). It was also recently shown in one case with type 2A VWD that rVWF, containing high content of HMW multimers, was effective in the treatment of severe gastrointestinal bleeding that was unresponsive to other standard treatments for VWD (Brown, 2017). It is noteworthy that the previously mentioned case reports may be subjected to publication bias, and therefore well‐designed studies are needed to assess the efficacy and side‐effects of these drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding in VWD patients.

In our centre, we only use thalidomide and statins in patient with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding despite local measures and on‐demand infusion of FVIII/VWF concentrates. If bleeding persists we initiate long‐term prophylaxis with FVIII/VWF concentrate (Saccullo & Makris, 2016).

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^114FARRG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and octreotide

Somatostatin causes selective splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal pressure and portal blood flow. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. The mechanism of action of these two agents is not clear. Inhibition of glucagon increases vasodilatation rather than a direct vasoconstrictive effect and post-prandial gut hyperaemia is also reduced. The actions of octreotide on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics are transient, making continuous infusion necessary. Octreotide is given as a 50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 25–50 μg/h. Somatostatin is given as a 250 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mg/h. Somatostatin and octreotide have been shown to be as effective as terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding in a meta-analysis. Seo et al in a large RCT of 780 patients comparing these three agents failed to show a difference in treatment success (range 83.8–86.2%), rebleeding (range 3.4–4.4%) and mortality (range 8–8.8%). A low systolic blood pressure at presentation, high serum creatinine level, active bleeding in the emergency endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding and Child–Pugh grade C were independent factors predicting 5-day treatment failure.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics that provide Gram-negative cover are one of the interventions which positively influence survival in variceal haemorrhage as shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Antibiotics were also shown to reduce bacterial infections (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97) and early rebleeding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74). Therefore, short-term antibiotics should be considered standard practice in all cirrhotic patients who have a variceal bleed, irrespective of the presence of confirmed infection. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (1 g IV, daily), have been shown to be more effective at reducing Gram-negative sepsis than oral norfloxacin, but choice of antibiotics must be dictated by local resistance patterns and availability.

### Octreotide added to a proton pump inhibitor versus a proton pump inhibitor alone in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeds [^115BaWxM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Literature indicating clinically relevant benefits of an adjunctive somatostatin analog to standard therapies in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is lacking. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to find the association between outcomes in patients with NVUGIB treated with octreotide and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; combination group) compared with those treated with a PPI alone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted within a 5-hospital health care system with a NVUGIB treated with a PPI continuous infusion with or without an octreotide infusion. Notable exclusion criteria included varices, history of cirrhosis without endoscopy, or active gastrointestinal cancer. The primary outcome was association of combination treatment versus PPI alone with hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: A total of 180 patients were included (combination group: n = 90; PPI: n = 90). In univariate analyses, the median hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS in the combination group versus PPI was 6.1 versus 4.9 days (P = 0.25) and 2.3 versus 1.9 days (P = 0.24), and rebleeding and mortality occurred in 9% versus 12% (P = 0.63) and 6.7% versus 5.6% (P = 1.00) of patients. Median units of packed red blood cells in the combination therapy versus PPI group was 3 vs 2 units (P = 0.43). After propensity score adjustment in multivariable analyses, hospital and ICU LOS, rebleeding, and mortality all remained nonsignificant. Conclusion and Relevance: Our study observed no difference in clinical end points. This suggests that octreotide provides no additional major clinical benefit in NVUGIB, and PPI therapy alone may be sufficient.

### OCTREOTIDE ACETATE injection, for subcutaneous or… [^116yoKiV]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63%. The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately.

Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63%. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors, and VIP secreting adenomas. Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased.

Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t1/2 increasing to 3. 7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to
5. 9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t1/2 increased to 3. 4 hr and total body clearance of
8. 2 L/hr.

### Pro / con debate: octreotide has an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin? [^1167PeBM]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Whether it is the primary reason for admission or a complication of critical illness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is commonly encountered in the intensive care unit. In this setting, in the absence of endoscopy, intensivists generally provide supportive care (transfusion of blood products) and acid suppression (such as proton pump inhibitors). More recently, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) has been used in such patients. However, its precise role in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not necessarily clear and the drug is associated with significant costs. In this issue of Critical Care, two expert teams debate the merits of using octreotide in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in athletes [^115TG9YA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of GIB in athletes

GIB in athletes is usually self-limited, with rare reported cases of significant blood loss. An approach to the treatment of GIB in athletes is suggested in Fig. 2.

Figure 2
An approach to the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in athletes

It is important to point out that GIB should not be attributed to endurance athleticism before other potentially serious causes of GIB that also apply to the general population have been excluded. Athletes who present with GIB should always be advised to undergo endoscopy of both the upper and lower GI tract to rule out other causes of hemorrhage, such as inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal neoplasia, esophageal varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, peptic ulcers, coagulopathies, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulosis, vascular ectasias, and systemic vasculitis.

In cases of overt bleeding in endurance training or events, athletes should immediately cease every activity and seek medical care. Treatment for overt GIB in athletes is similar to that in the general population. Hemodynamic stability should be assessed immediately. Patients with severe bleeding may be in need of resuscitation with intravenous crystalloids and transfusions. PPIs are useful for ulcers, erosions or gastritis, while vasoactive drugs such as somatostatin or octreotide should be used when varices are suspected as the cause of upper GIB. Some patients require emergency endoscopy or radiographic interventions in order to achieve hemostasis. In rare cases, surgery might be required to stop the bleeding.

Occult bleeding occurs more frequently, especially in endurance athletes. Endoscopy should be recommended in all athletes with occult GIB, especially those who present with anemia. In the case of sports anemia with decreased ferritin, iron supplementation might be helpful. Iron can be supplied through nutrition, oral supplements or intravenous infusion. Athletes with repeatedly low ferritin values seem to benefit from intermittent oral iron substitution. Medications that reduce gastric acid secretion, such as H₂-receptor antagonists and PPIs, have been shown to be effective in treating gastritis caused by endurance training. Stool softeners might be useful for athletes with fissures or hemorrhoids. As in the general population, athletes who have persistent GIB not responding to therapy or lower sports intensity, and had negative initial endoscopy, should be advised to repeat the endoscopy to rule out GIB causes that were not identified the first time.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UCxYn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) spans 2–5 days. Prior meta-analyses of randomized trials include only a few studies that compared short vs. long vasoactive drug durations approximating this time range, including older management techniques, and only assessed variceal rebleeding at 5 days. We identified several additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing rebleeding at various durations, with updated management of EVB.

Methods

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of shortening the vasoactive drug duration by 48–72 h. The primary outcome was rebleeding within 5 days. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality within 4–6 weeks (extended period) with subgroup analysis by vasoactive drug and type of endoscopic therapy. Length of stay, blood transfusion requirements and terlipressin-related adverse events were additional secondary outcomes.

Results

Our comprehensive search strategy and screening process yielded 14 RCTs with 1060 patients (75.1% male): 7 trials used terlipressin, 4 octreotide, and 3 somatostatin. Shortened durations combined with band ligation led to similar rebleeding, with a trend towards less rebleeding when populations with more severe liver disease were excluded. There was greater rebleeding and mortality over an extended period when shorter durations were combined with sclerotherapy. Longer durations were associated with a longer hospital stay and, for terlipressin, more adverse events.

Conclusions

Shorter vasoactive drug durations combined with band ligation in selected populations appear safe. Higher powered RCTs are needed, involving patients with different degrees of severity of EVB and liver disease.

### The 2023 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: a 10-year update [^1167MLHw]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support — recurrent mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding and preventive therapies in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients: Recurrence can be encountered in 30% to 40% of patients on LVAD support, and if the source of bleeding remains unidentified or is not amenable to endoscopic or surgical interventions, then alterations in anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy should be considered; risks and benefits should be weighed, and there are presently no robust data to support the safety or efficacy of changes in pump speed to promote pulsatility. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have been correlated with a reduced risk of all-cause GIB and AVM-associated GIB in patients with LVADs, with a protective effect having a dose threshold of > 5 mg of daily lisinopril equivalence. In a nonrandomized study utilizing historic controls, patients with continuous-flow LVADs receiving secondary prophylaxis with octreotide had a significantly lower GIB recurrence, and octreotide can be administered in subcutaneous (100–200 mcg 2–3 times daily) and depot (20 mg monthly) formulation; data are lacking to support a specific formulation and duration, the efficacy of other therapies such as digoxin, thalidomide, and omega-3 therapy has not been shown in well designed and well powered studies, and thalidomide has been associated with increased thrombotic tendency and requires strict precautions due to teratogenicity.

### Incidence and management of gastrointestinal bleeding with continuous flow assist devices [^113m4iy4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) have emerged as the standard of care for patients in advanced heart failure (HF) requiring long-term mechanical circulatory support. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.

Results

A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93%) population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95% CI, 2.2–228.6; p = 0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2–12.9; p = 0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98–0.99; p = 0.001) were independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years; p = 0.01). The majority of bleeders (60%) rebled from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct consequence of GI bleeding.

Conclusions

Multiple factors account for GI bleeding in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk significantly and warrants careful monitoring.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^111NKKKY]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages; median survival is more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. With each stage, there is progressive worsening of portal hypertension and the vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion. Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is used in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is used in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and because recent trials have explored use of IV albumin in other settings, it was considered that a best practice update would be relevant regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following 3 specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Some of the statements are unchanged from published guidelines because of lack of new evidence in the literature. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality and evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: After initial endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive drugs should be continued for 2–5 days to prevent early rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Octreotide is the vasoactive drug of choice in the management of variceal hemorrhage based on its safety profile. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: IV albumin may be considered in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Albumin should not be used in patients (hospitalized or not) with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Vasoconstrictors should not be used in the management of uncomplicated ascites, after large-volume paracentesis or in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: IV albumin is the volume expander of choice in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vasoactive drugs (eg, terlipressin, norepinephrine, and combination of octreotide and midodrine) should be used in the treatment of HRS-AKI, but not in other forms of AKI in cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Terlipressin is the vasoactive drug of choice in the treatment of HRS-AKI and use of concurrent albumin can be considered when accounting for patient's volume status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Terlipressin treatment does not require intensive care unit monitoring and can be administered intravenously through a peripheral line. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Terlipressin use is contraindicated in patients with hypoxemia and in patients with ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia, and should be used with caution in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3. The benefits may not outweigh the risks in patients with serum creatinine > 5 mg/dL and in patients listed for transplantation with a Model for End-stage Liver Disease ≥ 35.

### Lack of difference among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in the control of acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^113MNNYX]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasoactive drugs are recommended to be started as soon as possible in suspected variceal bleeding, even before diagnostic endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the therapeutic efficacies of the various vasoactive drugs used are comparable. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial was to characterize the effects of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when they are initiated before endoscopic treatment in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive early administration of terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide, followed by endoscopic treatment. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding were excluded after endoscopy. The primary endpoint was 5-day treatment success, defined as control of bleeding without rescue treatment, rebleeding, or mortality, with a noninferiority margin of 0.1. In total, 780 patients with variceal bleeding were enrolled: 261 in the terlipressin group; 259 in the somatostatin group; and 260 in the octreotide group. At the time of initial endoscopy, active bleeding was noted in 43.7%, 44.4%, and 43.5% of these patients, respectively (P = 0.748), and treatment success was achieved by day 5 in 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.8% (P = 0.636), with similar rates of control of bleeding without rescue treatment (89.7%, 87.6%, and 88.1%; P = 0.752), rebleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, and 4.4%; P = 0.739), or mortality (8.0%, 8.9%, and 8.8%; P = 0.929). The absolute values of the lower bound of confidence intervals for terlipressin versus somatostatin, terlilpressin versus octreotide, and octreotide versus somatostatin were 0.095, 0.090, and 0.065, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemostatic effects and safety did not differ significantly between terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide as adjuvants to endoscopic treatment in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

### Response to the NCEPOD report: development of a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis-the first 24 H [^117VoWwe]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected variceal bleeding, terlipressin (2 mg four times daily) should be administered intravenously as soon as possible to control bleeding. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that reduces portal pressure by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction and has been shown to improve control of bleeding, as well as reduce all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and with variceal bleeding. Significant adverse events with terlipressin are uncommon, but because of its vasoconstrictor activity it should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and those older than 65 years of age, making a baseline ECG mandatory. For patients who have a contraindication to terlipressin (or if terlipressin is unavailable), a continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide is an alternative. Once patients have been adequately resuscitated, endoscopy should be performed at the earliest opportunity (ideally within 6–12 h, but not more than 24 h) to determine the cause of bleeding and perform endotherapy as indicated. Bacterial infections, particularly SBP, are common in patients with cirrhosis in the first 7 days post-GI bleeding, occurring in 25%–65% of patients. Prophylaxis with antibiotics post-GI bleed have been shown to reduce short-term mortality, as well as the risk of rebleeding, septicaemia and SBP. It is, therefore, recommended that patients with cirrhosis and GI bleeding (variceal and non-variceal) receive prophylaxis with a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as cefotaxime or co-amoxiclav, as per hospital protocol, as soon as possible. Patients with advanced cirrhosis (any two of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy or jaundice) are at highest risk of developing infection and should receive the antibiotics intravenously. Importantly, there appears to be no increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for variceal bleeding compared with the hospital medical population.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1142QfMd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Somatostatin analogs

Increasingly, studies have shown that octreotide is an effective option for the management of bleeding from angiodysplasia and should be strongly considered in those with recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic intervention. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog whose reported mechanism of action includes decreasing splanchnic blood flow, inhibiting angiogenesis, improving platelet aggregation and increasing vascular resistance.

A review by Jackson and Gerson found that somatostatin analogs were effective in reducing recurrent bleeding episodes and transfusion requirements with a pooled OR of 14.5 (95%CI 5.9–36). A 2010 meta-analysis of studies reporting the use of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of angiodysplasia determined a clinical response of 76%, with a weighted mean difference in transfusion requirements before and after treatment of −2.2 (95%CI −3.9 to −0.5). Another study followed patients with recurrent GI bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia after at least 6 months of treatment with a somatostatin analog. Following treatment, the rate of bleeding episodes was reduced from 73% to 20%, the number of transfusions needed dropped from a median of 10 to 2, and the mean hemoglobin increased from a median of 7 to 10 g/dL. Similarly, a prospective study evaluated the efficacy of 1-year octreotide treatment in patients with chronic bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia. Complete response without the need for transfusion or iron supplementation was achieved in 69% of patients, a partial response in 8% of patients and no response in 23% of patients.

A 2017 study evaluated the use of combination endoscopic therapy and the somatostatin analog lanreotide compared to endoscopic therapy alone in patients with refractory iron deficiency anemia secondary to small-bowel angioectasia. Combination therapy led to statistically significant reduction in transfusion requirements and bleeding episodes with an increase in hemoglobin compared with the other group.

One case series reported 3 patients with CKD and recurrent bleeding secondary to diffuse GI angiodysplasia that responded to 6 months of octreotide therapy. However, no formal studies have examined the efficacy of octreotide in treating angiodysplasia in patients with comorbid CKD.

### Successful use of long-acting octreotide for intractable chronic gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^113MG8MR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Octreotide reduces splanchnic blood flow and is effective in controlling gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) caused by portal hypertension. Monthly long-acting octreotide (OCT-LAR) with an efficacy and safety profile similar to subcutaneous daily administration presents an attractive option for long-term therapy. We report our experience with OCT-LAR for severe/recurrent GIB in children with portal hypertension secondary to chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis who were unresponsive to standard interventions.

Methods

A total of 9 patients, 7 boys, who received OCT-LAR between 2000 and 2009 were studied retrospectively (median age at first bleeding 21 months, range 1 month-14.5 years). The dose (2.5–20 mg intramuscularly monthly) was extrapolated from that used in adult acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumours (10–60 mg/mo). Response to treatment was assessed by comparing the number of bleeding events, hospital admissions for acute bleeding, and number of blood units required during the year before and year after starting OCT-LAR.

Results

OCT-LAR led to a reduction in the number of bleeding episodes in all of the children and to cessation of bleeding in 7. Two children listed for transplantation because of severe GIB were removed from the list. No serious adverse effects immediately attributable to OCT-LAR were observed. One child developed growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism during a prolonged period of treatment with subcutaneous octreotide before commencing OCT-LAR.

Conclusions

OCT-LAR can control severe intractable recurrent GIB in children with portal hypertension. Prospective randomised controlled trials and pharmacokinetic studies are indicated to establish the optimum dose and length of treatment of OCT-LAR and confirm its efficacy and long-term safety in children.

### Desensitization to the effects of intravenous octreotide in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension [^116Ti6ax]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Octreotide has been suggested for the treatment of variceal bleeding, but detailed dose-finding studies are not available. We performed a dose-finding study investigating the hemodynamic effects of several forms of intravenous octreotide administration.

Methods

Splanchnic hemodynamics and plasma glucagon levels were measured in 68 cirrhotics in baseline conditions and (1) after a double-blind intravenous injection of octreotide (50 microg [n = 9] or 500 microg [n = 8]) or placebo (n = 7); (2) after a 50-microg octreotide bolus followed by continuous infusion of 50 microg/h (n = 8), 250 microg/h (n = 8), or placebo (n = 6); (3) after repeated 50-microg injections of octreotide (n = 9) or placebo (n = 6) after an initial bolus (50 microg octreotide); and (4) after a placebo bolus and continuous octreotide infusion (50 microg/h; n = 7).

Results

Placebo caused no significant changes. Octreotide caused a marked and transient decrease in portal pressure and azygos blood flow and an increase in mean arterial pressure. These effects lasted only 5 minutes despite addition of continuous octreotide infusions. Repeated octreotide injections had shorter, less marked effects than the first bolus. A continuous octreotide infusion did not decrease portal pressure. Glucagon levels were markedly reduced by octreotide, but gradually returned to baseline despite continuous infusions or repeated injections of octreotide.

Conclusions

Octreotide injection caused marked but transient reductions in portal pressure and azygos blood flow. Adding a continuous octreotide infusion neither maintained nor prolonged its effects. Repeated boluses caused significant tachyphylaxis. This rapid desensitization to the effects of octreotide may explain the divergent effects achieved with octreotide infusions in acute variceal bleeding.

In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### Updated strategies in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage [^1134phDW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

### Octreotide for severe acute bleeding from portal hypertensive colopathy: a case report [^117R2qGv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man developed severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He was classified as Child-Pugh grade C. Colonoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia-like lesions and mucosal friability throughout the entire colon (portal hypertensive colopathy, PHC). Haemostasis was immediately achieved with octreotide treatment, although melaena recurred after discontinuation of the infusion. Propranolol treatment before discontinuation of octreotide infusin prevented the recurrence of bleeding from PHC. Octreotide is a safe and effective treatment for severe acute bleeding from PHC, especially if the patient is not a candidate for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or treatment with a beta-blocker due to the severity of liver disease or haemodynamic instability. However, a sufficient reduction of portal pressure by propranolol or other medical treatment may be needed in order to discontinue octreotide infusion without the recurrence of bleeding.

### Treatment of variceal bleeding [^114JpZQB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the most common cause of severe gastro-intestinal bleeding in childhood. Biliary atresia and portal venous obstruction are the most common causes. Each center should have a defined management protocol reflecting local practice and expertise. For patients with acute bleeding, pharmacotherapy with octreotide should be used immediately. All of these patients should undergo therapeutic endoscopy with band ligation or sclerotherapy. All children surviving variceal hemorrhage should undergo secondary prophylaxis with band ligation. No evidence supports the routine use of primary prophylaxis in children with esophageal varices.

### Long-time octreotide in an adolescent with severe haemorrhagic gastrointestinal vascular malformation [^113twQuk]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal vascular malformations are a rare cause of acute or chronic blood loss. Usually they are treated by endoscopic obliteration or surgical resection. When such a therapy is inapplicable, pharmacotherapy may be required. At the age of 15 years, our female patient suffered from transfusion dependent recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to multiple gastrointestinal vascular malformations. Gastroscopy, coloscopy and capsule endoscopy revealed numerous foci making both endoscopic obliteration and complete surgical resection impossible. Neither regular transfusions nor substitution with coagulation factors were helpful. However, subcutaneous octreotide resulted in immediate stop of bleeding. Initial treatment by daily subcutaneous injections was followed by monthly depot application. Over 3 years only 2 transfusions had to be given. The patient required thyroxin substitution, otherwise, no side effects occurred and the girl had a good quality of life. The authors conclude that octreotide is safe and effective in gastrointestinal angiodysplasias inaccessible to endoscopy or surgery.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive agents and dosing are outlined, and only one of these four agents should be used. Octreotide is given as an initial IV bolus of 50 micrograms (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous IV infusion of 50 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Vasopressin is delivered as a continuous IV infusion 0.2–0.4 U/min; can be increased to 0.8 U/min, and it should always be accompanied by IV nitroglycerin at a starting dose of 40 μg/min, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 μg/min, adjusted to maintain a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, with a duration of 24 hours. SMT (somatostatin) is given as an initial IV bolus 250 μg (can be repeated in the first hour if ongoing bleeding) and a continuous IV infusion of 250–500 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Terlipressin dosing is initial 48 hours: 2 mg IV every 4 hours until control of bleeding, then maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 hours to prevent rebleeding for 2–5 days.

### Colonic angiodysplasia: a culprit of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with Heyde syndrome [^115VSE2i]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Radionuclide scanning is the most sensitive radiographic test for GI bleeding, able to detect bleeding greater than a 0.1 mL/min. After injection of the technetium-99m pertechnetate-labelled red cells, a 60-minute dynamic scan is obtained, followed by static 2D planar images at intervals for several hours if no tracer accumulation is seen on the initial dynamic study. If bleeding is suspected on subsequent static imaging, an SPECT is performed for more accurate localisation. For these reasons, scintigraphy is useful for patients with obscure and intermittent bleeding, including those with suspected GI angiodysplasia. The 1999 AGA algorithm suggests a nuclear scan following upper and lower GI endoscopy for obscure overt GI bleeding. The disadvantage of a radionuclide scan is the inability to perform therapy, and a positive scan should be followed up shortly with angiography or colonoscopy for haemostasis. Delaying the therapeutic procedure may reduce the window for localisation and management of the lesion due to the intermittent nature of bleeding.

Various modalities have been used for treatment of bleeding angiodysplasias, including administration of octreotide or hormonal therapy, angiographic embolisation, endoscopic methods or surgical resection. Of the endoscopic techniques, argon plasma coagulation and bipolar or heater probe electrocoagulation have been best described in the literature, with argon plasma coagulation recommended as first-line endoscopic therapy. Mechanical haemostasis with endoscopic clips has not been well reported. Takahashi et al previously documented a case of successful endoscopic clipping for bleeding from colonic angiodysplasia in a case of Heyde syndrome. Aortic valve replacement has been shown to improve angiodysplastic bleeding in patients with aortic stenosis, although the angiodysplasia has been reported to persist months later.

A 2014 meta-analysis of 831 patients with angiodysplasia, including 623 patients treated via endoscopy, showed a 36% rebleeding rate at a median of 22 months from endoscopic therapy. It may, therefore, be important to follow-up these patients over the longer-term.

### Impact of timing of endoscopy on clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding: a monocentric retrospective study from Vietnam [^115ot3iS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and common medical emergency in daily clinical practice, which can lead to unpredictable consequences. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common cause of upper GI bleeding is the rupture of esophageal varices due to portal hypertension. This condition occurs when blood flow in the portal vein is obstructed by structural changes in the cirrhotic liver, resulting in elevated portal pressure and the dilation and rupture of esophageal varices. Nowadays despite advances in management, treatment, and prevention of complications in cirrhosis, the incidence of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices remains high, ranging from 20 to 40%, with a six-week mortality of 10–20%. Hence, this is a serious complication, directly threatening the patient's life if not intervened promptly. Currently, overall management of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) mainly focuses on key measures such as initial resuscitation to stabilise hemodynamics, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs to reduce portal pressure (octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin), prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopic intervention. These approaches not only control bleeding but also contribute significantly to improving long-term outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

It is undeniable that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the mainstay treatment for EVB, however, the optimal timing for endoscopy remains a topic of debate in present guidelines and research. Most existing guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline, and the Belgian guideline, suggest that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of symptom onset in cirrhotic patients with EVB. In contrast, the UK guideline recommends that in case of severe variceal bleeding and hemodynamic instability, endoscopy should be performed immediately after resuscitation. For others, it should be conducted within 24 h after hospitalisation. Meanwhile, Chinese guideline proposes that endoscopy should be conducted within 12–24 h after the presentation of variceal bleeding. Moreover, these conflicting recommendations appear to rely more on expert consensus than on solid clinical evidence.

### Long-acting octreotide reduces the recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device [^112oiwqa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most significant adverse events in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).

Methods

We enrolled LVAD patients who had received an intramuscular injection of 20mg octreotide every 4 weeks as secondary prevention for recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding despite conventional medical therapies and repeated transfusions. The frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding and other associated clinical outcomes before and during octreotide therapy were compared.

Results

Thirty LVAD patients (66.4 ± 8.8 years old, 16 men [53%]) received octreotide therapy for 498.8 ± 356.0 days without any octreotide-associated adverse events. The frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding was decreased significantly during octreotide therapy (from 3.4 ± 3.1 to 0.7 ± 1.3 events/year; P < .001), accompanied by significant reductions in red blood cell and flesh frozen plasma transfusions, days in hospital, and need for endoscopic procedures (P < .05 for all).

Conclusions

Octreotide therapy reduced the frequency of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and may be considered for secondary prevention.

### Octreotide for acute variceal bleeding [^113EjU33]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use o f octreotide for acute variceal bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were obtained through computerized searches involving MEDLINE (from 1997 to October 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing information on the diagnosis and management of acute variceal bleeding were reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection

All randomized studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used octreotide therapy for acute variceal bleeding were considered. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating variceal bleeding were also reviewed for possible inclusion.

Data Extraction

The primary outcomes extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for endoscopic intervention or balloon tamponade, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Although both endoscopic therapies and medications are used to control bleeding and rebleeding episodes, the endoscopic approach has the additional goal of obliterating the varix. Since rebleeding episodes are common as long as the varix is present, endoscopic and medication therapies cannot be considered interchangeable based on bleeding control alone. However, octreotide by continuous intravenous infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements as both an initial intervention (until definitive sclerotherapy can be performed) or as adjunctive therapy to endoscopic measures. Octreotide can be started quickly, has a relatively rapid onset of action, and does not require someone with endoscopy training to initiate. Additionally, octreotide is relatively free of significant adverse effects.

Conclusions

While additional investigations are needed, particularly in the area of pharmacoeconomics, there is substantial evidence that octreotide is an efficacious therapy with relatively few adverse effects when used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.

### Octreotide for recurrent intestinal variceal bleeding in patients without portal hypertension [^113YoEKe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report on the efficacy of octreotide acetate in two patients with intestinal phlebectasia and no evidence of portal hypertension or mesenteric thrombosis. Patient 1 was a 46-year-old woman with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. She required repeated transfusions for recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Intraoperative enteroscopy revealed wide-spread small bowel phlebectasia and intestinal resection was not performed. Blue rubber-bleb syndrome, portal hypertension and mesenteric thrombosis were ruled out. Octreotide acetate long-acting release was started. A transient interruption in treatment was followed by severe overt GIB. This was effectively controlled with continuous infusion of octreotide acetate. After this episode, octreotide acetate long-acting release was resumed and no further episodes of GIB have been reported until the most recent follow up (total duration of 74 months). Patient 2 was a 51-year-old woman with a history of recurrent GIB requiring multiple blood transfusions since young adulthood with negative endoscopic investigations. An enteroscopy showed numerous submucosal serpiginous varices in the colon and the terminal ileum. All putative causes including portal hypertension or mesenteric thrombosis were ruled out. Monthly intramuscular injections of long-acting octreotide acetate were initiated, and no GIB occurred since then (27 months of follow up). Somatostatin analogues are known to reduce splanchnic blood flow, to increase vascular resistance, to enhance platelet aggregation; and are thus efficacious in preventing GIB secondary to various vascular lesions (portal hypertension, intestinal angiodysplasia and blue rubber-bleb syndrome). These case reports suggest that they are also effective in preventing GIB in intestinal phlebactasia without portal hypertension.

### Comparison of 2 days versus 5 days of octreotide infusion along with endoscopic therapy in preventing early rebleed from esophageal varices: a randomized clinical study [^115iJVV3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Variceal bleeding is a medical emergency with 20% mortality at 6 weeks. The role of vasoactive agents in achieving hemostasis and preventing rebleeding has been well documented. The optimal duration of these agents has not been well established. There are no previous studies yielding the exact duration of octreotide to be administered to prevent rebleed and mortality from esophageal varices. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy (octreotide and endoscopy), the exact duration of octreotide infusion, its cost-effectiveness, and the outcome in terms of rebleed and mortality.

Patients and Methods

This was a randomized clinical trial including 124 patients with acute variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic therapy; they were assigned randomly to 2 days (n = 62) and 5 days (n = 58) of continuous octreotide infusion (50μg/kg). Early rebleeding (within 42 days of index bleed according to Baveno IV consensus guidelines), transfusion requirement, and mortality were assessed.

Results

The study had predominantly male patients, average age 47 years. Among the patients in the 2-day group, 3 (4.8%) showed early rebleed versus 5 (8.6%) in the 5-day group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Among the patients in the 2-day group, one patient died after 3 weeks and all the patients in the 5-day group survived till 6 weeks on follow-up, and the survival rates were comparable (P > 0.05). The treatment in the 5-day group was 2.5 times costlier than that for the 2-day group as shown by a cost-wise analysis.

Conclusion

Two days of octreotide infusion following endoscopic therapy is sufficient and as efficacious as 5 days of infusion in preventing early rebleed, with reasonably better cost-effectiveness.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive drug regimens are detailed as follows. Octreotide (somatostatin analogue): 50 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 50 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Somatostatin: 250 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 250–500 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Terlipressin (vasopressin analogue): Initial 48 h: 2 mg IV every 4 h until bleeding is controlled; Maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 h; duration 2–5 d. Although terlipressin has been evaluated for AVH and is one of the standard regimens outside of the United States, the FDA label does not include this indication.

### Systemic octreotide therapy in prevention of gastrointestinal bleeds related to arteriovenous malformations and obscure Etiology in atrial fibrillation [^114iqn4Z]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The present study describes the use of octreotide (OCT) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving oral anticoagulation (OAC) who have gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding related to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), as well as its effect on OAC tolerance and subsequent rebleeding.

Background

AVMs cause significant GI bleeding, especially in patients with AF who are receiving OAC for stroke prevention. OCT has been shown to minimize recurrent GI bleeds related to AVMs.

Methods

In a multicenter, observational study, 38 AF patients with contraindications to OAC because of AVM-related GI bleeding were started on 100 μg of subcutaneous OCT twice daily. OAC was resumed in all patients within 48 h. Incidence of recurrent GI bleeds was calculated, and hemoglobin levels were recorded at enrollment and at 3 and 6 months' follow-up.

Results

After a median follow-up of 8 months, 36 patients (mean age 69 ± 8.0 years; mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 3 ± 1 and mean HAS-BLED score 3 ± 1) were available for analysis. All were able to successfully resume OAC, and 28 of 36 (78%) remained on OAC at the conclusion of the study, whereas 8 underwent left atrial appendage closure with subsequent OAC discontinuation. No systemic thromboembolic events occurred in follow-up. Of the 28 patients who continued receiving OAC, 19 (68%) were free of recurrent GI bleed, 4 had minor GI bleeds, 4 required transfusion, and 1 required colectomy for GI bleeding. Mean hemoglobin levels in all patients receiving OAC were significantly higher at 3- and 6-month follow-up than at baseline (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Subcutaneous OCT therapy is an attractive option in AF patients receiving OAC who have AVM-related GI bleeds. It allows successful reinitiation of OAC as a bridge to left atrial appendage exclusion or short-term relief from bleeding.

RX (Treatment)

We recommend intravenous terlipressin is given to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding. However, caution should be exercised in patients with ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease

Level of evidence: High

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous terlipressin 2 mg four times a day in case of suspected variceal bleeding (80% agreement)

Variceal bleeding should be suspected in patients presenting with AUGIB who have known cirrhosis or have clinical parameters that would suggest cirrhosis. The UK variceal bleed guidelines recommend administering terlipressin or somatostatin as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, for up to 5 days or until attainment of haemostasis, with octreotide as an alternative. The efficacy of intravenous terlipressin in variceal bleeding has been presented in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 1609). Seven studies (n = 443) compared terlipressin to placebo, of which five were considered to be high quality. This showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (34% relative risk reduction), improved haemostasis and reduced transfusion requirement. Similar results were found in an updated meta-analysis in 2012. A more recent multicentre RCT (n = 780) reported non-inferiority of terlipressin compared with octreotide and somatostatin, with no difference in outcomes of haemorrhage control, rebleeding and mortality. The BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle suggests caution in patients with known ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and mandatory ECG assessment in patients aged over 65 years.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114xJH5Z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs alongside endoscopic management in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) varies, with multiple societies recommending a broad range of 2–5 days. Earlier studies found a 5-day duration compared to placebo alongside endoscopic therapy effective in preventing EVB, but a subsequent study showed that a 2-day duration doubled treatment failures. Since then, data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing shorter and longer durations of vasoactive drug durations have been pooled in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs). These demonstrated similar rates of 5-day variceal rebleeding with shortened durations, approximating the 2-day vasoactive drug duration, compared to longer durations, leading the European Association for the Study of the Liver to suggest that a shortened duration should be considered.

Neither of these SRMAs compared the outcomes of short vs. longer courses across a single vasoactive drug, and only 1 SRMA included a single study on octreotide, the vasoactive drug of choice due efficacy and safety, relative to terlipressin. Terlipressin, however, has recently gained approval for hepatorenal syndrome in the United States, which may increase its popularity and, while several relevant RCTs have been pooled for meta-analysis, newer published RCTs with updated management are available in addition to published RCTs on somatostatin.

Our updated SRMA aimed to add data to variceal rebleeding at 5 days, but also to pool data from multiple studies on rebleeding and mortality at time points within approximately 6 weeks, as recommended by portal hypertension guidelines. It was designed to assess each vasoactive drug individually, to determine any differences between drugs over shorter durations. Additionally, the study assessed whether the effect on EVB of shortening the duration of vasoactive drug therapy was influenced by the endoscopic technique of sclerotherapy vs. band ligation (BL), the standard of care. Finally, Child-Pugh Class C (CPCC) has been cited as a significant predictor of variceal rebleeding, with prior RCTs focusing on higher CPCC distributions. We sought to add studies across various distributions of CPCC to explore the effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations in various severities of liver disease.

### Octreotide for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^115gkiZN]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Studies of octreotide have not demonstrated a consistent benefit in efficacy or safety compared with conventional therapies. This study statistically pooled existing trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide for esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

Methods

We identified randomized trials of octreotide for variceal hemorrhage from computerized databases, scientific meeting abstracts, and the manufacturer of octreotide. Blinded reviewers abstracted the data, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Octreotide improved control of esophageal variceal hemorrhage compared with all alternative therapies combined (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.77); vasopressin/terlipressin (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.81); or no additional intervention/placebo (among patients that received initial sclerotherapy/banding before randomization) (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67). Octreotide had comparable efficacy to immediate sclerotherapy for control of bleeding (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.55–1.62), fewer major complications than vasopressin/terlipessin (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.87), and a complication profile comparable to no intervention/placebo (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72–1.55). No specific alternative therapy demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Conclusions

These results favor octreotide over vasopressin/terlipressin in the control of esophageal variceal bleeding and suggest it is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration techniques. Trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of octreotide treatment.

### Successful control of massive gastrointestinal bleeding following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) by use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and octreotide infusion [^117PLph5]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a dreaded complication. There are only five other reports (one randomised trial and four case reports) of use of rFVIIa for massive lower GI bleeding post-allogeneic HSCT. In only one publication, two adult patients showed complete response. Eroglu has reported a response rate of 50% to octreotide in gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without portal hypertension. We present a 10 month-old female child, who had three episodes of life threatening lower GI bleeding post unrelated Umbilical Stem Cell Transplant (UCBT) controlled successfully each time by use of rFVIIa and octreotide infusion and review of literature. To our knowledge this is the first and youngest case reported, in which both rFVIIa and octreotide have been used successfully to control life threatening lower GI bleeding post UCBT.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

Gastrointestinal bleeding

How should gastrointestinal bleeding be managed in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Patients with DC with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should receive ceftriaxone and a vasoactive agent (vasopressin, somatostatin, or octreotide). Ventilated patients with upper GIB (UGIB) should receive a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Viscoelastic testing (VET) can guide use of VTE prophylaxis. Transfusion should be performed with goal hemoglobin (Hb) of 7–8 g/dL (70–80 g/L). Endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours and TIPS should be considered for recurrent or persistent variceal bleeding.

Discussion

Variceal hemorrhage is one of several disease-defining clinical features of DC. In the critically ill trauma or surgical patient presenting to the hospital for a separate indication, DC due to GIB results in a compounding of morbidity and mortality. The most common etiology of GIB in DC is portal hypertension, and spontaneously resolves in only 50% of cases. Failure of combination pharmacological therapy and endoscopy may occur in up to 20%, requiring advanced methods of hemostasis.

Ceftriaxone (1 g intravenous daily) reduces infectious complications, re-bleeding, and mortality in patients with UGIB, regardless of whether it is variceal or non-variceal. The duration of treatment is 7 days but discontinuation can be considered once hemorrhage has resolved and vasoactive drugs have been discontinued.

Mechanically ventilated patients receiving PPI rather than H₂ receptor blockade for prophylaxis experience fewer episodes of clinically important UGIB. Although this effect has not been specifically evaluated for prevention of variceal UGIB, both the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend PPI for patients with cirrhosis requiring mechanical ventilation and suggest a possible benefit of PPI in reducing ulceration size following endoscopic band ligation. If not already initiated as prophylaxis, PPI therapy should be started to reduce recurrence for non-variceal GIB. While chemical VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to provoke GIB, patients with DC with recent GIB may be poor candidates for this, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia (< 50×10⁹/L). However, the coagulation profile of patients with DC as a predictor of bleeding risk is poorly understood and potentially better evaluated by VET over traditional assays. In blood product administration, there is no known benefit to achieving a higher Hb through transfusion in patients with DC as compared with balanced resuscitation with a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy (Hb of 7–8 g/dL).

In terms of trends, prior to the sensitivity analysis there were statistically insignificant trends towards increased rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality in the longer vasoactive duration group who underwent BL. Octreotide and somatostatin both had similar trends of increased rebleeding within 5 days associated with the longer treatment durations (Fig. 2A), with only 1 study pooled on each, whereas shortening terlipressin had no notable trend and more studies were pooled. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for all 14 studies, which revealed that 11 studies had some risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis, excluding studies with high CPCC distributions, revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations in patients who underwent BL. Conversely, including only studies with high-risk variceal features or high CPCC distribution revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding and a trend towards greater mortality due to rebleeding at the EP.

### Bleeding caused by portal hypertension [^115fkhB2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the dreaded complications of portal hypertension. Patients who have suspected or proven cirrhosis should undergo diagnostic upper endoscopy to detect medium and large gastro-esophageal varices. Patients with medium and large gastro-esophageal varices should be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol), and these agents should be titrated to a heart rate of 55 beats per minute or adverse effects. If there are contraindications to or if patients are intolerant to beta-blockers, it is appropriate to consider prophylactic banding therapy for individuals with medium-to-large esophageal varices. When patients who have cirrhosis present with GI bleeding, they should be resuscitated and receive octreotide or other vasoactive agents. Endoscopy should be performed promptly to diagnose the source of bleeding and to provide endoscopic therapy (preferably banding). The currently available treatment for acute variceal bleeding provides hemostasis in most patients. These patients, however, are at significant risk for rebleeding unless secondary prophylaxis is provided. Although various pharmacological, endoscopic, radiological, and surgical options are available, combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy is the most common form of secondary prophylaxis. TIPS is a radiologically placed portasystemic shunt, and if placed in suitable patients, it can provide effective treatment for patients with variceal bleeding that is refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

The combination of vasoactive agents with endoscopic treatment is more effective for hemostasis than using either alone. Vasoactive agents (ie, vasopressin, somatostatin or octreotide) should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected with a bolus (only somatostatin, octreotide) followed by continuous infusion (all agents) for duration 3–5 days, except vasopressin which should only be given for 24 hours. Consider infusion of erythromycin (250 mg given over 20–30 min) or metoclopramide as a promotility agent prior to endoscopy to clear gastric contents and assist with visualization.

Patients with UGIB in the setting of DC should be considered for endoscopy within 12 hours. Balloon tamponade as a bridge to TIPS should be considered as rescue therapy for patients with refractory variceal UGIB.

Background & Aims

Recent reductions in mortality after acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage among patients with cirrhosis have been attributed to early and aggressive use of guideline-recommended pharmacologic agents, antibiotics, and endoscopic therapy. Studies have shown, however, that adherence to recommended guidelines is low. We investigated whether use of a standardized electronic order set would improve adherence to treatment and timeliness of delivery.

We performed a prospective observational study, implementing an electronic order set for 123 patients with known or suspected cirrhosis who presented with symptoms/signs of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at Parkland Memorial Hospital (in Dallas, TX) from July 2011 through June 2012. The order set included standard nursing orders, laboratory tests, medications, orders for consultative services, and a brief evidence-based review of the benefits of octreotide and antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis. Primary outcomes included overall adherence to the administration of octreotide and antibiotics and the performance of upper endoscopy, as well as time to these interventions.

Results

Administration of antibiotics increased in patients for whom the order set was used (100% vs 89% for whom it was not used; p = 0.01); the use of the order set significantly reduced the time to administration of antibiotics (3 h 28 min vs 10 h 4 min; P < .001). The time to administration of octreotide also significantly was reduced for patients for whom the order set was used (2 h 16 min vs 6 h 21 min; P < .002). Although all patients underwent endoscopy, there was no significant difference in the time to procedure between patients for whom the order set was used and not used (17 h 54 min vs 18 h 5 min; p = 0.95).

Conclusions

The use of a standardized electronic order set improved not only overall adherence, but also the timeliness of administration of recommended therapies for patients with known or suspected cirrhosis presenting with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yJm1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, our subgroup analysis revealed that a shorter duration of vasoactive therapy combined with sclerotherapy was associated with more rebleeding and greater mortality in the extended period (EP). This makes intuitive sense, as sclerotherapy has been associated with acute rises in portal pressures lasting for 5 days, which may increase rebleeding risk; thus, longer vasoactive durations for up to 5 days to potentially counteract that effect should remain the standard of care whenever sclerotherapy is performed.

Finally, our sensitivity analysis by liver disease and variceal bleeding severity showed a trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer vasoactive durations in cases with less severity, and a trend for less 5-day rebleeding and lower mortality at the EP associated with longer durations in cases with higher severity. The trend that shortening durations alongside BL decreases rebleeding in patients with less severe bleeding, particularly with octreotide and somatostatin, but increases rebleeding in severe liver disease or variceal bleeding cases, warrants a cautious approach to shortening vasoactive durations in severe EVB, pending further investigation. It should be noted that the lower levels of rebleeding in shorter durations were more prevalent in the octreotide and somatostatin subgroups, which share similar mechanisms of action. Data suggest that longer durations of octreotide lead to tachyphylaxis and less sustained drops in portal pressures compared to terlipressin, although how this relates back to greater rebleeding is unclear. Additionally, the trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations of octreotide/somatostatin, but not terlipressin, could just be due to the limited sample size for the former drugs.

### Initial assessment and management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114VZvT6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a substantial clinical and economic burden, with an estimated mortality rate between 3% and 15%. The initial management starts with hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation. Blood transfusions may be needed in patients with low hemoglobin levels or massive bleeding, and patients who are anticoagulated may require administration of fresh frozen plasma. Patients with significant bleeding should be started on a proton-pump inhibitor infusion, and if there is concern for variceal bleeding, an octreotide infusion. Patients with UGIB should be stratified into low-risk and high-risk categories using validated risk scores. The use of these risk scores can aid in separating low-risk patients who are suitable for outpatient management or early discharge following endoscopy from patients who are at increased risk for needing endoscopic intervention, rebleeding, and death. Upper endoscopy after adequate resuscitation is required for most patients and should be performed within 24 hours of presentation. Key to improving outcomes is appropriate initial management of patients presenting with UGIB.

10 OVERDOSAGE

A limited number of accidental overdoses of Octreotide Acetate Injection in adults have been reported. In adults, the doses ranged from 2,400 to 6,000 mcg/day administered by continuous infusion (100 to 250 mcg/hour) or subcutaneously (1,500 mcg 3 times a day). Adverse events in some patients included arrhythmia, complete atrioventricular block, hypotension, cardiac arrest, brain hypoxia, pancreatitis, hepatitis steatosis, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, flushing, diarrhea, lethargy, weakness, and weight loss.

If overdose occurs, symptomatic management is indicated. Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can often be obtained from the National Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222.
