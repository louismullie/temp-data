## Question

Causes for elevated urobilirubin, urobilinogen, and protein in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of elevated urine bilirubin, urobilinogen, and protein on urinalysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of bilirubin and urobilinogen handling to anchor the differential. Then, I should verify the common etiologies for each abnormality and how they overlap. Next, I will consider special populations and confounders that can mislead interpretation. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise diagnostic approach and confirmatory testing. Finally, I will synthesize the key takeaways and highlight red flags that warrant urgent action, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Urine bilirubin is conjugated (direct) bilirubin that appears when hepatic excretion is impaired or overwhelmed, whereas urobilinogen reflects enteric bacterial reduction of bilirubin and subsequent enterohepatic cycling; normally most urobilinogen is reabsorbed and excreted in stool, with only a small amount in urine, so increased urine urobilinogen suggests increased bilirubin load or altered enterohepatic dynamics, and proteinuria reflects increased glomerular permeability or tubular dysfunction, which are mechanistically distinct but can coexist in systemic disease states [^6b3a8ffd] [^b2dd9331] [^2a55fd77].

> Now, for elevated urine bilirubin, I should confirm the classic causes. Hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and biliary obstruction reduce bilirubin excretion and drive conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with urinary bilirubin, so I need to check liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and consider imaging if obstruction is suspected; importantly, dipstick bilirubin can be falsely positive, so I should verify with a more specific method if the clinical picture doesn't fit [^6b3a8ffd] [^5d6ad67a]. Wait, let me verify drug effects: atazanavir inhibits UGT and causes indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which would not be expected to increase urine bilirubin, so if I see urine bilirubin with atazanavir I should reconsider the test or look for concurrent hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis [^8e2b2a5b].

> For elevated urine urobilinogen, I need to ensure I separate increased production from increased enterohepatic recycling. Hemolysis increases bilirubin load and thus urobilinogen, while hepatocellular disease with impaired conjugation or shunting can increase urobilinogen in urine; I should double-check for hemolysis with haptoglobin, LDH, and a peripheral smear when hemolysis is on the table [^6b3a8ffd] [^6a130be4]. Hold on, I should verify that a very high urobilinogen with low or absent urine bilirubin supports hemolysis rather than cholestasis, which aligns with the physiology of unconjugated bilirubin not being filtered [^notfound].

> For proteinuria, I should confirm the major buckets and not over-attribute to bilirubin-related processes. Glomerular causes include diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritides, and systemic diseases like amyloidosis; tubular causes include ATN, interstitial nephritis, and overflow proteins such as light chains; transient proteinuria can follow exercise, fever, or orthostasis, so I need to repeat testing before labeling chronic kidney disease [^6a36aee8] [^f1ca73e2] [^824fb5ea]. I should double-check that dipstick protein is only semi-quantitative and can miss nonalbumin proteins, so confirmatory ACR or PCR and, when indicated, specific assays for tubular proteins or free light chains are prudent [^09b07017] [^65a417ee].

> But wait, what if multiple abnormalities coexist; I need to check for overlapping etiologies. Severe hepatobiliary disease can simultaneously cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with urine bilirubin, increased urobilinogen from impaired conjugation or shunting, and proteinuria from hepatorenal syndrome or cholemic nephropathy; in such cases, urine chemistries, microscopy, and renal imaging help distinguish functional from structural kidney injury [^577352c8] [^c416dae2]. I should confirm that cholemic nephropathy is associated with highly elevated bilirubin and tubular injury, which ties bilirubin handling to proteinuria in that specific context [^c416dae2].

> Next, I should review special populations and confounders so I don't misinterpret results. In infants, jaundice can be the first sign of UTI, so I need to check urinalysis and culture when jaundice appears after day 8 or when conjugated bilirubin is elevated; in pregnancy, new proteinuria raises concern for preeclampsia and should be quantified and integrated with blood pressure and organ involvement markers; in older adults, sarcopenia lowers creatinine excretion and can artifactually elevate ACR, so I should interpret ratios cautiously and consider timed collections when needed [^f3d27b6e] [^a7d9d51c] [^bc8ca516]. Hold on, I should verify that COVID-19 frequently causes proteinuria and hematuria, reflecting diverse kidney injuries, so in that context proteinuria may signal higher AKI risk even outside classic hepatobiliary disease [^bdafe71b] [^133dbac1].

> I will now examine a practical diagnostic approach, but let me first confirm the basics. Repeat urinalysis to exclude transient causes, obtain liver chemistries with fractionated bilirubin, CBC and smear for hemolysis, and quantify proteinuria with ACR or PCR; if proteinuria is significant or persistent, add renal function tests, electrolytes, and consider serologies and imaging based on suspected etiology; if obstruction or cholestasis is suspected, obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound and, when appropriate, MRCP or ERCP [^6a36aee8] [^f1ca73e2] [^6b3a8ffd]. I should double-check that in cirrhosis with AKI, distinguishing HRS-AKI from ATN or prerenal azotemia guides therapy, so urine sodium, urea, and microscopy are essential adjuncts [^577352c8].

> Let me reconsider confirmatory testing nuances so I don't overstate dipstick results. If I suspect nonalbumin proteinuria or light chain disease, I should order a urine protein electrophoresis or free light chains; if I suspect tubular proteinuria, I should request α1-microglobulin or β2-microglobulin; and if I need precise quantification, a 24-hour collection remains useful, especially in pregnancy or when ACR is unreliable due to low muscle mass [^09b07017] [^65a417ee]. I need to ensure I account for biological variability by repeating unexpected abnormalities before diagnosing CKD, as recommended by KDIGO [^f1ca73e2] [^824fb5ea].

> Finally, I should synthesize the key takeaways and make sure I'm not missing red flags. Elevated urine bilirubin points to hepatobiliary disease or impaired conjugation, elevated urobilinogen suggests hemolysis or hepatocellular dysfunction, and proteinuria signals glomerular or tubular kidney disease; their coexistence should prompt evaluation for systemic processes like severe liver disease, sepsis, or multiorgan involvement, and any new proteinuria deserves confirmation and staging to guide prognosis and therapy [^6b3a8ffd] [^6a36aee8]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent proteinuria with hematuria, hypertension, or systemic symptoms warrants expedited nephrology referral, whereas isolated mild abnormalities may be observed with repeat testing and targeted labs, aligning with guideline-based risk stratification [^6a36aee8] [^f1ca73e2].

---

Elevated urine bilirubin and urobilinogen reflect **hepatobiliary disease** [^6b3a8ffd] or **hemolysis** [^6a130be4], while proteinuria indicates **renal pathology** [^6a36aee8] (glomerular or tubular) or transient causes (fever, exercise, dehydration) [^f1ca73e2]. Concurrent findings suggest **systemic disease** (e.g. hepatitis, cirrhosis, hemolytic disorders, or sepsis) [^6f6b7c38] or **multisystem involvement** (e.g. lupus, diabetes, or COVID-19) [^bdafe71b]. Confirm with **repeat urinalysis** [^f1ca73e2], liver enzymes, bilirubin fractions, CBC, and renal function tests [^6a36aee8]; quantify proteinuria with ACR/PCR [^d7b306f2] and pursue imaging or biopsy if indicated [^6a36aee8].

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

### Elevated urine bilirubin and urobilinogen

- **Bilirubin metabolism**: Bilirubin is a byproduct of heme breakdown. Unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble and not filtered by the glomerulus, whereas conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and excreted in urine when hepatobiliary excretion is impaired [^6a130be4].

- **Urobilinogen formation**: Urobilinogen is formed in the gut by bacterial reduction of bilirubin. Most is excreted in feces, but a portion is reabsorbed and excreted in urine. Increased urine urobilinogen occurs with increased bilirubin production (e.g. hemolysis) or impaired hepatic processing (e.g. hepatocellular disease) [^b2dd9331].

- **Clinical significance**: Elevated urine bilirubin and urobilinogen indicate hepatobiliary disease (e.g. hepatitis, cirrhosis, biliary obstruction) [^6a130be4] or hemolytic disorders [^6a130be4].

---

### Elevated urine protein

- **Normal protein excretion**: Normally, < 150 mg/day of protein is excreted in urine, primarily albumin. Increased protein excretion indicates increased glomerular permeability or impaired tubular reabsorption [^notfound].

- **Clinical significance**: Proteinuria is a hallmark of renal disease (e.g. glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy) [^6a36aee8] but can also occur transiently with fever, exercise, dehydration, or urinary tract infection [^f1ca73e2].

| **Category** | **Conditions** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Hepatobiliary diseases | - Hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Biliary obstruction <br/> - Cholestasis | - Impaired bilirubin conjugation and excretion <br/> - Increased urobilinogen production <br/> - Associated renal involvement (e.g. hepatorenal syndrome) [^577352c8] |
| Hemolytic disorders | - Hemolytic anemia <br/> - Sickle cell disease <br/> - G6PD deficiency <br/> - Autoimmune hemolysis | - Increased bilirubin production <br/> - Increased urobilinogen formation <br/> - Hemoglobinuria causing proteinuria [^notfound] |

| Medications and toxins | - Statins <br/> - Acetaminophen overdose <br/> - Antibiotics (e.g. rifampin) <br/> - Chemotherapeutic agents | - Hepatotoxicity causing bilirubin elevation <br/> - Nephrotoxicity causing proteinuria [^ec924722] |
| Transient causes | - Fever <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Urinary tract infection | - Transient proteinuria <br/> - Minimal bilirubin/urobilinogen elevation [^f1ca73e2] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat urinalysis to confirm persistent abnormalities and exclude transient causes [^f1ca73e2].

- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin to assess hepatobiliary function [^6a130be4].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, and electrolytes to assess renal function [^6a36aee8].

- **Complete blood count**: Evaluate for anemia, hemolysis, or infection [^notfound].

---

### Quantification and characterization

Quantify proteinuria with a **spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)** or **protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR)** [^d7b306f2], and use a **24-hour urine collection** when accurate quantification is needed or in special populations (e.g. pregnancy) [^53f5c778]. Assess urine microscopy for cells, casts, and crystals to help distinguish glomerular from tubular disease [^6a36aee8].

---

### Further investigations

Use **imaging** — ultrasound or CT — to evaluate for hepatobiliary obstruction, liver lesions, or renal structural abnormalities [^6a36aee8]. Consider serologic testing for hepatitis B/C, autoimmune markers (ANA, ANCA), and HIV when clinically indicated. Pursue **renal biopsy** for unexplained persistent proteinuria or suspected glomerulonephritis [^6a36aee8].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Severity indicator**: Combined elevation of bilirubin, urobilinogen, and protein in urine indicates significant hepatobiliary and renal involvement, often reflecting systemic disease or multisystem organ dysfunction [^c416dae2].

- **Urgent evaluation**: Prompt recognition and evaluation are essential to identify underlying causes and prevent progression of liver and kidney disease [^6a36aee8].

- **Management**: Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause (e.g. hepatitis treatment, removal of obstructing lesions, immunosuppression for autoimmune diseases, discontinuation of nephrotoxic/hepatotoxic drugs) [^6a36aee8].

---

Elevated urine bilirubin, urobilinogen, and protein indicate concurrent hepatobiliary and renal involvement, often due to systemic disease or multisystem organ dysfunction. A structured diagnostic approach — confirmatory testing, liver and renal function assessment, quantification of proteinuria, and targeted imaging or biopsy — is essential to identify the cause and guide management [^6a36aee8].

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^6b3a8ffd]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^2aa09b1f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Can urine dipstick predict an elevated serum creatinine? [^cb184901]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Chart review studies have suggested that point-of-care urine dipstick testing may accurately predict an elevation in serum creatinine (Cr). We aimed to prospectively evaluate the test characteristics of proteinuria/hematuria in predicting elevated serum Cr.

Methods

A prospective, observational study was conducted between March 2007 and June 2008 at 2 affiliated, urban hospitals with an annual emergency department census of 150,000. Patients undergoing laboratory urinalysis, point-of-care urine dipstick, and a serum chemistry panel were enrolled. Trained research assistants collected data on consecutive patients 18 hours per day using preformatted data forms and entry into an anonymized Access (Microsoft, Seattle, Wash) database. Demographic baseline variables including age, sex, chief complaint, vital signs, and source of sample (catheter vs "clean catch") were also collected. An elevated Cr level was defined as greater than 1.3 based on the laboratory reference range. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate diagnostic test operating characteristics of proteinuria or hematuria as a predictor of elevated serum Cr.

Results

Five thousand four hundred sixteen subjects were enrolled with 28.3% male and a mean age of 50.2 years. Elevated serum Cr greater than 1.3 mg/dL was found in 13.9% (755/5416) of subjects. The sensitivity of either proteinuria or hematuria for elevated Cr was 82.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80%-85%) and specificity was 34.4% (95% CI, 33%-36%). Positive predictive value was 16.9% (95% CI, 16%-18%) and negative predictive value was 92.4% (95% CI, 91–94%). The likelihood ratio for a positive test was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5), and the likelihood ratio for a negative test was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3–0.8).

Conclusions

Although negative predictive value was high, the presence of proteinuria/hematuria was only moderately predictive of elevated serum Cr level.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^5ed683c9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy defined by the new onset of hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria and/or signs of maternal organ dysfunction. It complicates approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies and is responsible for at least 17% of maternal deaths worldwide. PE may progress to multiorgan failure and maternal mortality, and it is a major contributor to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to compromised placental perfusion and preterm delivery. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain incompletely elucidated.

Due to its involvement in diverse pathological pathways and its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, PE is frequently described as a "disease of theories". The clinical course of PE can deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably, and currently, the only definitive treatment is delivery. The potential for life-threatening complications — such as acute renal injury, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological, cardiac, or hematologic involvement — has intensified efforts to enhance early diagnosis and risk prediction. Nevertheless, existing predictive tools remain suboptimal. A 2024 study reported a predictive accuracy of only 41% for term PE at a 10% false-positive rate, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic strategies. Consequently, ongoing research continues to seek improvements in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of PE.

The pathophysiology of PE is characterized by abnormal placental perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent cellular injury. This injury is commonly associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a well-established marker of cellular damage. Hemolysis is also a prominent feature, resulting in erythrocyte destruction and the release of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is enzymatically degraded by heme oxygenase (HO) into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. While bilirubin possesses notable antioxidant properties, it may exert cytotoxic effects when present at elevated concentrations. In the circulation, bilirubin binds tightly to albumin and is transported to the liver, where it undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, increasing its solubility and facilitating biliary excretion. Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin typically reflect hemolysis or impaired hepatic conjugation, whereas increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin suggests biliary obstruction or impaired hepatic excretory function.

### Rosuvastatin (Crestor) [^ec924722]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of CRESTOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with CRESTOR. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including CRESTOR.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before CRESTOR initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue CRESTOR.

5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria

In the CRESTOR clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among CRESTOR treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of CRESTOR or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on CRESTOR therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing.

5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including CRESTOR. Based on clinical trial data with CRESTOR, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.

KDIGO 2024 CKD guideline — Practice Point 1.1.1.2 on confirmatory testing after incidental findings states: "Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD". It adds that "there is known biological and analytical variability in SCr and in urine albumin or urine protein", that "any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD", that "subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required", and that "timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD". "Hematuria is common and associated with risk for subsequent development of CKD".

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^0d23d712]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Reduced eGFR and abnormal proteinuria have been associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. Because renal disease often progresses to ESRD, the identification of risk factors for kidney disease progression is essential.

Increased concentrations of serum bilirubin have long been used as a marker of liver dysfunction. In addition, serum bilirubin is not merely an end product of heme degradation but is also a potent antioxidant that acts via inhibitions of NADPH oxidase, a key source of oxidants in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, and of protein kinase C activity.

Information on the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with renal function and proteinuria is limited and controversial. Fukui et al. found that total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with albuminuria in a hospital-based sample of 633 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, indicating that bilirubin has a potential renoprotective effect. In contrast, Targher et al. found that a higher total serum bilirubin was significantly associated with lower eGFR in both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals in a group of 2678 unselected outpatients 35 years of age or older.

To date, the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with kidney function and proteinuria have not been established in a Korean adult population. Therefore, we examined the associations among serum bilirubin concentration, eGFR and the degree of 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Cholemic nephropathy causes acute kidney injury and is accompanied by loss of aquaporin 2 in collecting ducts [^c416dae2]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Impairment of renal function often occurs in patients with liver disease. Hepatorenal syndrome is a significant cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with cirrhosis (HRS-AKI, type 1). Causes of non-HRS-AKI include cholemic nephropathy (CN), a disease that is characterized by intratubular bile casts and tubular injury. As data on patients with CN are obtained primarily from case reports or autopsy studies, we aimed to investigate the frequency and clinical course of CN. We identified 149 patients who underwent kidney biopsy between 2000 and 2016 at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School. Of these, 79 had a history of liver disease and deterioration of renal function. When applying recent European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, 45 of 79 patients (57%) presented with AKI, whereas 34 patients (43%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal biopsy revealed the diagnosis of CN in 8 of 45 patients with AKI (17.8%), whereas none of the patients with CKD was diagnosed with CN. Univariate analysis identified serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and urinary bilirubin and urobilinogen as predictive factors for the diagnosis of CN. Histological analysis of AKI patients with normal bilirubin, elevated bilirubin, and the diagnosis of CN revealed loss of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) expression in collecting ducts in patients with elevated bilirubin and CN. Biopsy-related complications requiring medical intervention occurred in 4 of 79 patients (5.1%). Conclusion: CN is a common finding in patients with liver disease, AKI, and highly elevated bilirubin. Loss of AQP2 in AKI patients with elevated bilirubin and CN might be the result of toxic effects of cholestasis and in part be responsible for the impairment of renal function.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^f1ca73e2]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — Table 16 factors causing biological variation in urine albumin or urine protein identifies causes of falsely elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and causes of false decreases. Hematuria, menstruation, and exercise increase albumin and protein in the urine, symptomatic urinary infection can cause production of protein from the organism, and for nonalbumin proteins other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration modifies ACR and PCR: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion, therefore higher ACR and PCR, while males have higher urinary creatinine excretion, therefore lower ACR and PCR; low urinary creatinine excretion consistent with low weight can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, while high urinary creatinine excretion consistent with high weight can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower urinary creatinine excretion with AKI or low-protein intake contrasts with high urinary creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise.

When participants were stratified into categories based on proteinuria (Table 3), persons with higher proteinuria were hypoalbuminemic, more likely to be male, hypercholesterolemic (although level of LDL was similar) and had lower values of total bilirubin compared with those of patients with normal proteinuria.

When participants were stratified into categories based on fasting blood glucose (Table 4), diabetic patients were hypoalbuminuric compared with non-diabetic patients. No significant differences were found with regard to serum total bilirubin concentration between participants with normal and abnormal fasting blood glucose levels.

Practice Point 1.1.1.2 — repeat testing after incidental abnormal findings: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD. There is known biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine (SCr) and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to their properties as markers of kidney disease. In people without risk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD and any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the person does have CKD even with an unexpected finding, and subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^f7cee366]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) clinical judgment and pseudo-AKI — definitions provide a framework but should not replace or exclude clinical judgment; AKI remains a clinical diagnosis and exceptions where definition-fit should not be labeled AKI are very rare. Pseudo-AKI considerations include repeating suspicious laboratory values and recognizing that the coefficient of variation for SCr is very small (< 5%) by testing methods, yet inter-laboratory bias may be higher (unlikely to approach 50%); differences in diet and activity may be as great as 10%; and endogenous chromogens and drugs (e.g., bilirubin, ascorbic acid, uric acid; cephalosporins, trimethoprim, cimetidine) may interfere with the creatinine assay. A weight-based urine output criterion may also mean some very obese patients fulfill the definition without kidney abnormality.

Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and reagent strip protein testing — limitations and confirmatory strategy: Tests for total urine protein cannot substitute for tests for urine albumin, and PCR is less sensitive than ACR, so even negative tests must be confirmed by tests for albumin; increased PCR suggests increased ACR but nonalbumin protein can cause a positive test, so positive tests should be confirmed by tests for albumin. Patients with elevated PCR and negative tests for albumin may have tubular proteinuria, light chain proteinuria or urinary tract disease, and specific assays are available for α1-microglobulin, β2 microglobulin, monoclonal heavy or light chains. Reagent strips allow point-of-care, semi-quantitative assessment of total urine protein concentration.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue rosuvastatin if IMNM is suspected.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of rosuvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with rosuvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before rosuvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin.

5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria

In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on rosuvastatin therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing.

### Strategy and rationale for urine collection protocols employed in the NEPTUNE study [^513a5923]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

NEPTUNE urine collection protocol

A defined urine collection procedure (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1; and Additional Methods-Manuals of Procedures for Spot Urine and for 24-h Urine Processing) was created based upon best practices and literature review. This approach was employed to provide a standardized collection procedure applied to all participating centers. Samples are collected using two working protocols: (1) from 24-h whole urine collection, and (2) spot urine collections (recorded as "am" or "pm" void). A total of 13 visits are planned for the anticipated 600 participants in the study. In each visit, a total of 11 tubes will be generated: three 5 mL tubes (n = 4 times), seven 2 mL tubes (n = 12), and one 50 mL tube (n = 2). In other words, a total of 121 samples will be generated per participant over 13 visits. To date, about 400 participants have been enrolled in the study. We anticipate there will be up to 72,600 urine samples collected through the study timeframe.

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^867087cd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the 3 total serum bilirubin ranges.

Results

Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the 3 total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < .0001). There was no significant trend in comparable sensitivity values (0.380, 0.417, and 0.241, respectively) with P = 0.55. The false-positive proportion also increased as a function of total serum bilirubin (17.5%, 17.3%, and 72.0%) with P < .0001. Thus, if a patient's total serum bilirubin was elevated to the point of jaundice (> 3.0 mg/dL), it was approximately 4 times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive" (ie, nitrite-positive/culture-negative) compared with those with normal serum bilirubin levels.

Conclusions

Specificity of the urine nitrite test for urinary tract infection decreases as a function of increasing serum bilirubin. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a positive nitrite test in our sample did not have an associated urinary tract infection.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^2a55fd77]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^15b213b6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Are unexpected positive dipstick urine bilirubin results clinically significant? A retrospective review [^5d6ad67a]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urine-bilirubin measurement is common in urinalysis dipsticks, which are known to yield a high rate of false positive results. We evaluated the usefulness of this test after multiple physicians in our system reported that they do not act on positive dipstick urine bilirubin findings.

Methods

We queried past records to determine how many samples with positive urine bilirubin results had associated abnormal results for liver function tests (LFTs) within 2 weeks before the positive urine bilirubin result. (LFTs included aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and total bilirubin.) We labeled positive results on these test as expected positives. We labeled the positive test results for samples from patients who had not had abnormal LFT results within 2 weeks before the current testing as unexpected positives.

Results

During a 20-month period, we performed 241,929 urine-bilirubin tests. Of these, 831 (0.3%) yielded positive results. Of these positives, 60% were from patients who had abnormal LFT results in the previous 2 weeks. The remaining 40% of positive results were deemed to be unexpected positives. Of these, 80% had had LFTs ordered within 2 weeks after the positive urine bilirubin results. A total of 85% of those LFTs yielded an abnormal result.

Conclusion

In patients with an unexpected positive urine bilirubin test result, 85% had abnormal LFT results after their positive urine bilirubin result. However, these unexpected positives amounted to only 0.13% of all test results. Urine bilirubin does not appear to add significant information toward the diagnosis of most patients.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^d40cfa4e]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional design, which allows us to identify only associations and should not yield any conclusions about causation. In addition, results of this study may not be applicable to the general population or to patients with type 2 diabetes in a primary care clinic because the data were collected from patients in an outpatient clinic of a university hospital. This study's results are not definitive because a Pearson's correlation coefficient of less than ± 0.25 is generally considered to be a weak correlation. We think prompt further research into this interesting correlation will be needed. Second, we were unable to explain the reason why both the non-diabetic and diabetic group had the same results. Third, liver ultrasonography for diagnosing NAFLD was not performed. Finally, we used eGFR instead of a directly measured GFR to assess renal function. It is known that current eGFR experiences greater inaccuracy in populations with no known CKD than in those with CKD. Nonetheless, the current eGFR technique facilitates the detection, evaluation, and management of renal disease.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and 24-hour urine protein excretion in non-diabetic subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although we are unable to determine whether hypobilirubinemia has a causative effect, these findings suggest that hypobilirubinemia combined with diabetes might be associated with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Large prospective trials are needed to better assess the effects of bilirubin on diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Hematuria [^d5f3a63e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

Hematuria, menstruation, exercise, and infection can falsely elevate albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) by increasing albumin and protein in urine, while nonalbumin proteins can cause a false decrease because other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration also affects ratios: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion therefore higher ACR and PCR, whereas males have higher urinary creatinine excretion therefore lower ACR and PCR; low weight with low urinary creatinine excretion can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, whereas high weight with high urinary creatinine excretion can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower creatinine excretion with acute kidney injury or low-protein intake, and higher creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise, also influence results.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^e493f6c5]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, kidney function and proteinuria have yet to be fully elucidated, nor have these relationships been investigated in Korean adults.

Method

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults who were evaluated at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. We evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older.

Results

The values of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 24-hour urine albumin ≥ 150 mg/day were observed in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of subjects, respectively. Fasting glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL were observed in 44.9% (n = 612) of the total sample. After adjustment for potential confounding factors including demographic characteristics, comorbidities and other laboratory measures, total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with proteinuria both in the whole cohort and in a subgroup of diabetic individuals.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the relationships among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein and kidney function in Korean adults. We demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^7aed817e]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the associations among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein and kidney function in Korean adults.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1363 adults aged 18 years or older who were seen at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) in the five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. This study demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and was positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

Our findings are in contrast to the results of Targher et al. in their observational large hospital-based sample of 2678 adult outpatients (mean age: 55 ± 18 years; 43% male), including 210 diabetic patients. In that study, they found that serum total bilirubin was inversely associated with eGFR in both non-diabetic (r = -0.17; p < 0.0001) and diabetic patients (r = -0.14; p < 0.05). However, no information was available on albuminuria, comorbidites, alcohol consumption or other important potential confounders. In this study, we could not analyzed the effects of alcohol and smoking on proteinuria, because we were unable to locate data on alcohol drinking and smoking.

### The Italian preparticipation evaluation programme: diagnostic yield, rate of disqualification and cost analysis [^9dd06a45]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Protocol of PPE

The PPE protocol for competitive non-professional athletes is established by the Italian lawand regional regulations. It is carried out by a physician with a specialty degree in sports medicine obtained after 4 years of full-time training and in-depth instruction in ECG interpretation. The first-line evaluation included history, physical examination, visual acuity test with Snellen chart, resting 12-lead ECG, ECG stress testing, spirometry and urine dipstick. History focused on family background, lifestyle (ie, training level, smoking…), previous medical history and cardiac symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope). Physical examination included cardiac, pulmonary and abdominal examination, bend test to check for scoliosis, weight, height and blood pressure measurement. In athletes > 40 years, the CV risk was calculated with the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk charts. Resting 12-lead ECG was acquired before stress testing, with the athlete supine at standard speed (25 mm) and gain (0.1 mV/mm) and interpreted according to the international recommendation for ECG interpretation in athletes. According to the law, the protocol of stress testing was age-dependent and justified by the different prevalence of at-risk CV diseases, namely inherited arrhythmogenic disorders in young athletes and coronary artery disease in masters athletes. Young competitive athletes < 35 years underwent a bicycle stress test with a constant load, that is, 2 or 3 W/kg (depending on gender) increase per 3 min or until > 85% of the maximal heart rate was achieved, plus 3 min of postexercise monitoring, with the main aim of assessing for ventricular arrhythmias. Masters athletes aged ≥ 35 years underwent a standard maximal exercise test with an incremental protocol, that is, 50 W increment increase every 2 min until exhaustion, plus 6 min of recovery, with attention to exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia or arrhythmias. Spirometry measured flow and volume changes during forced breathing manoeuvres. Particular attention was given to flow volume curve and to measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio. Urine dipstick is a basic diagnostic tool that allows to analyse the presence of proteins, glucose, ketones, haemoglobin, bilirubin, urobilinogen, acetone, nitrite and leucocytes using a test strip immersed in a urine sample.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^f23e6e58]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### High-normal serum uric acid increases risk of early progressive renal function loss in type 1 diabetes: results of a 6-year follow-up [^f7b11534]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The paradigm of early diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes has changed during the past few years. Previously, it focused on urinary leakage of small amounts of albumin, designated microalbuminuria, which was believed to predict progression to overt proteinuria and ultimately end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, recent studies documented that rather than progression, regression to normoalbuminuria is the fate of microalbuminuria in the majority of patients. Progression to proteinuria is the fate in a minority only. At the same time, the onset of progressive renal function loss was observed in a subset of these patients well before the onset of proteinuria. Because this decline occurs while renal function is still normal, we label it "early" progressive renal function loss (early GFR loss). Whereas microalbuminuria may regress, remain stable, or progress during the course of diabetes, early GFR loss progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD.

Because early GFR loss is detectable while renal function is normal or elevated, an opportunity may exist for effective intervention many years before the occurrence of meaningful loss of renal function. However, our knowledge of early GFR loss determinants is limited. Discovery of these determinants, especially modifiable ones, may enable the design of more effective programs for the prevention of CKD and ESRD.

A body of evidence suggests that elevated serum uric acid may cause kidney injury in animal models. Also, mounting evidence points to a role of elevated serum uric acid in the development of kidney disease in humans. In cohort studies of subjects without diabetes, hyperuricemia predicted the development of CKD stage 3 and ESRD, and in community-based cohorts moderately elevated serum uric acid concentrations were associated with the development of CKD stage 3. Recently, in a type 1 diabetic cohort in Denmark, moderately elevated uric acid concentrations were found to be associated with risk of proteinuria during an 18-year follow-up. However, changes in renal function were not examined.

### Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology (CKDu): a systematic review of the literature [^4a17abd7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is wide variability in CKDu definitions across studies. This can impact patient outcomes through diagnostic misclassification, hinder the comparability of disease burden across studies, and potentially influence the allocation of resources for public health interventions. Developing standardized diagnostic criteria for CKDu — accounting for population differences, disease severity, and both research and clinical contexts — will enhance the comparability of evidence and may improve informed clinical decision-making. There should be consistency in criteria for excluding proteinuria/albuminuria and hypertension across similar studies as these are the main causes of misclassification. The definition of CKDu should be updated regularly informed by the changing research landscape.

Study selection

The results of the literature search are shown in the Fig. 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded after a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of the remaining studies were excluded: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses; 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; 6 reports were not case series or cohort studies; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes; 2 failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation; 1 each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10. The remaining 17 studies comprise this review.

### Biomarkers in sepsis [^6f6b7c38]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ORGAN DYSFUNCTION

A systemic inflammatory response to infection (sepsis) can lead on to multiple organ dysfunction (severe sepsis). At present, the tools available for clinicians to diagnose organ dysfunction are limited in their capacity to detect early change. Renal dysfunction is currently diagnosed by a fall in urine output and a rise in serum urea and creatinine. However, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response to hypovolaemia whereas, in patients with previously normal kidneys, creatinine does not rise above normal values until the glomerular filtration rate has fallen by approximately 75%. A vast array of blood and urine biomarkers, of which more than 30 are currently described, can detect decreases in renal function (e.g. cystatin C) or direct tubular stress or injury [e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)] at a much earlier stage. In addition, biomarkers can be used to predict renal recovery. At present, it is unclear which biomarkers best prognosticate for significant renal dysfunction and injury, and which can be successfully used to direct therapy to prevent (or at least ameliorate) acute kidney injury.

The same applies to the liver where traditional markers of dysfunction such as hyperbilirubinaemia and coagulopathy occur relatively late, peaking at 3–5 days after the diagnosis of sepsis. However, we have recently shown impaired biotransformation and hepatobiliary transport in a rat model as early as 6 h after faecal peritoneal contamination. This early dysfunction is supported by a significant rise in plasma bile acids in 48 patients on the day severe sepsis was diagnosed; unlike bilirubin (AUC 0.59), bile acid levels predicted 28-day mortality with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC up to 0.87).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^6a130be4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a7d9d51c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^94a40f52]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — initially low/negligible-risk with hematuria on repeat urinalysis: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis. In such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)

### An observational study of children with sickle cell disease in kilifi, Kenya [^9118b56b]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The mean haemoglobin concentration in children with SCD in our study (73 g/l) was similar to that reported in other parts of Africa (65–83 g/l). Higher values of 80–90 g/l have been reported from studies conducted in Jamaica and the USA, an observation that may be explained by the higher prevalence of iron deficiency found in Kilifi. Our observation that MCV was significantly raised in children with SCD is consistent with previous studies, presumably due to the presence of a significant number of reticulocytes in the peripheral circulation. The mean MCHC (mean cell haemoglobin concentration) of 318 g/l is consistent with other reports from Africa but slightly lower than reported in Jamaica. It is also significantly lower than that of normal children from the local population. The finding of a raised white blood cell count has been well-described in developed countries, and has been identified as a marker of severe SCD and, specifically, as a risk factor for early death, stroke, acute chest syndrome and nephropathy. Whether the same will be true in this population is, as yet, unknown. The mean bilirubin concentration in patients in our cohort was raised at 46 μmol/l. In steady-state SCD, hyperbilirubinaemia is usually attributable to haemolysis rather than hepatic disease. Other tests of liver function are usually normal, although derangements at older ages have been found in some studies. We are not aware of any previous reports of AST levels in steady-state African patients with SCD. One study found that lactate dehydrogenase levels were almost threefold higher than normal in adults and children living with SCD in the Congo, although whether this was due to haemolysis or hepatic dysfunction is unclear. As expected, renal function tests were normal in all patients and the majority had a normal urine dipstick, although proteinuria and haematuria were detected in some older children. Ongoing follow up of this cohort will establish how these abnormalities evolve in later childhood.

### Urobilin: its clinical significance… [^91fbad38]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

I. INTRODUCTION The numerous studies made on urobilin and urobilinogen during the forty-four years since its discovery by Jaffé, while adding much to our knowledge of its chemistry and its clinical occurrence, still leave much to be desired as to methods for its estimation and as to its clinical significance. Some investigators are inclined to look on it still from the point of view of hemoglobin metabolism, while others consider it only in reference to hepatic insufficiency. Its relationship to the presence or absence of bile in the intestine has been a subject of considerable dispute, but in the main the contention of Friedrich von Müller, that it can originate only from the bacterial decomposition of bile reaching the intestine, is accepted. Nevertheless, the assertion of Fischler, that it can originate in the liver itself, seems to us probable. Whether it is then formed within the liver cell or. WILBUR RL, ADDIS T.

### Interpreting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy: the need for a more pathophysiological approach [^9ceed91b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

This review and opinion article focuses on the definitions and meanings of abnormal protein excretion in pregnancy, asking the following questions: Are our tests to determine abnormal proteinuria adequately performed? Are current guidelines for diagnosis of excessive proteinuria, especially when used to identify preeclampsia, supported by adequate data? Can the magnitude of proteinuria be used as a reliable clinical biomarker of the gravity of preeclampsia? Should timed urine collections, primarily 24-hour excretions, be supplanted by the urine protein/creatinine ratio in clinical practice? The answers to most of these questions are: We are not sure, or some guidelines are poorly supported by data and may prove erroneous. We suggest a more physiologic approach to assessment of proteinuria and believe that if clinicians and investigators looked at proteinuria in terms of how the kidney handles protein in health and disease it would lead to a more rational and evidence-based approach to proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, we recommend that current cutoff for abnormal proteinuria be used to diagnose preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria should not guide management. Other variables, such as status of blood pressure control, evidence of increasing organ damage in the liver and hematological systems, evidence of falling glomerular filtration rate, and signs of neurological involvement, are more reliable indicators of severity of preeclampsia.

### Atazanavir (atazanavir sulfate) [^8e2b2a5b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^688865da]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the 1363 subjects enrolled in this study are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of subjects

Among the 1363 adult subjects, the mean age and total bilirubin were 55.6 (± 14.1) years and 0.75 (± 0.21) mg/dL, respectively. An eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and a 24-hour urine protein ≥ 150 mg/day were present in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of the subjects, respectively. Diabetes and hypertension were present in 44.9% (n = 612) and 14.0% (n = 191) of patients.

The clinical and biochemical characteristics of subjects stratified according to eGFR category are summarized in Table 2. Compared with patients with normal or near-normal eGFR, persons with lower eGFR were older, more likely to be male, and had greater prevalence for high serum total bilirubin concentration. A positive correlation was found between serum total bilirubin concentration and eGFR in all subjects and in diabetic patients (r = 0.128, p = 0.0001; r = 0.202, p = 0.0001) (Figure 1, 2). An inverse correlation was found between total serum bilirubin concentration and 24-hour urine albumin in all subjects and in subjects with diabetes (r = -0.228, p = 0.0001; r = -0.227, p = 0.0001) (Figure 3, 4).

### Systemic light chain amyloidosis, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^14da1103]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Systemic light chain amyloidosis — organ involvement and renal/liver assessment: To assess organ involvement, the workup should include urinalysis with quantification of proteinuria by 24-hour urine collection and measurement of creatinine clearance (calculated or measured directly). Free light chains (FLCs) are cleared by the kidney; therefore, renal insufficiency increases the concentrations of FLC, and in that case the kappa/lambda ratio or the difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs should be monitored. Tests to assess renal function such as serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, calcium, serum uric acid, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and beta-2 microglobulin are also recommended by the NCCN Panel, and recommended liver function evaluation tests include alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin.

### Association of clinical phenotypes of depression with comorbid conditions, treatment patterns and outcomes: a 10-year region-based cohort study [^9944c45f]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Phenotype differences in laboratory biomarkers

An analysis of differences in laboratory biomarkers among clusters revealed significant variations between phenotypes (refer to Table S8 and Figure S3 in the Supplementary Information). Cluster D1 exhibited higher occurrences of chlorine and calcium levels above the normal range compared to other clusters. Furthermore, their median values for red blood cell count (6.40 [5.20, 7.50]), average red blood cell hemoglobin (HGB) (30.70 [29.70, 31.60]), and average red blood cell volume (93.40 [90.60, 96.05]) surpassed those of all other clusters (p < 0.001).

While comorbidities were infrequent in Cluster A1, laboratory markers played a more prominent role across all phenotypes. This cluster demonstrated higher occurrences of absolute lymphocyte value, urobilinogen, and urine protein above the normal range compared to other clusters (p < 0.001). These patients presented with the highest median values for various laboratory biomarkers (e.g. erythrocyte count, proportion of monocytes, lymphocyte proportion and absolute value, proportion of eosinophils, hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, potassium, white blood cell ratio, uric acid, calcium, anion gap, conductivity) and the lowest median values for others (e.g. average erythrocyte HGB, average erythrocyte volume, alanine aminotransferase, urea, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein) (p < 0.001).

Treatment patterns by phenotypes

The variations in treatment patterns across clusters are illustrated in Fig. 8, Table 2, and Supplementary Information 2.2's Tables S5 and S6. A summary of the treatment patterns for each phenotype within the five categories is provided below.

### Management and screening of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^b0073217]. AUA (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vesicoureteral reflux, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory follow-up, AUA 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain annual urinalysis for proteinuria and bacteriuria, including a urine culture and sensitivity if the urinalysis is suggestive of infection.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^7ed73f07]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary biomarkers of kidney injury are presumed to reflect renal tubular damage. However, their concentrations may be influenced by other factors, such as hematuria or pyuria. We sought to examine what non-injury related urinalysis factors are associated with urinary biomarker levels.

Methods

We examined 714 adults who underwent cardiac surgery in the TRIBE-AKI cohort that did not experience post-operative clinical AKI (patients with serum creatinine change of ≥ 20% were excluded). We examined the association between urinalysis findings and the pre- and first post-operative urinary concentrations of 4 urinary biomarkers: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP).

Results

The presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis was associated with increased urinary NGAL (R 2 0.16, p < 0.001 and R 2 0.07, p < 0.001, respectively) in pre-operative samples. Hematuria was associated with increased levels of all 4 biomarkers, with a much stronger association seen in post-operative samples (R 2 between 0.02 and 0.21). Dipstick proteinuria concentrations correlated with levels of all 4 urinary biomarkers in pre-operative and post-operative samples (R 2 between 0.113 and 0.194 in pre-operative and between 0.122 and 0.322 in post-operative samples). Adjusting the AUC of post-operative AKI for dipstick proteinuria lowered the AUC for all 4 biomarkers at the pre-operative time point and for 2 of the 4 biomarkers at the post-operative time point.

Conclusions

Several factors available through urine dipstick testing are associated with increased urinary biomarker concentrations that are independent of clinical kidney injury. Future studies should explore the impact of these factors on the prognostic and diagnostic performance of these AKI biomarkers.

### Uric acid as a potential cue to screen for iron overload [^78821dbd]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It is suggested that targeted screening for hemochromatosis and iron overload may be worthwhile. The aim of this study was to examine uric acid as a potential indicator of the presence of iron overload.

Methods

We analyzed adults aged 20 and older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2002. We computed logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, liver or kidney condition, and alcohol use to see the relationship between combinations of uric acid and ferritin with the outcomes of elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria.

Results

In unadjusted analyses, 20.7% of individuals with high uric acid had high ferritin levels versus 8.8% of individuals with low uric acid levels (P < .001). Individuals with both elevated uric acid and elevated ferritin levels had significantly higher liver enzymes than individuals with either elevated uric acid or ferritin. With low uric acid and low ferritin as the reference category, individuals with high uric acid and high ferritin were significantly more likely to also have proteinuria (odds ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.82–3.91).

Conclusions

Elevated levels of uric acid is associated with elevated ferritin levels and may serve as a risk stratification variable for presence of iron overload and hemochromatosis.

### BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen [^b2dd9331]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Main

Bilirubin, an intermediate of the haem degradation pathway, plays a critical role in human physiology through the gut–liver axis. Alongside other organic molecules in bile such as cholesterol and bile acids, bilirubin diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin) is secreted into the gut where it is either excreted or reabsorbed. When bilirubin diglucuronide is deconjugated by human or bacterial beta-glucuronidases into unconjugated bilirubin, it can be readily reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation or further metabolized via reduction reactions by gut microorganisms into the more excretable metabolites urobilinogen and stercobilinogen. Bilirubin reabsorption elevates serum bilirubin levels, while excretion as urobilinogen and stercobilinogen in stool and urine facilitates its clearance, completing the haem degradation pathway – (Fig. 1a).

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^4a488d82]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Urine dipsticks are a cheap, readily available, "point of care" test. We found significant interference from factors in urine measured by dipstick and the novel AKI biomarkers investigated here. Future studies should assess the interference of common urine elements on levels of biomarkers of interest and explore the impact of accounting for these elements on their prognostic/diagnostic performance.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^577352c8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AGA best practice advice 3 — investigation is directed to determining the cause of AKI, which can be due to hypovolemic causes (volume responsive, and the most common cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis), acute tubular necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome with AKI (HRS-AKI), HRS with acute kidney disease (a type of functional renal failure of < 3 months- duration in which criteria for HRS-AKI are not met), or postrenal, which occurs only rarely; the specific type of AKI should be identified through a careful history, physical examination, blood biochemistry, urine microscopic examination, urine chemistry (Na+ and urea) and selected urinary biomarkers, and renal ultrasound.

### Diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative point of care urine albumin to creatinine ratio and urine dipstick analysis in a primary care resource limited setting in South Africa [^cc063fbc]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations: the POC testing was performed in a laboratory environment on the same day as laboratory measurements and not at the patient side, in a less controlled environment it is possible the POC instrument will not perform to the same standards. The urine samples were kept in a fridge overnight and then frozen the next day at -80 °C before being shipped frozen to the central laboratory. Previous studies have shown good stability of urine albumin and ACR with long term storage at -70 °C, urine albumin and ACR is stable for up to 7 days when stored at 4 °C. To our knowledge no studies exist on the stability of urine dipstick analysis in previously frozen samples. Dipstick analysis on samples post refrigeration up to 48 h has shown: glucose to be stable up to 48 h at 4 °C; nitrites stable up to 24 h at 4 °C; leucocytes, haemoglobin, red blood cells, bilirubin show increased false negative results at 4 °C from between 4 and 8 h. It is possible the POC device would perform better on fresh urine as this is the recommended sample from the manufacturer (due to bilirubin and urobilinogen deterioration), however frozen and refrigerated samples can be used if returned to room temperature. Despite the widespread use of immunoassays and the kinetic Jaffe method to measure laboratory ACR, these methods remain far from ideal gold standards with which to compare POC ACR. There is currently no reference method or material for urine albumin; as such methods are not standardised despite this being a goal of the National Kidney Disease Education Program. Comparison of results between different methods have generally not found large biases. Although isotope dilution mass spectrometry-traceability has been established for the Jaffe method and a primary reference material exists the lack of matrix-specific secondary reference materials for urine creatinine mean that calibration is not ideal. Consequently, the use of laboratory ACR as the gold standard in our study was a pragmatic rather than ideal choice. Our study also has several advantages, the large sample size from a rural population in South Africa represents an important demographic group where POC testing may be most beneficial. While random urine sampling is not the recommended sample type (versus concentrated early morning sampling) it represents the situation that will be encountered across rural clinics in South Africa. We were able to process all 700 samples, without having to exclude outliers- and so better represent the clinical situation which would be encountered by health care workers.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: clinical report [^f678d2e5]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — kidney complications include hyposthenuria beginning in infancy with prolonged enuresis risk, where fluid restriction may promote intravascular sickling and painful events; management includes counseling about the SCD-related concentrating defect, timed overnight waking to void, and waterproof mattress covers; renal papillary necrosis presents with painless gross hematuria and evaluation includes urinalysis, urine culture, abdominal ultrasonography, and screening coagulation tests with treatment of bed rest and hydration; proteinuria may progress to renal insufficiency, and if the protein-to-creatinine ratio is repeatedly elevated, screening of a first morning voided urine and referral to nephrology is advised.

### Association between elevated serum transaminase and moderately increased albuminuria: a cross-sectional study in Western tokushima, Japan [^e0e90717]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

A large-scale Japanese cross-sectional study showed the lowest probability of proteinuria in mild drinkers. The same study suggested that GGT had a clinically greater impact on proteinuria than alcohol consumption. This study found no significant association between moderately drinking and moderately increased albuminuria. However, the association with elevated GGT was similar. Future studies should conduct a survey that includes the amount and frequency of different types of alcoholic beverages and drinking patterns.

Given the mechanism of association between liver disorder and renal diseases such as moderately increased albuminuria, decreasing eGFR and so on, we are assuming increased oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Oxidative stress is known to cause proteinuria and lead to increase serum GGT levels. Serum GGT levels have a potential use as a marker of oxidative stress. Moreover, serum GGT is reported to be associated with insulin resistance, while insulin resistance is known to be associated with renal abnormalities such as CKD, for example. More specifically, an epidemiological study among non-obese and non-diabetic inpatients showed that moderately increased albuminuria was independently associated with insulin resistance.

Elevated serum ALT was found to be independently associated with CKD among middle-aged women, regardless of the GGT elevation. A cross-sectional study in a rural Chinese population revealed a positive association between elevated serum ALT levels and cardiometabolic risk factors, such as hypertension and abdominal obesity. Elevated serum ALT may be caused by damaged liver cells and the accumulation of fat in the liver. However, the mechanism of association between elevated serum ALT and renal disease remains unclear.

The present study showed that low AST/ALT ratio was significantly associated with moderately increased albuminuria even in the absence of elevated GGT. However, there was no significant association between elevated ALT and increased albuminuria. (Table 4) Further studies are needed to clarify the association between the combination of elevated AST or low AST/ALT ratio, elevated GGT, and moderately increased albuminuria.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^f22e97cd]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — urinalysis and culture in idiopathic overactive bladder states that dipstick or microscopic urinalysis should be performed in all patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to evaluate for other causes of LUTS, and urine culture should be performed when urinalysis is suggestive of infection and/or hematuria. Any identified UTI should be treated, and the patient should be instructed to follow up for assessment if symptoms do not resolve. If microscopic hematuria (> 3 RBC/HPF) is identified in the absence of infection, further evaluation should be performed in accordance with the Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline, and the presence of glucosuria or proteinuria may be the sequelae of diabetes.

### Prevalence and impact of acute renal impairment on COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bdafe71b]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis showed that renal impairment in patients with COVID-19 is common. The manifestations of kidney damage are diverse, ranging from abnormal urine analysis, elevated sCr or BUN levels, to AKI and renal failure for which CRRT is required. Among these renal impairments, abnormal urine analysis is the most frequent. 57.2% patients have proteinuria, in which mild proteinuria (+) as well as moderate or severe proteinuria (++ to +++) account for 38.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Cheng's study has found that compared with patients without proteinuria, patients with proteinuria+ and ++ to +++ had a 1.5-fold and fivefold increased risk of death, respectively, indicating that proteinuria is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, so more attention should be paid to urine analysis in clinical practice.

Another main kidney damage manifestation was elevated sCr and BUN levels with incidence rate of 9.6 and 13.7%, respectively. Elevated sCr and BUN levels may be due to chronic kidney disease or AKI. Cheng's study showed that the baseline sCr was elevated in 15.5% COVID-19 patients on admission; patients with elevated baseline of sCr were more likely to develop AKI and more severe AKI. Meanwhile, elevated baseline sCr and BUN levels was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. Therefore, we should increase more awareness to COVID-19 patients who had elevated baseline sCr.

Our meta-analysis showed that the averaged incidence of AKI was 4.5%, ranging from 1.3 to 36.4% dependent on the different severity of the illness. The exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated AKI is unclear. Based on the results of our meta-analysis in combination with our frontline experience, we consider that the etiology of renal impairment is likely to be diverse and multifactorial. Besides the direct attack by the SARS-CoV-2, hypoxia and hypercoagulability also contribute to kidney damage.

### Bilirubin attenuates the renal tubular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis [^3a231edc]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Bilirubin (BIL) reduced the urine concentration of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) in CsA-induced nephropathy (CIN)

Table 1 shows the physiologic parameters of animals at the end of experiment. CsA-treated rats presented a significant increase in serum creatinine (P < 0.01), but this was not improved by BIL treatment. The excretion of 24-hr urine albumin was not significantly increased in CsA-treated rats (5.4 ± 4.1 mg/day, 4.8 ± 5.1 mg/day, 9.1 ± 6.5 mg/day, and 6.6 ± 3.0 mg/day in vehicle (VH), BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA groups, respectively). There were no significant differences in body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), AST, and ALT among the groups. CsA blood level increased in CsA and BIL + CsA groups (P < 0.01). Serum bilirubin was not increased in VH and BIL groups at the time of sacrifice, and increased in CsA and BIL + CsA groups (P < 0.01) (Table 1). Urine NGAL and KIM-1 have been recognized as markers of renal tubular injuries. CsA significantly increased the urine concentrations of KIM-1 and NGAL (P < 0.05). BIL pretreatment reduced the CsA-induced increase of urine concentration of KIM-1(P < 0.05) (urine KIM-1, 1050.0 ± 261.3 pg/ml, 735.0 ± 120.2 pg/ml, 2278.0 ± 1523.3 pg/ml, and 858.0 ± 340.3 pg/ml; VH, BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA, respectively). In addition, a tendency, although statistically insignificant, for decreased urine NGAL concentration was shown in BIL-pretreated rats; urine NGAL, 512.2 ± 451.3 ng/ml, 852.6 ± 536.3 ng/ml, 1457.5 ± 1060.0 ng/ml and 668.0 ± 345.7 ng/ml; VH, BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA, respectively (Figure 2 A, 2 B).

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^817bb16a]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

Special considerations — pediatric and older adults — in pediatric populations, increases in albuminuria and proteinuria are associated with increased risk of disease progression, and studies detailed in Table 18 highlight the value of measuring albuminuria/proteinuria; in older adults, urine ACR may be elevated due to loss of muscle mass leading to lower SCr and lower urinary CrCl, and in older adults or people with frailty the interpretation of urine ACR should consider age‑related changes in muscle mass and/or sarcopenia.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^156072ab]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^ce3e3e87]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — diagnostic evaluation when superimposed preeclampsia is uncertain (Level C): The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C). In cases of diagnostic uncertainty in discriminating transient blood pressure increases in chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia, particularly with severe-range blood pressures, initial surveillance in the hospital setting is recommended. Work-up should include evaluation of hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and liver function tests as well as assessment of new-onset proteinuria, and serum uric acid may be a helpful marker. Elevated hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, hyperuricemia, new-onset or worsening proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine, and elevated liver transaminases are more indicative of preeclampsia than chronic hypertension, and the practitioner should think preeclampsia first. Fetal well-being should be assessed with fetal heart rate monitoring and sonography, and serial blood pressure assessment during 4–8 hours can be helpful in discriminating acute and serious increases in blood pressure from transient hypertension.

### Multicenter pivotal clinical trial of urine malaria test for rapid diagnosis of plasmodium falciparum malaria [^1a41e61a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sample collection and handling.

Upon enrollment, a case report form was completed for each participant. Matched finger-prick blood and urine samples were collected for malaria microscopy, RDT, UMT, and urinalysis. Blood spots were prepared from finger-prick blood samples on Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare Life Science, United Kingdom). RF testing was done on a cohort of microscopy-negative patients.

UMT technology and procedure.

The UMT technology relies on the fact that in clinical malaria, febrile patients shed elevated levels of proteins, includingproteins, in urine, and the test detects HRP-2 shed in the urine of individuals infected with malaria. The UMT (Fyodor Biotechnologies, Inc. Baltimore, MD, USA) was performed per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a test strip was dipped into a labeled 2-ml test tube containing 200 μl of urine and incubated for 10 min. The strip was removed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, after which the result was read. No clinical decision regarding patient care was made based on UMT results.

BinaxNOW (Pf/Pan) malaria RDT, urinalysis, rheumatoid arthritis test (RF test), and dry blood spot procedure.

The BinaxNOW (Pf/Pan) blood-based malaria RDT (Alere, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay that detects HRP-2 antigen found in(BinaxNOW Pf), and aldolase, a pan-malaria antigen found in allspecies (BinaxNOW Pan). The test was performed per the manufacturer's instructions and was used as a comparator RDT. Multianalyte urinalysis reagent strips (Rapid Labs, Essex, United Kingdom) were used to measure glucose, bilirubin, specific gravity, ketones, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrites, serum creatinine, and leukocytes. A direct slide test was used to detect RF (Arlington Scientific, Inc. USA). All tests were performed per the manufacturer's instruction.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^b9cb847f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — diagnostic evaluation for suspected superimposed preeclampsia emphasizes that it often is difficult to distinguish chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia when a patient presents with elevated blood pressure later in pregnancy, and that initial surveillance in the hospital setting is recommended with evaluation of hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, liver function tests, and assessment of new-onset proteinuria; serum uric acid may be a helpful marker, and elevated hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, hyperuricemia, new-onset or worsening proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine, and elevated liver transaminases are more indicative of preeclampsia, with fetal well-being assessed as appropriate with fetal heart rate monitoring and sonography; serial blood pressure assessment during 4–8 hours can be helpful, and in challenging cases assessment may require up to 48 hours.

### Jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy [^f3d27d6e]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. Previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. Our goal was to determine the incidence of UTIs in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with UTIs.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old for evidence of a UTI (defined as > 10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). A serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. Detailed questionnaires were completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events.

Results

Twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a UTI (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). Isolated organisms included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of UTI, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. Abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a UTI, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results.

Conclusion

A UTI was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. In addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a UTI. Therefore, we recommend that testing for a UTI be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting to the emergency department.

### Low serum bilirubin concentration is a predictor of chronic kidney disease [^31258277]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. It is very important to identify the factors that affect CKD. Previous studies have reported that serum bilirubin concentration was positively correlated with renal function in a cross-sectional study. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and the progression of CKD.

Methods

A cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of 2784 subjects without CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², at baseline. We analyzed the relationship between serum total bilirubin concentration at baseline and new-onset CKD in the general population.

Results

We followed the subjects for a median period of 7.7 years. There were 1157 females and 1627 males, and 231 females and 370 males developed CKD during this period. Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed that serum total bilirubin concentration (hazard ratio (HR) per 1.0 μmol/L increase 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.99), P = 0.0084) in addition to age, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), uric acid (UA), creatinine and medication for hypertension in men and serum total bilirubin concentration (HR per 1.0 μmol/L increase 0.96 (95% CI 0.93–1.00), P = 0.0309) in addition to age, GGT, alanine aminotransferase, UA, creatinine and medication for dyslipidemia in women were independent predictors of new-onset CKD, after adjusting for confounders.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration could be a novel risk factor for the progression of CKD, defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), in the general population.

### Using dipstick urinalysis to predict development of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 [^133dbac1]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The unique kidney pathology associated with COVID-19 highlights the importance of developing AKI risk prediction models specific to this population. Acute tubular necrosis may be a common etiology of AKI, as it is in other hospital settings; however, data also support virus-mediated injury involving cytokine storm, thrombotic microangiopathy, and glomerulonephritis as possible causes of kidney injury in COVID-19. Our findings that proteinuria and hematuria on dipstick urinalysis are associated with increased risk for AKI may suggest presence of subclinical kidney pathology prior to clinically apparent AKI. In other words, if SARS-CoV-2 infection directly affects the tubular epithelium and/or the podocyte, the proteinuria and hematuria seen on urinalysis may represent an earlier phase of AKI that precedes the rise in serum creatinine. Alternatively, the findings could be consistent with the heuristic in nephrology that those with preexisting kidney disease are more at risk for developing AKI in the setting of other acute illnesses supported by the fact that adding CKD presence and baseline creatinine to the model improved the prognostic capability of the model. Given that those who developed AKI carried much higher rates of documented CKD, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, these findings may represent underlying chronic disease rather than acute changes in dipstick urinalysis results. However, given that the risk of AKI was also increased in models that only included proteinuria and hematuria, it is possible to infer that dipstick proteinuria and hematuria are indicative of an active urinary sediment and additional kidney pathology beyond the presence of prior CKD. Overall, our findings support that AKI in the setting of COVID-19 is likely multifactorial and may not be limited to acute tubular necrosis related to severe acute illness.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^65a417ee]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

Figure 1.
The patient's urine on the day of presentation to hospital (sixth day of primaquine prophylaxis).

On the day of presentation, the patient's hemoglobin was 88 g/L (reference range: 135–185 g/L), hematocrit 0.26 (0.4–0.54), and mean cell volume 96 fL (78–100 fL). Microcytic spherocytes, bite cells, and polychromasia were noted on blood film. Serial microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests for P. falciparum and common Plasmodium antigens were negative. Unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated (97 µmol/L [0–19 µmol/L] and 781 U/L [120–250 U/L], respectively), and haptoglobin was subnormal (< 0.10 g/L [0.36–1.95 g/L]). A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Spectrophotometry confirmed deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (2.2 U/g Hb; reference range: 5.0–13.0 U/g Hb), and hemoglobin electrophoresis did not show any concomitant hemoglobinopathies. Plasma cell-free hemoglobin concentration was elevated (120,004 ng/mL [< 50,000 ng/mL]). He had albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 7.4 [< 2.5]), increased urinary glycocalyx metabolite excretion (11.16 total glycosaminoglycans/mol creatinine)and markedly elevated urinary beta-2-microglobulin (40,019 µg/L; normal range < 300). Plasma creatinine and urea were normal (66 µmol/L [60–110 µmol/L] and 7.0 mmol/L [3.0–7.5 mmol/L], respectively).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia — diagnostic criteria and thresholds — require elevated blood pressure plus proteinuria or specific end-organ findings. Blood pressure criteria are SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions ≥ 4 h apart after 20 wk of gestation in a previously normotensive woman, or SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Proteinuria can be ≥ 300 mg per 24 h, Protein/ creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, or dipstick 2+. In the absence of proteinuria, criteria include thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 10⁹/L), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentrations > 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration), impaired liver function (elevated transaminases to twice normal concentration), pulmonary edema, or new‑onset headache unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses or visual symptoms.

Microhematuria — follow-up after negative evaluation: In patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9b5ee3f3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Pre-eclampsia is a valuable opportunity to diagnose chronic kidney disease: a multicentre study [^7fad4080]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

HELLP syndrome was defined as per the above guidelines (alanine or aspartate transaminase levels ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal); haemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase > 600 U/L; peripheral blood smears with evidence of damaged erythrocytes; serum bilirubin ≥ 1.2 mg/dL; platelet count < 100 000/μL).

Superimposed PE was defined as PE on already known, pre-gestational hypertension, treated or not, or on already known CKD.

Patients with known CKD who had been referred to the obstetric ward by a nephrologist were excluded from this analysis. Cases in which a kidney disease was known but had been overlooked as a risk factor in pregnancy were retained, since we considered that, in the absence of specific follow-up, the natural history of PE was not influenced by prenatal care. There were eight cases, four in Cagliari (one patient with single kidney due to nephrectomy for carcinoma; one with nephrectomy for malformation; two cases of diabetic nephropathy, with proteinuria before pregnancy) four in Le Mans (two patients with kidney graft; one case with vescico-ureteral reflux with surgery in infancy; one case with relapsing pyelonephritis).

Small for gestational age babies were defined according to the two most commonly used cut-points: below the 5th and 10th centiles, following INTERGROWTH standards.

Preterm delivery was defined as delivery before 37 completed gestational weeks; early preterm delivery as before 34 and very-early preterm delivery as delivery before 28 completed gestational weeks.

Obesity was defined by a pre-gestational body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²; overweight as BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m², and underweight as BMI < 20 kg/m².

Age was considered as a risk factor when ≥ 40 years and ≤ 20 years at delivery. The following clinical data were likewise considered as potential risk factors for the development of PE: previous hypertension, diabetes, collagen disease, assisted fertilization, multiple pregnancies, personal or family history of PE, BMI ≥ 30 and BMI ˂20 kg/m 2.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^b8d18e11]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension — urine dipstick screening for acutely elevated serum creatinine: In a prospective observational study, 143 patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 115 mm Hg were evaluated with serum creatinine and a urine dipstick, and of 143 patients, 24 met criteria for acutely elevated serum creatinine (> 1.2 or acute elevation > 25% above baseline). The presence of either hematuria or proteinuria on dipstick identified these patients with 100% sensitivity and 29.7% specificity, and specificity rose to 42.4% when an abnormal dipstick was defined as hematuria or ≥ 1+ proteinuria; reported 95% CI 83% to 100%.
