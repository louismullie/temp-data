## Question

Weaning escitalopram 20mg strategy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a weaning strategy for escitalopram 20 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk profile for discontinuation syndrome. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram and how that influences taper design. Next, I will review the evidence base for tapering strategies, including hyperbolic tapering and the pitfalls of short tapers. After that, I need to translate this into a practical, stepwise taper with contingencies for withdrawal and relapse. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and patient counseling, and I will double-check any areas where I might be overgeneralizing from limited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Escitalopram is an SSRI with an intermediate half-life, and abrupt discontinuation is associated with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome characterized by dysphoria, anxiety, dizziness, sensory disturbances, insomnia, and other symptoms; the FDA explicitly recommends gradual dose reduction rather than abrupt cessation, and escitalopram is among agents with higher frequencies of discontinuation symptoms in meta-analyses, so I need to ensure a cautious, individualized taper plan [^439fb47d] [^a4d6f08f].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic foundation before proposing a schedule. Escitalopram's elimination half-life is roughly 27–32 hours, which explains why withdrawal can emerge within a few days of stopping and why steady-state changes with dose reductions can still provoke symptoms; this supports tapering over weeks to months rather than days, and it also cautions against simply spacing doses every other day, which can increase receptor occupancy fluctuation and worsen withdrawal according to modeling work [^ef991365] [^eec222d8].

> I will now examine the evidence for tapering strategies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from traditional short tapers; conventional 2–4 week tapers down to 10 mg then 5 mg are often insufficient and show little benefit over abrupt discontinuation in some studies, whereas hyperbolic (exponentially decreasing) tapers that extend over months and reach very low doses better align with SERT occupancy dynamics and patient-reported tolerability; psychological support during tapering, especially CBT or MBCT, improves successful discontinuation and reduces relapse risk compared with tapering alone, so I should integrate these elements into the plan [^ef991365] [^4f98f4e1] [^381244a6].

> Let me think about a practical, stepwise taper for 20 mg. I should confirm that the first decrement is conservative because early steps are most likely to trigger symptoms; a reasonable approach is to reduce to 15 mg for 2–4 weeks, then 10 mg for 2–4 weeks, then 5 mg for 2–4 weeks, then 2.5 mg for 2–4 weeks, and finally 1–2.5 mg every other day or even 1 mg daily for 2–4 weeks before stopping, with the entire process spanning 3–4 months; if withdrawal emerges, I should pause or slow the taper and consider returning to the prior dose temporarily before proceeding more slowly, which is consistent with FDA guidance and expert recommendations [^439fb47d] [^ef991365] [^a100ec28].

> But wait, what if standard tablet strengths make very low dosing impractical? I should double-check formulation options. Liquid escitalopram allows 1 mg decrements, and pill-splitting can achieve 2.5 mg; if neither is available, some clinicians use alternate-day dosing at the very end, but I need to caution that modeling suggests this may increase withdrawal risk due to occupancy fluctuation, so if used, it should be brief and at the lowest feasible dose with close monitoring [^6e70009b] [^eec222d8].

> Next, I should review special populations and risk modifiers. For older adults, slower tapers are prudent given sensitivity to withdrawal and comorbidities; for patients with anxiety disorders, longer maintenance before tapering and slower tapers are advised; for pregnancy and postpartum, coordinate timing with obstetric guidance and taper slowly to mitigate relapse and discontinuation symptoms; for adolescents, follow pediatric guidance for slow tapering and monitor closely for withdrawal and suicidality [^c76cabae] [^41637380] [^9268abf8] [^dc00daa8].

> I need to ensure robust monitoring and differentiation of withdrawal from relapse. Let me verify the symptom clusters and timeline: withdrawal typically begins within days of a dose change, includes somatic symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, and insomnia, and resolves with dose reinstitution; relapse unfolds over weeks and reflects return of the original disorder; I should use structured check-ins every 2–4 weeks during the taper and for at least 3 months after discontinuation, and I should educate patients to distinguish these patterns to avoid misattribution and unnecessary long-term medication [^439fb47d] [^d18cce85] [^6a324b8d].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of psychotherapy and shared decision-making. Adding CBT or MBCT during tapering improves discontinuation success and reduces relapse compared with tapering alone, and aligning the taper pace with patient preferences and prior withdrawal experiences improves adherence; I should document goals, risks, and contingency plans, and I should avoid rigid timelines, allowing pauses or slower decrements if symptoms emerge [^4f98f4e1] [^381244a6] [^6e70009b].

> Let me reconsider any overstatements. I initially thought "never use alternate-day dosing", but I should correct that: while modeling cautions against interval prolongation due to occupancy swings, in resource-limited settings with no liquid or splitting options, a very brief, end-stage alternate-day microdose may be acceptable if monitored closely; the key is to minimize time at subtherapeutic intervals and to prefer continuous low-dose tapering when possible [^eec222d8] [^6e70009b].

> Finally, I should confirm safety counseling and follow-up. Patients should be advised not to stop abruptly, to report emerging withdrawal or mood symptoms promptly, and to maintain close contact during the taper and for 3 months after discontinuation; if intolerable symptoms occur, I should resume the prior dose and restart the taper more slowly, and if multiple failed attempts occur, I should reassess diagnosis, comorbidities, and the need for ongoing treatment or alternative strategies [^439fb47d] [^ef991365] [^6e70009b].

Taper escitalopram 20 mg **slowly over 2–4 months** [^ef991365] to minimize withdrawal and relapse risk [^5121e25e]. Reduce the dose by **50% initially to 10 mg for 2–4 weeks**, then by **25% to 5 mg for 2–4 weeks**, then by **50% to 2.5 mg for 2–4 weeks**, and finally to **1 mg for 2–4 weeks** before stopping. If withdrawal symptoms occur, return to the prior dose and taper more slowly [^439fb47d]; consider switching to a longer half-life SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine) if tapering is not tolerated [^cd90f171]. Monitor for withdrawal, relapse, and suicidality throughout [^0224537f].

---

## Recommended tapering strategy

A **stepwise taper** reduces withdrawal and relapse risk:

| **Step** | **Dose reduction** | **New dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | 50% | 10 mg | 2–4 weeks |
| 2 | 25% | 5 mg | 2–4 weeks |
| 3 | 50% | 2.5 mg | 2–4 weeks |
| 4 | 60% | 1 mg | 2–4 weeks |

---

Total taper duration: **8–16 weeks**, individualized to tolerance and clinical status.

---

## Clinical rationale for gradual tapering

Gradual tapering is essential to mitigate **withdrawal symptoms** (dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, anxiety, insomnia) [^439fb47d] and to reduce relapse risk [^5121e25e]. Escitalopram's intermediate half-life (~27–32 hours) [^c51bba94] makes it more prone to withdrawal than fluoxetine but less than paroxetine or venlafaxine, supporting a cautious taper [^6a324b8d].

---

## Monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms

- **Monitor**: Regularly assess for withdrawal and relapse during each dose reduction [^439fb47d].
- **Manage**: If withdrawal occurs, return to the prior dose and taper more slowly [^439fb47d].
- **Switch**: Consider switching to fluoxetine (long half-life) if tapering is not tolerated [^cd90f171].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing tapering strategy

- **Duration of therapy**: Longer use may require slower tapers [^9cd48340].
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, bipolar disorder, or seizure disorders may need tailored tapers [^notfound].
- **Prior withdrawal**: History of withdrawal suggests slower tapering [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be counseled on **withdrawal symptoms**, the importance of adherence, and the need to avoid abrupt discontinuation [^0224537f]. They should also be advised to report emerging withdrawal or mood symptoms promptly [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Taper slowly**: Over 2–4 months, adjusting to tolerance [^ef991365].
- **Stepwise reductions**: 20 mg → 10 mg → 5 mg → 2.5 mg → 1 mg → stop.
- **Monitor**: For withdrawal, relapse, and suicidality throughout [^0224537f].
- **Adjust**: Return to prior dose and slow taper if withdrawal occurs [^439fb47d].
- **Consider switch**: To fluoxetine if tapering is not tolerated [^cd90f171].

---

A **slow, stepwise taper** of escitalopram 20 mg over 2–4 months, with close monitoring and individualized adjustments, is the safest strategy to minimize withdrawal and relapse.

Methods

The original study was conducted in 46 centers in 7 European countries from October 2003 to May 2005, in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki applicable at the time of the study. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committees and all patients gave written informed consent for participation. The methods and main results of the principal study have been described.

Design Overview

This relapse prevention study started with a 12-week open-label treatment period that was followed by a 24-week, randomised, double blind treatment period (Figure 1). During the initial open-label period, outpatients aged at least 65 years received escitalopram 10mg/day during the first week; the dose could be increased to 20mg/day at Week 2, based on the clinical judgement of the investigator. Subsequently the dose remained constant for the remaining open label period. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, patients who achieved remission, defined by a Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≤ 12, were eligible for randomisation to either continue escitalopram at their last fixed dose of 10 or 20mg/day, or to switch to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomised to placebo who were on 20 mg/day escitalopram during the open period received 10 mg/day escitalopram for the first week (Week 13) before receiving placebo for the remainder of the study. Non-remitters left the study and were treated at the physician's discretion.

Figure 1
Study design.

During the 24-week double-blind period (until taper at Week 36), study investigators regularly evaluated relapse symptoms. Relapse was defined either as a MADRS total score ≥ 22 at a single visit, or an unsatisfactory treatment effect (lack of efficacy), as judged by the local investigator. In order to capture all patients who could be considered to have relapsed, this definition was extended in a sensitivity analysis to include patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDE or who attempted suicide. Patients who relapsed were withdrawn from the study and were contacted for a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.

### Antidepressant tapering is not routine but could Be [^a0f02ca4]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When antidepressants are discontinued, severe withdrawal symptoms are possible. Some patients have few or no problems stopping, whereas others struggle. That struggle can be minimized or prevented with careful dose tapering. How often is that done?

Methods

Using 7years of medical records, we determined the percentage of patients who received a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant before it was discontinued, as an indicator of a deliberate taper.

Results

Over that period, 8.9% of patients had evidence of tapering. The percentage increased from 4.9% in 2014 to a plateau around 10% in the past 4 years.

Discussion

While reports of severe withdrawal are increasingly recognized and must be addressed, our data suggest that many patients can discontinue their antidepressants without a taper through the lowest dose. However, it is difficult to identify which patients will struggle without a careful taper. A "one-size-fits-all" taper approach is recommended, balancing the need for withdrawal prevention with the need to avoid unnecessary complexity for the majority of patients. The first decrement is key for all patients: it must go well. Thereafter many patients may accelerate but all should receive a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant.

### Current strategies for tapering psychiatric drugs: differing recommendations, impractical doses, and other barriers [^6e70009b]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While effective ways to prevent withdrawal symptoms from psychiatric drugs remain unclear, a highly accepted clinical approach for treatment discontinuation is to gradually reduce doses over time. The objective of this review is to gather the current strategies for tapering of psychiatric drugs described in the literature and guidelines in an attempt to identify the most promising one. Literature review and search for practice guidelines provided by government agencies and medical organizations were performed. Different strategies for tapering were found: linear tapering, hyperbolic tapering (by exponential dose reduction and pre-established dose-response curves), extended dosing, and substitution for a long half-life drug. The use of guidelines offers support for patients and prescribers, increasing the likelihood of achieving effective drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization found among the guidelines makes any attempt to reduce or stop the drug very difficult for prescribers. Hyperbolic tapering by exponential dose reduction appears to be the most promising strategy for psychiatric drug discontinuation. Yet, we still face a constant challenge: how to safely obtain flexible doses for the discontinuation of drugs, particularly during the last steps in which lower doses are required. Further studies are needed to reduce the barriers associated with psychiatric drug discontinuation.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^a8cf14be]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

### Escitalopram [^fb413df1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^c51bba94]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome

If the decision is to withdraw treatment, abrupt discontinuation of central serotonergic neuromodulators (mainly SSRIs and SNRIs) may be associated with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which consists of various symptoms, including nausea, headache, flulike symptoms, imbalance, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and sensory disturbance like brain zaps and paresthesia.

The ADS is more common using agents with a shorter half-life. So, for the SSRIs, paroxetine, with a half-life of less than a day, is more likely to produce ADS when stopped abruptly. By contrast, fluoxetine has a half-life of 3–4 days, and ADS is less common. Citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline are intermediate and exhibit half-lives of longer than a day but may still require a gradual taper to avoid the uncomfortable symptoms of ADS.

There is no clearly defined strategy for preventing and treating ADS symptoms, and patient attributions to the withdrawal must be considered. The patient who is hypervigilant to withdrawal effects is more likely to have difficulty withdrawing. In addition, when comorbidities such as major depression or anxiety disorders are present, cognitive behavioral therapy or other brain-gut behavior therapies should be used concurrently to supplement the loss of the use of the medication. In addition, self-care behavior interventions like mindfulness, relaxation, and supportive relationships explain up to 20%–30% of the variance in predicting successful discontinuation of the antidepressants.

Some strategies may be helpful. It is better to discontinue the morning dose for a week and then discontinue the evening dose. Another alternative is to switch to an agent with a longer half-life, like fluoxetine when planning to stop another antidepressant. However, in cases where symptoms are severe, sometimes it is necessary to reintroduce the neuromodulator and retry using a slower discontinuation process. Since the lowest dose of duloxetine is 20 mg, we sometimes advocate patients opening the capsule and taking half the dose (10 mg) when continuing the tapering protocol.

### Alternate-day dosing to taper antidepressants risks severe withdrawal effects: an in silico analysis [^eec222d8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians often recommend dosing antidepressants every other day when tapering to reduce 'average' daily doses. This is used in place of liquid formulations or other methods for obtaining smaller doses. There is limited evidence to support this approach. This paper explores variation of the inter-dose interval when tapering five widely used antidepressants: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, and mirtazapine. We analysed the resultant occupancy of relevant target receptors to establish whether prolonging the interval between doses would likely increase the risk of withdrawal symptoms.

Design and Methods

Analysis was conducted in silico using pre-existing pharmacokinetic data including bioavailability, distribution volumes, time to maximal concentration, and elimination half-lives. Modelling was conducted to assess the effect of altered administration frequency. Receptor occupancy was predicted using previous imaging data. We used pre-defined thresholds to evaluate the tolerability of receptor occupancy variation for different dosing strategies.

Results

Prolonging the inter-dose interval led to a pronounced increase in receptor occupancy variation at standard doses of all antidepressants. Variation increased as dosage reduced until the ED 50 for each drug, which is often far below doses used in current practice. Therefore, increasing the dose interval at minimum therapeutic doses, or even half of that dose, likely increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms and cannot be recommended as a prudent strategy for tapering.

Conclusion

Dosing every other day is likely to cause withdrawal effects with the antidepressants examined in this study. These recommendations remain theoretical until further clinical research and empirical validation of our proposed antidepressant tapering regimens.

### Incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a4d6f08f]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms are becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice, but the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms has not been quantified. An estimate of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms incidence could inform patients and clinicians in the discontinuation of treatment, and provide useful information to researchers in antidepressant treatments. We aimed to assess the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms in patients discontinuing both antidepressants and placebo in the published literature.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception until Oct 13, 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), other controlled trials, and observational studies assessing the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms. To be included, studies must have investigated cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant drug (excluding antipsychotics, lithium, or thyroxine) or placebo in participants with any mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder. We excluded studies in neonates, and those using antidepressants for physical conditions such as pain syndromes due to organic disease. After study selection, summary data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation, data were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. The main outcome was the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of antidepressants or placebo. We also analysed the incidence of severe discontinuation symptoms. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses tested a selection of methodological variables.

Findings

From 6095 articles screened, 79 studies (44 RCTs and 35 observational studies) covering 21002 patients were selected (72% female, 28% male, mean age 45 years [range 19.6–64.5]). Data on ethnicity were not consistently reported. 16532 patients discontinued from an antidepressant, and 4470 patients discontinued from placebo. Incidence of at least one antidepressant discontinuation symptom was 0.31 (95% CI 0.27–0.35) in 62 study groups after discontinuation of antidepressants, and 0.17 (0.14–0.21) in 22 study groups after discontinuation of placebo. Between antidepressant and placebo groups of included RCTs, the summary difference in incidence was 0.08 [0.04–0.12]. The incidence of severe antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of an antidepressant was 0.028 (0.014–0.057) compared with 0.006 (0.002–0.013) after discontinuation of placebo. Desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine, and escitalopram were associated with higher frequencies of discontinuation symptoms, and imipramine, paroxetine, and either desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine were associated with a higher severity of symptoms. Heterogeneity of results was substantial.

Interpretation

Considering non-specific effects, as evidenced in placebo groups, the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms is approximately 15%, affecting one in six to seven patients who discontinue their medication. Subgroup analyses and heterogeneity figures point to factors not accounted for by diagnosis, medication, or trial-related characteristics, and might indicate subjective factors on the part of investigators, patients, or both. Residual or re-emerging psychopathology needs to be considered when interpreting the results, but our findings can inform clinicians and patients about the probable extent of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms without causing undue alarm.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^1c46d13c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another possible explanation of these results is that the short-term discontinuation required to enter in the trial disturbed the stability previously acquired with medications, generating discontinuation symptoms. In support of this hypothesis, discontinuers showed an increase in depressive symptoms between trial screening and baseline (i.e. when withdrawal was taking place), as well as a trend towards higher depression scores at baseline compared with unmedicated patients. Tapering or cessation of SSRI/SNRIs is commonly associated with withdrawal symptoms which often resemble symptoms of depression or a worsening of depressive symptom severity. These symptoms can be distinguished from a relapse of the original disorder by rapidity of onset, the presence of somatic symptoms like nausea, shock-like feelings, dizziness and rapid response by reintroduction of SSRI/SNRIs. While a minimum of 2 weeks of tapering is commonly considered sufficient, it may not mitigate prolonged symptoms. In fact, there is evidence suggesting that linear tapering over this period might not have additional benefit compared with abrupt discontinuation.

### Understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs [^5b0f9aa1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of treatment, APA 2010 guidelines recommend to consider offering a slow taper or temporary change to a longer half-life antidepressant to reduce the risk of discontinuation syndrome when discontinuing antidepressants or reducing antidepressant doses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^43fe8d78]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP guideline — SSRI switching, monitoring, discontinuation, and treatment duration in children and adolescents with depressive disorders notes that there is "no definitive empirical guidance for switching from one SSRI to another", and while tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second (with a fluoxetine washout) is the most conservative strategy, "Cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored". When a concerning adverse effect could be linked to medication, the dose "would be reduced", and if it persists, the medication "would be discontinued", with monitoring recommended and "no specific laboratory tests" in the absence of relevant comorbidities. For continuation, a generally accepted approach is to continue an effective dose for "approximately 6 to 12 months after remission", with discontinuation "during a relatively stress-free period", and longer maintenance "from more than 1 year to several years or longer" in higher-risk presentations. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or abrupt stopping of short-acting SSRIs "notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline", warranting "close adherence… and a slow discontinuation taper", whereas "fluoxetine… is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome" and has not shown withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed.

To our knowledge, based on a systematic review, no consistent empirical evidence links patient characteristics to predicting DS, including residual symptoms, number of prior episodes, and duration of antidepressant use. Length of antidepressant use has been suggested to be a risk factor for some antidepressants, though the data are inconsistent. Possible predictors of relapse following discontinuation are effort-reward decision time and cognitive reactivity, the latter being the most consistent predictor independent of residual symptoms. However, these predictors have not been firmly established.

When to discontinue?

Most guidelines recommend to continue antidepressants for at least 4–6 months after successful acute-phase therapy in patients with first-episode MDD to prevent relapse, and longer periods after recurrent MDD. Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting a minimum duration of antidepressant treatment after stable remission. Patients with recurrent MDD should stay on treatment longer and sometimes indefinitely.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Consensus supports slow discontinuation of antidepressants, but few randomized studies have compared discontinuation strategies. Most studies employ a rather rapid 2-week tapering period with at most two steps. Compared to abrupt discontinuation, 1–3-week tapering schedules lower DS frequency. Although hyperbolic tapering, which involves decreasing relative dose reductions over time (Supplementary Text), is supported by expert opinion, it lacks evidence. Given the heterogeneity of DS between antidepressants and individual patient variation, general advice would be to slowly taper in those taking antidepressants for longer periods of time (e.g. years), and antidepressants with higher DS risk.

Dose reduction

A meta-analysis of five randomized trials found that dose reductions of phenelzine, maprotiline, imipramine, amineptine, and paroxetine increased the risk of MDD relapse by 62% relative to the group randomized to unchanged continuation.

Discontinuation interventions

A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in time to depression relapse between patients receiving psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) during or after antidepressant tapering, compared to those who continued with antidepressant maintenance therapy only. Another meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed that MDD patients receiving psychotherapy during antidepressant treatment or tapering had a lower rate of relapse compared to those receiving active controls (antidepressant treatment) or treatment as usual. In conclusion, a (preventive) psychotherapy is as effective as antidepressant maintenance.

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^78a91f0c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The results of the search strategy are outlined in Figure 1. We identified a total of 6869 articles from our literature search. After accounting for duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, we screened 56 full-text articles for inclusion in this review. Following the full-text screen, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Articles written in a non-English language were included for screening, but none was eligible for inclusion (Table 1).

Table 1.
Characteristics of included studies.

Of the 12 included studies, 10 expressed numbers of patients 'responsive' after reinstating antidepressant treatment. Of these 10 studies, 5 included no tapering of antidepressant dose when discontinuing the antidepressant. Nine included studies examined the treatment of depression (as it was defined at the time of each study), one OCD, one dysthymia and one social phobia with GAD.

Narrative description of included studies

This was a multisite double-blind placebo-controlled RCT in patients with major depressive disorder. Patients who responded to 60 mg duloxetine after 12 weeks of treatment were randomised to placebo or continuation with duloxetine. In the placebo group, the dose of duloxetine was reduced to 30 mg for 1 week and then stopped. Rescue treatment at the previous dose of duloxetine was used if a relapse occurred. Overall, 26% of patients relapsed and then did not respond to reinstated duloxetine.

This was a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of responders to fluoxetine 20 mg a day. Those randomised to placebo had fluoxetine abruptly stopped, and restarted if a relapse occurred. Overall, 11% of participants did not respond at all to fluoxetine on reinstatement after relapse, and 25% of those who previously maintained a response in the initial treatment episode did not maintain a response after restarting treatment.

### Predictors of successful discontinuation of antipsychotics and antidepressants [^bc2b3a12]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The discontinuation strategy was also relevant to success, but this effect was less straightforward. Although a gradual strategy is generally recommended (Horowitz et al; Horowitz & Taylor; NICE,), we did not find that a gradual approach per se (v. abrupt) predicted discontinuation success. In fact - even after controlling for other variables – we found that those who reduced AD all at once were more likely to achieve full discontinuation. Among those who worked with a tapering plan to discontinue AD, leaving time between steps reduced the negative effects but rendered it less likely to reach full discontinuation. In contrast, faster tapering increased the chance of full discontinuation, which is also reflected in the higher self-reported success scores. Given that this finding does not align with clinical observations and previous research that indicates gradual withdrawal to be advantageous (Baldessarini et al; Groot & van Os,) the limitations of the non-randomized design and the putative interaction effects noted above require particular attention. For instance, it is possible that the effect is driven by a group of patients with milder psychopathology or a short duration of medication intake. This calls for more studies on moderating effects. Nevertheless, the findings question the notion that gradual withdrawal is better per se. The overall pattern of findings also indicates that what may constitute a successful tapering strategy for AD depends on whether more value is placed on being off medication quickly or on preventing negative effects. It could thus be helpful to discuss these differential effects with patients in the context of a shared decision-making process.

### The relationship between dose and serotonin transporter occupancy of antidepressants-a systematic review [^7f9da8f4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

As one postulated working mechanism of many antidepressants is serotonin reuptake inhibition via blockade of SERT, PET and SPECT imaging studies may potentially provide mechanistic insight into important clinical aspects of antidepressant treatment relevant to both the effectiveness of the treatment but also symptoms that may arise during tapering or discontinuation of the treatment. The efficacy of antidepressant treatment for depression is modest compared with placebo and many patients may need additional treatment or treatment adjustments. Common treatment strategies in patients with depression for whom antidepressant treatment has not been effective include increasing the antidepressant dose or switching to a different antidepressant; such strategies may, however, also largely be ineffective. Although a relation between SERT occupancy and clinical improvement in depressive symptoms has not been shown, knowledge about the relationship between antidepressant dose and SERT occupancy, as well as overlapping actions on SERT between different antidepressants, may be able to provide some mechanistic insight into the apparently limited effectiveness of the above treatment strategies. Approximately half of the patients stopping or reducing the dose of antidepressants experience withdrawal symptoms, which, among others, may include flu-like symptoms, anxiety, emotional lability, lowering of mood, and irritability. As one postulated mechanism underlying antidepressant withdrawal symptoms is a rapid decrease in SERT occupancy arising when antidepressants are tapered or stopped, a clearer understanding of the SERT occupancy at specific, especially lower, doses may provide essential mechanistic information for understanding the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. Given the paucity of evidence for specific tapering regimens, this could perhaps offer insights into better approaches to mitigate withdrawal symptoms. The potential utility of the dose/occupancy relationship in guiding tapering to mitigate withdrawal symptoms has received recent interest by multiple groups, and was considered in a recent Cochrane review on approaches to antidepressant discontinuation and in a recent iteration of a major guideline on the management of patients with mood disorders.

While several individual studies have investigated the relationship between dose and SERT occupancy of antidepressants, this evidence has not been systematically reviewed, which we, therefore, aimed to do. Our primary objective was to determine the relationship between the dose and SERT occupancy measured with highly selective radioligands for antidepressants. In studies that repeated measurements of SERT occupancy over time after discontinuation, we additionally aimed to determine the SERT occupancy decline rate and relate it to the plasma concentration decline rate.

### Risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation in anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis of relapse prevention trials [^22364029]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In anxiety disorders, chronic course trajectories and relapses after remission are common. Consequently, when combined with high prevalence rates and functional limitations, anxiety disorders score highly on burden of disease rankings. Optimising the long term prognosis, including prevention of relapse, is an important strategy to decrease the burden of disease related to anxiety.

In addition to cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressants are a first line option for the treatment of anxiety disorders, as they are effective and generally well tolerated. Most (57%) patients with anxiety disorders who are being treated use drugs. As long term studies are scarce, whether antidepressants should also be regarded a first line treatment option for optimising long term prognosis remains largely unknown. International guidelines are therefore consensus based and advise continuation of treatment for variable durations (six to 24 months) and subsequent tapering of the antidepressant. In contrast to the guidelines' advice, long term use is increasing, with nearly half of patients in the UK and approximately two thirds of those in the US continuing antidepressants for at least two years. Whether clinicians are unnecessarily medicalising their patients or whether guidelines are too optimistic by advising discontinuation of antidepressants after sustained remission remains unclear. This discrepancy calls for clarity regarding long term use of antidepressants: is discontinuation of antidepressants wise?

A previous meta-analysis, including studies up to 2008, reported that relapse occurred in 26–45% of patients with anxiety disorder who discontinued antidepressants. Continuing antidepressants seemed to be effective in preventing relapse, with protective summary odds ratios ranging from 0.20 to 0.38 in various anxiety disorders. Superiority of antidepressants to placebo was also shown for quality of life.

Information on whether specific treatment or discontinuation strategies influence risk of relapse is scant and inconclusive. For example, whereas some studies reported fewer relapses when antidepressants were discontinued after sustained use, others reported that relapses occurred frequently when antidepressants were stopped after a prolonged period of use. Likewise, we do not know whether risk of relapse depends on the type of antidepressant, the mode of discontinuation (abrupt versus tapered), the duration of follow-up, and whether concomitant psychotherapy is allowed or whether comorbidity affects relapse risk after discontinuation of antidepressants.

### Escitalopram continuation treatment prevents relapse of depressive episodes [^dde07207]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for antidepressant use recommend 4 to 6 months of continuation treatment to prevent relapse of depression following symptom resolution. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of continuation escitalopram treatment.

Method

Outpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (male or female, aged 18 to 81 years) who had completed 8 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment with escitalopram, citalopram, or placebo entered an 8-week flexible-dose, open-label phase in which all patients received escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). This study was initiated November 3, 1999, and completed April 5, 2001. Patients who met responder criteria (score of ≤ 12 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to escitalopram (at the dose each patient was receiving at the end of the open-label phase) or placebo for 36 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to depression relapse (defined as MADRS score ≥ 22 or discontinuation due to an insufficient therapeutic response) from the start of the double-blind treatment phase.

Results

A total of 502 patients received open-label escitalopram treatment and had at least 1 MADRS assessment. A total of 274 evaluable subjects entered the double-blind treatment phase; 93 received placebo and 181 received escitalopram. Time to depression relapse was significantly longer (p = .013) and the cumulative rate of relapse was significantly lower in patients who received escitalopram (26% escitalopram vs. 40% placebo; hazard ratio = 0.56; p = .01). Escitalopram-treated subjects had significantly lower depression ratings than those of placebo-treated patients. Escitalopram continuation treatment was safe and well tolerated. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 7% for the placebo group and 4% for the escitalopram-treated group.

Conclusion

Continuation treatment with escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse into an episode of major depressive disorder.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^787ddb97]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Patients on low-dose prescription opioids (< 20 mg oral morphine equivalents) and/or for a short duration (< 2–3 weeks) can generally discontinue without tapering. In other patients, tapering is advised. More rapid tapering generally results in more severe withdrawal and lower success rates. The advised rate of discontinuation in guidelines ranges between 10% per month and 50% per week of the initial dose, with slower tapers (i.e. 10% reduction per month) being more likely to be better tolerated. If rapid discontinuation of opioids is necessary for medical reasons, reduction strategies of up to 50% per week are possible. Switching to long-acting opioids (usually 70% dose-equivalent) can be considered with high doses (> 90 mg morphine equivalents) and/or prolonged opioid use (> 3 months), but also in patients with prior failed discontinuation attempts. Long-acting opioids should be tapered to the lowest possible dose, and then discontinued.

Dose reduction

Discontinuation should be the primary goal in patients using opioids for analgesic purposes. Nevertheless, in patients at high risk of relapse (high opioid doses, long-time use, either with or without opioid use disorder), long-acting opioid agonist treatment (e.g. methadone or buprenorphine) can be considered. In patients on agonist treatment, dose reduction strategies are recommended when adverse events develop, or in the event of pharmacokinetic changes, e.g. due to co-medication, successful treatment of hepatitis, or ageing.

Discontinuation interventions

Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with opioid use disorder result in lower perceived pain and focus on analgesics. Such strategies may facilitate discontinuation of opioids, although evidence is lacking. There is limited evidence for clonidine for agitation, shaking and muscle ache, anti-emetics for nausea, and loperamide for diarrhea. For insomnia, benzodiazepines should be given with caution in this patient group, due to their risk of developing sedative use disorder.

### Guidelines for adolescent depression in primary care (GLAD-PC): part II. treatment and ongoing management [^dc00daa8]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment — indications, dosing cautions, approvals, and monitoring specify that when indicated by clinical presentation (ie, clear diagnosis of MDD with no comorbid conditions) and patient and/or family preference, an SSRI should be used, and once the antidepressant is started, and if tolerated, the clinician should support an adequate trial up to the maximum dose and duration. Deliberate self-harm and/or suicide risk is more likely to occur if the SSRI is started at higher doses (rather than normal starting doses), so the patient and family should be informed about these possible adverse effects (clinicians may use checklist), including possible switch to mania or the development of behavioral activation or suicide-related events. Generally, the effective dosages for antidepressants in adolescents are lower than would be found in adult guidelines; note that only fluoxetine has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents with depression, and only escitalopram has been approved for use in adolescents aged 12 years and older. Clinicians should know the potential drug interactions with SSRIs, and in addition, all SSRIs should be slowly tapered when discontinued because of risk of withdrawal effects. Because medication RCTs for depression in adolescents generally only included subjects with MDD, medication-specific guidelines apply only to fully expressed MDD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^be9118f0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

### The effect of rate of antidepressant tapering on the incidence of discontinuation symptoms: a randomised study [^c1e90798]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty eight patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors /venlafaxine were randomized to a three-day (short) or 14-day (longer) anti-depressant taper and openly assessed after a five to seven day drug-free washout, and again after seven days treatment with a new anti-depressant of the treating clinician's choice. A 'discontinuation syndrome' (≥ 3 new symptoms on the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms checklist) occurred in 46% of patients with a similar frequency in those with short (7/15) versus longer (6/13) taper. Patients initially on short half-life anti-depressants had significantly greater increases in discontinuation and depressive symptoms than those stopping fluoxetine. Four patients, all on paroxetine, developed emergent suicidal ideation after taper. These results support the importance of half-life in determining discontinuation symptoms and suggest that there is little advantage to a two-week taper over a three-day taper when switching antidepressants. Antidepressant discontinuation in depressed patients can be associated with worsening depression and increased suicidality.

### Predictors of successful discontinuation of antipsychotics and antidepressants [^fb09c4ce]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation strategy

The strategy of discontinuation was assessed with a self-developed two-part questionnaire. The first part assessed whether the participant had sought information and prepared the discontinuation attempt (preparation, three items, e.g. 'I made preparations before starting to discontinue', see Supplement 1, Table S1), and had followed a tapering plan (three items, e.g. 'I followed a detailed plan on how to reduce my medication', see Supplement 1, Table S1). Participants indicating to have followed a tapering plan (n = 247) were asked whether their plan included adjustment phases following each reduction step (two items, e.g. 'I only continued discontinuation when I felt stable enough with the current dosage', see Supplement 1 Table S2) and whether it allowed for a flexible change of the dose (two items, e.g. 'I followed my gut feeling when discontinuing', see Supplement 1, Table S2). Furthermore, participants described their pacing by selecting one out of eight different types of recommended tapering strategies (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziale Psychiatrie; Hall,), ranging from slow (< 10% reduction of the most recent dose every 4–6 weeks) to fast (> 50% reduction or more of the most recent dose every 2–4 weeks).

For the items assessing preparation and tapering, principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) supported the two-factor-model, with sufficient model fit in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA): CFI = 0.991, RMSEA = 0.060, SRMR = 0.030, loadings: 0.634–0.952. For the items adjustment phases and flexible change, PCA yielded two components with eigenvalues above 1. CFA indicated a pattern of largely standardized loadings (loadings: 0.318–0.950; see Supplement 1 for details on both factor analyses). The variable pacing was dichotomized to 0 = 'slow' (< 10% reduction every 4–6 weeks, n = 48) and 1 = 'medium or fast' (> 10% reduction every 4–6 weeks, n = 144).

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^3e7ff2e1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations that should be considered in interpreting these results. First is the small and unequal sample sizes and the exploratory, post hoc, opportunistic nature of the analyses. As such, these results should not be taken as confirmatory – rather, they may be used to inform hypothesis testing in well controlled future studies. Aside from there being a 2-week washout period at the end of tapering, the length of each medication taper was not collected during the trial and formal assessments of withdrawal symptoms were not performed, so it was not possible to include this information in our analyses. The samples that discontinued or were unmedicated at the start of the trial might have differed in other fundamental ways. For example, discontinuers may represent a more treatment-resistant form of MDD, given that they were already treated with an antidepressant medication and sought to be enrolled in a clinical trial focused on a different treatment. There is also the possibility that the unmedicated were unmedicated because they had negative expectations for SSRI/SNRIs – causing them to be primed for a negative response to escitalopram if they were allocated to that arm. Accordingly, demographic information suggests that the number of psychiatric medications previously used was higher in discontinuers than in the unmedicated. The discontinuation group also discontinued other psychiatric medications at the start of the study (see for a complete list of these medications), and this could have impacted outcomes. Finally, it is important to note that both treatment groups benefited from extensive psychological support, with an approach inspired by the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model. The therapeutic effects derived from the support cannot thus be separated from the effects of the drugs in any of the trial arms, and likely acted synergistically to enhance both psilocybin's and escitalopram's effects.

### Tapering of SSRI treatment to mitigate withdrawal symptoms [^ef991365]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

All classes of drug that are prescribed to treat depression are associated with withdrawal syndromes. SSRI withdrawal syndrome occurs often and can be severe, and might compel patients to recommence their medication. Although the withdrawal syndrome can be differentiated from recurrence of the underlying disorder, it might also be mistaken for recurrence, leading to long-term unnecessary medication. Guidelines recommend short tapers, of between 2 weeks and 4 weeks, down to therapeutic minimum doses, or half-minimum doses, before complete cessation. Studies have shown that these tapers show minimal benefits over abrupt discontinuation, and are often not tolerated by patients. Tapers over a period of months and down to doses much lower than minimum therapeutic doses have shown greater success in reducing withdrawal symptoms. Other types of medication associated with withdrawal, such as benzodiazepenes, are tapered to reduce their biological effect at receptors by fixed amounts to minimise withdrawal symptoms. These dose reductions are done with exponential tapering programmes that reach very small doses. This method could have relevance for tapering of SSRIs. We examined the PET imaging data of serotonin transporter occupancy by SSRIs and found that hyperbolically reducing doses of SSRIs reduces their effect on serotonin transporter inhibition in a linear manner. We therefore suggest that SSRIs should be tapered hyperbolically and slowly to doses much lower than those of therapeutic minimums, in line with tapering regimens for other medications associated with withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms will then be minimised.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^cc60d03d]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To assess and clarify the relations between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dose efficacy, acceptability (early treatment discontinuation (dropouts)), and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects), and critically evaluate methods previously used to examine SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults.

Design

Systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration library, from 1975 to December 2021. Reference lists of national depression treatment guidelines were systemically searched by hand.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults (age ≥ 18 years) reporting efficacy, acceptability, or tolerability. Reviews meeting inclusion criteria had a high degree of heterogeneity, due to methodological diversity; therefore, a meta-narrative synthesis approach was applied. Standard daily doses were defined as 20mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50mg sertraline; and 10mg escitalopram. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations.

Results

The search identified 9138 records; 387 full text reports were assessed for eligibility, 42 of which matched the inclusion criteria. The majority, 83% (n = 35), of reviews included data for studies with a duration of ≤ 12 weeks (ie, the acute phase of depression treatment). Of 39 reviews assessing efficacy, the majority (n = 26) indicated that individual SSRIs and SSRI class demonstrated flat dose-response effects; standard doses were optimal for efficacy. Acceptability or tolerability were assessed in 28 reviews. Higher than standard daily doses were associated with higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of adverse drug effects (eg, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety). Despite a range of methods being reported, there was an overall consensus regarding SSRI dose related efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects.

Conclusion

Standard daily doses of SSRIs for the treatment of depression in adults provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Patients are encouraged to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatments.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^41637380]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — first-line pharmacotherapy is specified as follows: ACOG recommends that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be used as first-line psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal anxiety, with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as reasonable alternatives, and pharmacotherapy individualized based on prior response; if there is no pharmacotherapy history, sertraline or escitalopram are reasonable first-line medications. Most experts recommend initiation of SSRIs or SNRIs for anxiety at half of the lowest recommended dose range to avoid early side effects such as agitation or insomnia, and treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related conditions often requires up-titration to doses that are higher than those for depression; experts also recommend that individuals with anxiety and anxiety-related conditions be in remission longer than those with an indication of depression before considering tapering or discontinuing psychopharmacotherapy.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^d6e936a2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

As is standard practice in psychedelic trials, participants in thestudy, who were taking SSRI/SNRIs at screening, were required to discontinue prior to commencing the study. This practice is due to some overlap in serotonergic pharmacology of SSRI/SNRIs and psilocybin (i.e. both cause elevated stimulation of 5-HT receptors) as well as an absence of established safety data for combined treatment – at least at the time of conducting the present study. Additionally, previous case reports have indicated that long-term administration of SSRI/SNRIs can reduce the therapeutically important subjective effects of psychedelics. In accordance with guidelines set forth by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE;) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, SSRI/SNRI tapering in this study was done gradually for a period of 2–4 weeks with linear reductions to minimize withdrawal symptoms. There was at least a two-week (or 5 half-lives) drug-free washout period before study commencement, and participants were required to remain abstinent from the medication for the duration of the trial. Once the trial was complete, participants could re-start antidepressant medication under the guidance of their main care provider, typically their general practitioner (GP). This process has been found to be safe and effective (i.e. no serious adverse events) in clinical trials thus far.

### Escitalopram treatment of kleptomania: an open-label trial followed by double-blind discontinuation [^3f99c965]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Kleptomania has no definitive treatment. Mixed reports of benefit from openly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors led us to design a double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial of escitalopram.

Method

Between December 2002 and March 2005, we recruited 24 subjects aged ≥ 20 years with DSM-IV kleptomania of ≥ 1 year's duration. We excluded subjects with organic mental disorders, psychoses, substance or alcohol abuse, suicidal risk, bipolar I or II disorder, anorexia nervosa, or antisocial personality disorder and subjects requiring other psychotropic medications. Our primary outcome measure was theft episodes per week. A responder was defined as a subject having a > 50% decrease in theft episodes per week and a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale score of "much improved" or "very much improved". Escitalopram was started at 10 mg/day and increased as necessary and tolerated after week 4 to 20 mg/day. At the end of week 7, responders were randomly assigned to a 1-week taper followed by 16 weeks of placebo or to continuation of treatment for 17 weeks at their week 7 escitalopram dose.

Results

Nineteen subjects (79%) were week 7 responders and 15 were randomly assigned. Five subjects (4 responders) withdrew early: 1 for unrelated illness, 1 for protocol deviation, 2 for side effects, and 1 for withdrawn consent. Three (43%) of 7 escitalopram subjects relapsed compared with 4 (50%) of 8 placebo subjects (Fisher exact test p = .38).

Conclusion

The high response rate during open-label escitalopram treatment was not better maintained by double-blind escitalopram than by placebo. Kleptomania may be a heterogeneous pathological behavior better treated with pharma-cotherapy in some cases and psychologically or with combined treatment in others.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^82709b34]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient safety during tapering without consent — communication, documentation, and monitoring steps include that when initiating a taper without a patient's consent, clinicians should carefully explain the reasons for their decision to the patient and their care partners, if applicable, and clinicians should also carefully document the rationale for initiating the taper and related discussions. Clinicians should then explain to patients that their next prescription will be at a lower dose and describe how they will monitor and manage patient symptoms and concerns during the tapering process, and the tapering process should be patient-centered. It is important for clinicians to closely monitor a patient's response to the taper and adjust the strategy as appropriate. Clinicians should be mindful of any potential bias when initiating a taper against a patient's wishes, and if clinicians and patients and their care partners continue to disagree on the need for a taper after this discussion, clinicians may consider referral for a second opinion. The CGC noted that some patients may become aggressive, threaten legal action, or suggest that progressing with the taper may lead them to suicide, and the CGC recommends that healthcare systems have established policies and procedures to guide clinicians in their response to these situations in ways that are responsive to a patient's needs and supports ready access to risk management services.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^6a324b8d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation evidence across psychotropic medication classes

In the following section, we examine the three key clinical discontinuation questions (summarized in Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the major discontinuation evidence across medication classes.

Antidepressants

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Continuing antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who responded to acute treatment halves the relapse risk compared to placebo (from 40 to 20%), in both specialized and primary care. The most recent meta-analysis on this topic found that the number needed to treat (NNT) was 6, favouring continuation of antidepressants. A landmark study pointed in the same direction in the context of primary care. An important limitation of double-blind placebo-controlled discontinuation studies is their relatively short follow-up period (study duration averaging 40 weeks) and often rapid or abrupt antidepressant discontinuation, although the absolute relapse risk gradually decreases over time in discontinued patients.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

DS of antidepressants include a range of somatic (e.g. nausea, dizziness) and psychological (e.g. irritability, low mood) symptoms, and are summarized using the FINISH acronym, which stands for Flu-like symptoms, Insomnia, Nausea, Imbalance, Sensory disturbances, and Hyperarousal (anxiety/agitation). DS in SSRIs were found to be higher in both surveys of selected populations and open-label studies (55%), than in double-blind studies (30%), possibly due to smaller nocebo effects in double-blind studies and selection bias in surveys. DS especially occur during treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs that have relatively short elimination half-lives (< 24 h), such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, though other mechanisms unrelated to elimination contribute as well. For example, paroxetine has strong affinity for the M 1 receptor and also inhibits its own metabolism (just like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine). Abrupt discontinuation leads to higher DS incidence rates (35–100%) compared to tapering over several weeks (42–56%) for paroxetine. Conversely, fluoxetine has an elimination half-life of around 5 days (active metabolite 4–16 days), and is generally associated with fewer DS. It is hypothesized that most DS coincide with the largest reductions in serotonin transporter (SERT) occupancy, which particularly occur at lower doses. DS generally quickly resolve after dose increases or reinstatement of the antidepressant, which can aid in distinguishing DS from relapse.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^04109461]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tapering strategies underscore that BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients likely to have developed physical dependence and at risk of significant withdrawal symptoms, and most existing clinical guidance documents emphasize the importance of gradual dose reductions to discontinue BZD use in these patients.

### Managing antidepressant discontinuation: a systematic review [^4f98f4e1]. Annals of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of interventions to manage antidepressant discontinuation, and the outcomes for patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review with narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of studies published to March 2017. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, or observational studies assessing interventions to facilitate discontinuation of antidepressants for depression in adults. Our primary outcomes were antidepressant discontinuation and discontinuation symptoms. Secondary outcomes were relapse/recurrence; quality of life; antidepressant reduction; and sexual, social, and occupational function.

Results

Of 15 included studies, 12 studies (8 randomized controlled trials, 2 single-arm trials, 2 retrospective cohort studies) were included in the synthesis. None were rated as having high risk for selection or detection bias. Two studies prompting primary care clinician discontinuation with antidepressant tapering guidance found 6% and 7% of patients discontinued, vs 8% for usual care. Six studies of psychological or psychiatric treatment plus tapering reported cessation rates of 40% to 95%. Two studies reported a higher risk of discontinuation symptoms with abrupt termination. At 2 years, risk of relapse/recurrence was lower with cognitive behavioral therapy plus taper vs clinical management plus taper (15% to 25% vs 35% to 80%: risk ratio = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18–0.67; 2 studies). Relapse/recurrence rates were similar for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with tapering and maintenance antidepressants (44% to 48% vs 47% to 60%; 2 studies).

Conclusions

Cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can help patients discontinue antidepressants without increasing the risk of relapse/recurrence, but are resource intensive. More scalable interventions incorporating psychological support are needed.

### Postpartum depression recurrence versus discontinuation syndrome: observations from a randomized controlled trial [^dd4cea81]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To differentiate characteristics of a discontinuation syndrome from a recurrence of major depressive disorder in the context of a randomized trial.

Method

We performed a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of sertraline versus placebo for the prevention of recurrent postpartum DSM-IV major depressive disorder. Women whose depression did not recur in the initial 17-week active treatment trial were followed through the taper phase (weeks 18–20). At week 17, 3 women assigned to placebo and 8 assigned to sertraline remained in the trial. Nine symptoms that characterize discontinuation syndrome were extracted from the 25-item Asberg Rating Scale for Side Effects (ASE) and assessed weekly during the taper phase. The 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to evaluate depressive symptoms.

Results

In the taper phase, there were no significant differences between the sertraline- and placebo-treated women on the sum of the ASE-derived symptoms. Both groups had low levels of symptoms on the ASE during the weeks of taper. None of the 3 women assigned to placebo and 2 of the 8 women assigned to sertraline suffered a depressive recurrence within 6 weeks of the end of the study.

Conclusions

A gradual taper of sertraline (75 mg) over 3 weeks did not lead to discontinuation syndrome; however, the systematic dissection of symptoms resulted in our conclusion that the duration of preventive therapy should be extended to 26 weeks (about 6 months) in subsequent randomized trials, consistent with the treatment guidelines for a single episode of depression.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome… [^8ee4c019]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Prevention and management USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS For optimal treatment of most psychiatric conditions, and especially anxiety and depressive disorders, psychosocial interventions should be recommended along with or considered as alternatives to pharmacologic therapies. The all-too-common practice of "short-term" prescriptions for off-label, non–mental health reasons has been associated with early antidepressant discontinuation and may increase the risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.
31. PATIENTS AT RISK OF DISCONTINUATION Patients may be tempted to discontinue their antidepressant medication after they begin to feel better, a practice that invites both early relapse of illness and antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Women may discontinue antidepressant use after discovering that they are pregnant.

Ideally, patients should be counseled regarding the risks of illness relapse, the importance of treating symptoms to remission, the need for continuation and maintenance pharmacotherapy, and the need for gradual discontinuation of medications before discontinuing care. 27, 32. DISCONTINUING MEDICATION Although there are no clinical trials comparing abrupt discontinuation with tapered discontinuation of antidepressants, tapering is recommended by experts, based on the suspected pathophysiology of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. It may be possible to stop fluoxetine therapy without tapering. There are no clear, validated tapering recommendations. However, Table 5 27 offers one expert's recommendations for tapering rates. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication.

MANAGEMENT If antidepressant discontinuation syndrome occurs and other serious causes of these symptoms have been ruled out, the physician should begin by providing reassurance to the patient that the condition is reversible, is not serious or life threatening, and will run its course within one to two weeks. The physician should then consider restarting the antidepressant medication with a slow dose taper or providing support if the patient desires not to restart the antidepressant. Severe symptoms should resolve in fewer than three days, and often within 24 hours. If the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome occurs during a tapering of the antidepressant, consider restarting at the original dose and then taper at a slower rate. In cases where slow tapering is poorly tolerated, a medicine with a longer half-life such as fluoxetine may be substituted for the shorter half-life agent.

### Escitalopram (Lexapro) [^c79505bd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.000000000000000e+00 6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.000000000000000e+00 7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Lexapro. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Lexapro before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Different levels of lack of improvement at 4 weeks of escitalopram treatment as predictors of poor 8-week outcome in MDD [^dfdb0630]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Several post-hoc studies have shown that lack of early improvement reduces the chance of later response or remission. This post-hoc analysis evaluates different cut-off points of non-improvement at 4 weeks of escitalopram treatment to predict 8-week non-response and non-remission.

Method

This study consisted of MDD patients with an absence of improvement (< 30% reduction in baseline score of the HAMD-17) at Week 4 of escitalopram treatment (10mg/day) that continued escitalopram treatment (10-20mg/day) for a further 4-week period (n = 251). Predictive, sensitivity and specificity values for the several definitions of non-improvement (≤ 25%, ≤ 20% and ≤ 15% reduction in the HAMD-17 baseline total score) at 4 weeks were calculated.

Results

Overall, 70.1% (176/251) of patients did not achieve response at Week 8 and 84.5% (212/251) did not achieve remission. The predictive value for non-response was high (71.4–74.3%) for all cut-off points of non-improvement tested. The respective values for non-remission were placed between 85.0% and 87.2%.

Limitations

This was a post-hoc subgroup analysis. The only drug assessed was escitalopram.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that an absence of improvement, < 30% reduction in the HAMD-17, after 4 weeks of escitalopram treatment should prompt clinicians to consider a change in treatment strategy. Similar findings were previously reported for other antidepressants.

### Approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long-term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults [^5121e25e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long-term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long-term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence-based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high-certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long-term antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long-term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults.

Search Methods

We searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were successful discontinuation rate, relapse (as defined by authors of the original study), withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. Abrupt discontinuation Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. None of these studies included successful discontinuation rate as a primary endpoint. Discontinuation by "taper" Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by "tapering" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that "tapered" discontinuation may lead to higher risk of relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. Discontinuation with psychological support Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with "tapering" may result in successful discontinuation rates of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. Low-certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms were not measured. Pooling data on adverse events was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). Discontinuation with minimal intervention Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on successful discontinuation rate compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on relapse (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on withdrawal symptoms nor adverse events were provided. None of the studies used low-intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long-term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression. There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as successful discontinuation rate and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks.

### Discontinuation of antidepressants after remission with antidepressant medication in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c76cabae]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, relapse rates can be reduced to 20% through the continuation of the same antidepressant medication used to achieve remission, compared with 40% with antidepressant discontinuation. SSRIs are well-balanced agents, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective for relapse prevention. The relapse rate remained unchanged from 6 months to over 1 year in both the antidepressant and placebo groups. Neither group had an increase in relapse rate after 6 months, so more attention may be needed on the relapse rate in the first 6 months rather than 6 months after remission. All-cause dropout rates can also be reduced by 15% with continued use of antidepressants. This is unlikely to be affected by withdrawal symptoms of antidepressants. The tolerability is equally low with or without antidepressants and prolonged use of antidepressants does not seem to be related to withdrawal of treatment for side effects. Increased rates for relapse and/or dropout in adolescents and older subjects after discontinuing antidepressants may indicate that more attention should be given to these age groups. Maintenance therapy for at least 6 months after remission is recommended to prevent relapse, and attention should be given to relapses and treatment failure during this 6-month period.

How to discontinue

Discontinuation strategies

For antipsychotic discontinuation, no evidence exists that gradual tapering decreases the risk of DS, although some recommend gradual and slowly (in months, possibly hyperbolic) tapering over quicker or abrupt discontinuation (Supplementary Text). Tapered discontinuation (compared to abrupt discontinuation) may reduce the risk of adverse somatic events after full discontinuation, although the minimum dose threshold appears to have more relevance.

Dose reduction

To our knowledge, no published trials have compared dose reduction with complete discontinuation. A meta-analysis found that dose reduction doubles relapse risk relative to dose maintenance, particularly below 200 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalent or 2.5 mg risperidone equivalent, highlighting the importance of the extent of dose reduction. The one trial at the time of writing that had compared antipsychotic dose reduction with maintenance strategies was conducted in people with recurrent psychotic disorders and FEP. It compared maintenance treatment with gradual, monitored, reduction of antipsychotics over several months (median dose reduction at any point 67% in the reduction group and 0% in the maintenance group). The results indicate that social functioning after 2 years is equal between groups, but that the risk of severe relapse is higher in the dose reduction than the maintenance group. In contrast, observational data hint at possible functional improvements in functioning after antipsychotic dose reduction in similar patient populations, but the possibility of confounding by indication precludes definitive conclusions from such data. New trials are underway to compare dose reduction or drug discontinuation with continuation strategies, including guided dose reduction to establish the minimum effective dose. Besides dose reduction studies, intermittent dosing strategies have also been proposed, with either regular gaps in dosing (from alternate days to several weeks), or only initiating antipsychotics when psychotic symptoms emerge, with no antipsychotic use between psychotic episodes. While the first strategy has shown some merits if drug-free days are few, the second strategy increased relapse risk and rehospitalization, limiting the current role of intermittent dosing strategies for antipsychotics.

Discontinuation interventions

No interventions to mitigate relapse risks in those discontinuing antipsychotics have been described. In clinical practice, patients tapering antipsychotics are closely monitored, family members may be involved, and psychosocial interventions may be considered.

### Escitalopram [^439fb47d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^a6eea246]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found data on 594 participants who stopped and then restarted an individual antidepressant with a gap in treatment of between 5 days and greater than 2 years. Of 10 studies reporting failure rates on re-exposure to an antidepressant (n = 362), non-response occurred in 4%–57% of participants. In studies not reporting response rates, there was evidence of reduced magnitude of response on restarting. Given these observations, there is some certainty that breaks in treatment can lead to loss of antidepressant response. However, there is much less certainty about the factors that influence future non-responsiveness and the degree to which response is lost.

Interpretation of reported outcomes is made difficult by several considerations. Most of these studies included either no tapering period or a very rapid tapering of antidepressant treatment, whereas some had prolonged tapering periods. Risk of non-response did not seem to be associated with the tapering method. In fact, the only study in which participants showed no loss of responsiveness was one in which antidepressants were deliberately withdrawn abruptly. However, in this study, participants did not relapse, as such, but merely showed inflated depression rating scale scores because of the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the effect of reinstatement was to cause withdrawal symptoms to abate rather than to re-exert an antidepressant effect. For many studies, it is much less clear whether antidepressants were reinstated because of relapse of the disorder for which they initially received treatment or because antidepressant withdrawal symptoms mimicked relapse. The study with the longest withdrawal period had the highest non-response rate (57%), perhaps reflecting the absence of reinstatement effects on withdrawal symptoms. It is also possible that reinstatement initially mitigates withdrawal symptoms but does not provide longer-term antidepressant or other activity – this seems to have been demonstrated bywho observed a reduced maintenance of response in patients who had previously discontinued fluoxetine abruptly.

### Medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal: a mixed-methods public health review and national database study in england [^6e4ae634]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

With regard to stopping long-term antidepressants, we found patient reports of a range of severe withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, agitation, low mood, and somatic and other symptoms. These symptoms had sudden onset and were protracted and disabling. Although antidepressants are not associated with dependence, anxiety about withdrawal symptoms could dissuade some patients from stopping.

Notably, patients frequently felt that their experiences of withdrawal symptoms were either discounted by clinicians or attributed only as an indication of relapse to depression. The qualitative evidence gathered in this study suggested some positive views of support services, but also a call for better information and discussion of treatment options, better monitoring of progress during treatment, and more community support. Determining optimal tapering procedures to minimise withdrawal symptoms for patients who wish to discontinue antidepressants is a current topic of debate among clinicians.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^906cc6c5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Tapering Antipsychotics

Standard guidelines do not mention antipsychotic deprescribing, or tapering, although some current guidelines encourage reduction to minimum effective doses without specifying how to do so. The principal means to mitigate withdrawal symptoms is to reduce the rate at which the equilibrium is disturbed, so allowing time for the reversal of underlying neuroadaptations to return to baseline. Gradual tapering of antipsychotics, when cessation is the goal, is sometimes advised on this principle. Tapering may reduce the likelihood and intensity of withdrawal symptoms, including, potentially, the risk of withdrawal psychosis.

The persistence of TD, the most visible manifestation of dopaminergic hypersensitivity, for a considerable time following cessation of antipsychotics, provides evidence that neuro-adaptations to antipsychotics persist for many years and supports the need for long tapering. An early review of studies found that it took 2–5 years for 60%–90% of symptoms of TD to resolve following antipsychotic cessation (supplementary table S1). Another study found that 92.8% of patients achieved a 50% reduction in TD symptoms 46 weeks after discontinuing on average 10 years of antipsychotic treatment. A more recent study examined patients with 1 year of TD in whom dopamine antagonists (including metoclopramide) were ceased after 5 years of exposure: in 13% of the patients, symptoms resolved completely (taking 2–4 years, average 2.3), and the number defined as moderate or severe decreased from 63% to less than 20%. This suggests that TD (along with, presumably, dopaminergic hypersensitivity) can resolve when antipsychotics are discontinued but this process might, in some cases, take years, and may be irreversible in some patients.

Tapering periods probably need to be similarly prolonged to minimize the risk of psychotic relapse in people who have been on these medications long term. This is consistent with the finding that relapse rates for discontinued patients tend to match those of maintained patients but only after 1–3 years. Prolonged tapering is not unreasonable given the duration of antipsychotic treatment in many patients, the long persistence of adaptations to antipsychotics in animals to antipsychotics, and the evidence that withdrawal from other medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be prolonged, lasting for months or years, with months-long tapering most effective in minimizing withdrawal symptoms in some people.

### Management of premenstrual disorders: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 7 [^2529d4cc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Premenstrual disorders — SSRI duration and discontinuation: The rate of relapse is high among individuals who discontinue SSRI treatment for premenstrual disorders, and most patients with premenstrual disorders likely will need treatment until menopause. Individuals on continuous treatment regimens will require medication taper if they decide to stop treatment, and short-acting SSRIs (eg paroxetine, sertraline) are associated with the highest likelihood of discontinuation symptoms.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^381244a6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation symptoms are common but remain difficult to predict

First, discontinuation symptoms are common, particularly after abrupt or rapid cessation of medication, except in the case of stimulants. These symptoms generally dampen over time and seem less likely when discontinuation occurs gradually. In general, DS risk is higher for psychotropic drugs with shorter elimination half-lives, such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, clozapine, morphine, oxycodone, lorazepam, and temazepam (Table 1). Nevertheless, estimations of DS prevalence across medication groups are heterogeneous (see also Table 1). A challenge is that DS are often not measured at all, and, if measured, their operationalization varies (e.g. concerning questionnaires, cutoff values, and time points). Moreover, in many blinded studies, medication is abruptly stopped. Thus, current estimations of DS not only reflect the situation following abrupt or very quick cessation, but also include the influence of expectations and patients and clinicians' experiences and may thus be subject to nocebo effects. Finally, it can be challenging to disentangle DS from relapse due to symptom overlap. This may result in DS being misdiagnosed as relapse in discontinuation studies.

Do not discontinue medication too quickly

Second, it is clear that abrupt discontinuation is not only associated with DS, but also entails increased relapse risks. Nevertheless, the optimal period during which medication should be discontinued and the rate of dose reduction are unclear. Pragmatically, discontinuation over months is advisable, but evidence for these strategies is lacking. Gradual lowering of the dose is generally recommended for several reasons. First, relapse may be less severe if a patient is on a medium or low dose relative to discontinuation. Second, steady-state may be more readily re-achieved if relapse occurs while a patient is on a lower dose. Third, gradual tapering may be more comfortable for patients because of the decreased likelihood of DS. Gradual tapering is often possible using conventional dose regimens, and many patients can discontinue using these existing doses. Nevertheless, when discontinuation poses a greater challenge, a gradual decrease with low doses may be feasible. Another option that becomes apparent across medication classes is the possibility to switch to long-acting agents, e.g. diazepam, sustained-release buprenorphine and fluoxetine (although of the latter intervention only case reports are known). For some medications, e.g. opioids and antipsychotics, (demographic) variables have been associated with successful tapering, but given the lack of replicated findings these are not ready for translation into clinical practice.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^145eb4ac]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^7b87d46f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key takeaways — tapering approach and setting: Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and care partners using shared decision‑making strategies, and clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms; physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients; although most patients can complete tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when significant risk cannot be safely managed as an outpatient; clinicians should design the taper to minimize harms, with an initial pace generally including dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks; a boxed caution also states BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly and dosage should be tapered gradually over time under clinical supervision.

### Discontinuation of antidepressants after remission with antidepressant medication in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6a9c8208]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest meta-analysis to date focusing on studies that address the frequently asked clinical question " whether to continue the same antidepressant used to achieve remission or to discontinue" in remitted patients with a major depressive disorder. It was found that overall and, in most subgroups, the relapse rate was significantly lower (by about 20%) in the antidepressant group and NNT was around 6. It was also determined that 80% do not relapse when antidepressants are continued, although this decreases to 60% when discontinued; this can be interpreted as a 40% relapse rate. The rate of acceptability was 43% in the antidepressant group and 58% in the placebo group, with a 15% difference, both of which were 20% greater than the relapse rate. The rates of tolerability for the antidepressant continuation and the placebo group were both ~4%.

2.10	Discontinuing Treatment with Effexor XR

A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended when discontinuing therapy with Effexor XR. In clinical studies with Effexor XR, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at one-week intervals. Individualization of tapering may be necessary. In some patients, discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.11	Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI antidepressant and initiation of Effexor XR. In addition, at least 7 days must elapse after stopping Effexor XR before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^d4eec09a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Tapering Versus Discontinuation

If the clinician determines, in the context of the risk/benefit assessment and shared decision-making, continuing the BZD prescription is no longer appropriate, they need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal. The risk of severe withdrawal syndrome following regular use of therapeutic doses of BZD has been recognized since the 1960 s. Factors including use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment contribute to a higher likelihood of physical dependence and risk of severe withdrawal.

If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued. While limited evidence was found comparing tapering strategies, the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation. Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias. Although labeled "gradual", the taper duration was only 7–8 days. There was no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion between groups. However, patients in the tapering group reported significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks, compared to patients who abruptly stopped their BZD use. In discussing these studies, the CGC agreed that benefits of tapering are likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies. See Table 1 in Supplementary Material 5 for the full Evidence to Decision Table comprising these studies.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^d18cce85]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms after SSRIs typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, also with gradual tapering, but the withdrawal symptoms might include late onset and longer persistence of disturbances and may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. There are many similarities between the withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRIs and the withdrawal symptoms associated with antidepressants such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. A recently published review found that a significant proportion of people who experience withdrawal symptoms after treatment with antidepressants do so for more than 2 weeks and that it is not uncommon for people to experience withdrawal for several months. Withdrawal symptoms may be alleviated by reinstating treatment with the antidepressant that triggered the symptoms, and it may for this, and many other reasons, be difficult for some patients to stop taking antidepressants once the treatment has started. Withdrawal symptoms might also explain why some studies have alleged to show that the risk of relapse seems to be reduced if antidepressants are continued instead of not continued. Withdrawal symptoms might be the reason why patients who do not continue antidepressants might do worse compared with patients who continue antidepressants.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^48ed9548]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A further limitation is that, although it provides evidence that changing therapy after failure to remit at an early point (in our study 3 weeks) may be preferable to waiting a longer period (e.g. the oft-recommended 6 to 8 weeks), the design did not specifically address the optimal timing of the decision to switch or combine. One RCT compared switching to duloxetine immediately after non-response to 4weeks of escitalopram against continuing 4 more weeks on escitalopram and then switching if non-responsive: the two arms did not differ in their primary outcome of time to response, while there was significant increase in a secondary outcome of remission in the early switch arm than in the later switch arm. Another recent RCT examined the value of switching escitalopram to venlafaxine if patients have shown minimal improvement after 2 weeks; remission rates were 8% higher in the switched than in the continuation arm, but this difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to a small sample size (n = 192, p = 0.21). Thus, the optimal time to combine or switch remains uncertain.

Strengths of this pragmatic trial primarily relate to design features that enhance the real-world application of the results. We employed a large number of study sites using broad eligibility criteria, and thus enrolled sufficient patients to achieve high power to establish or refute differences between groups. Because Japan does not have a primary care system, patients with new onset depressive episodes usually consult office practice psychiatrists directly. Thus, in many other countries, primary care doctors would see and begin treatment of most participants entered in SUN☺D. In comparison to many multi-centre trials, we were able to enrol a large proportion (2011 of 7895) of potentially eligible patients. Enrolment of patients not yet treated for their current episode is another strength, eliminating a potential source of variability. For step 1 randomisation, we excluded patients who did not tolerate a low dose of sertraline, faithfully addressing the clinical question in which patients and clinicians are interested: In patients who tolerate an initial low dose of sertraline, should clinicians titrate to the maximum dose? For step 2 randomisation, we selected alternative interventions that are recommended in practice guidelines and are widely used.

### Escitalopram (Escitalopram oxalate) [^19e1f799]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Relapse of vasomotor symptoms after discontinuation of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram: results from the menopause strategies: finding lasting answers for symptoms and health research network [^5949777a]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) recur after discontinuation of hormonal therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used increasingly to treat VMS, but whether VMS recur after cessation of SSRI is unknown. We hypothesized that relapse of VMS to baseline levels after SSRI cessation would be common and predicted by menopausal and psychological characteristics.

Methods

Recurrence of VMS (frequency, severity, and bother) was measured with daily diaries for 3 weeks after cessation of escitalopram, which was administered to perimenopausal/postmenopausal women with hot flashes and night sweats in an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Blinding of staff and participants was maintained throughout. Relapse was defined as mean daily VMS frequency, severity, or bother 20% or less lower than pretreatment levels.

Results

Of 76, 57, and 51 women included in the analysis for VMS frequency, severity, and bother, 34.2%, 38.6%, and 37.3%, respectively, had relapse of VMS frequency, severity, and bother. In adjusted models, VMS frequency relapse was predicted by higher levels of pretreatment insomnia symptoms (P = 0.02) and a weaker response to escitalopram (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Among women whose VMS improved with escitalopram, approximately one third relapsed swiftly after discontinuation of the medication. Those with pretreatment insomnia and those with a weaker response to escitalopram may be at greatest risk for VMS relapse after treatment discontinuation. Women should be educated about the likelihood of VMS symptom relapse when they discontinue SSRIs after receiving benefits from short-term treatment.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^59faaf91]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment modality across psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, many patients discontinue their medication at some point. Evidence-based guidance for patients, clinicians, and policymakers on rational discontinuation strategies is vital to enable the best, personalized treatment for any given patient. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of guidelines on discontinuation strategies. In this perspective, we therefore summarize and critically appraise the evidence on discontinuation of six major psychotropic medication classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, opioids, and stimulants. For each medication class, a wide range of topics pertaining to each of the following questions are discussed: (1) Who can discontinue (e.g. what are risk factors for relapse?); (2) When to discontinue (e.g. after 1 year or several years of antidepressant use?); and (3) How to discontinue (e.g. what's the efficacy of dose reduction compared to full cessation and interventions to mitigate relapse risk?). We thus highlight how comparing the evidence across medication classes can identify knowledge gaps, which may pave the way for more integrated research on discontinuation.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c538e993]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^967d06e0]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60–74 years), and old-old (≥ 75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons, escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥ 65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

The first and last authors revisited the current evidence on discontinuation across the six major medication classes used in psychiatry: antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and opioids. Experts from each medication class were invited to contribute for their respective field. All experts have made significant contributions to the literature in their respective field and most experts have multiple year of experience clinically guiding patients in discontinuing their psychotropic medication. Four consensus meetings were held between January 2021 and October 2021. During the consensus meetings, we defined three essential questions on discontinuation that we considered to be the most clinically relevant:
Who can discontinue with an acceptable risk of recurrence or discontinuation problems? (i.e. determinants of risk of DS and relapse and recurrence risk following discontinuation);
When is the best time to discontinue following remission? (i.e. optimal timing of discontinuation); and
How can medication be most effectively discontinued to prevent recurrence or DS? (i.e. dose reduction strategies and discontinuation interventions).

For each psychotropic medication class, one or several expert(s) then conducted a targeted literature search and selected high-quality key research articles in the literature related to their area of expertise. Key search terms were: "antidepressants", "antipsychotics", "mood stabilizers", "benzodiazepines", "stimulants", "opioids", "discontinuation", "tapering", "discontinuation symptoms", "discontinuation syndrome", "withdrawal", and "relapse". After examining the literature on discontinuation, the expert panel identified commonalities between medication classes and reached consensus with regards to recommendations for clinical practice as well as future research avenues. Finally, the first and last authors critically revised and integrated these contributions into the current piece.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^8da69720]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acceptability and tolerability

Of the 42 reviews, 28 (67%) assessed and reported the dose-response effects related to acceptability (early treatment discontinuation — dropouts) and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects). All reviews demonstrated that dropouts and adverse drug effects increased with increasing dose (table 2).

At a class and individual SSRI level, the following adverse drug effects were associated with (but not limited to) dose-response effects: nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. A network meta-analysis identified escitalopram as potentially providing the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability. However, this study considered that escitalopram doses up to 27 mg/day might be more effective, and all SSRIs demonstrated a poor risk-benefit ratio for older adults (age > 70 years old) owing to adverse effects exceeding potential efficacy.

In the six reviews comparing flexible upward dose titration with maintenance dose for individuals not achieving satisfactory symptom resolution or remission, researchers also demonstrated that higher doses were associated with poorer acceptability and tolerability.

Risk of bias

The assessment revealed that the minority (12%, n = 5) of reviews were at low risk of bias (table 2, figure 2 and online supplemental table S3). Four reviews demonstrated a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and a positive dose-response effect for adverse drug effects and dropouts for all SSRIs. One review, however, indicated that citalopram demonstrated efficacy dose-response to 30 mg/day, and sertraline showed curvy-linear effects peaking at about 75 mg/day. Thirteen (31%) reviews were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias, whereas the majority (57%) had a high risk of bias that was mainly associated with a range of methodological issues.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^248f86cb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering process — clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation); clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); and clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^9268abf8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal mental health remission and tapering — once remission is achieved (e.g., ≥ 2 sequential EPDS/PHQ-9 scores < 10, GAD-7 < 5, PC-PTSD < 3), clinicians can consider tapering antidepressants when remission has been maintained for ≥ 6 months for depression and ≥ 12 months for anxiety; taper slowly to minimize relapse and discontinuation syndrome, noting that shorter acting medications (e.g., paroxetine, venlafaxine) have a higher chance of discontinuation syndrome and need to be tapered slowly, and establish a postpartum birth control plan to support informed family planning decisions.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^c969a8e4]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^e2ccd891]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage and duration of antidepressants

Most studies and meta-analyses have found no benefit for antidepressant dose escalation versus staying on the minimum licensed dose, with an increased risk of side effects and discontinuation, even if there is also evidence that higher doses may have superior efficacy and that higher starting doses may be associated with higher response rates. In terms of 'minimum duration', some studies have shown that, while two weeks can be enough to observe an initial response, a stable response/remission is usually detectable after four weeks. However, a complete remission may not be detectable after four weeks. For example, approximately half of remitters on citalopram in level 1 of the STAR*D trial remitted between week 6 and week 14. Of note, this is different for fast-acting medications, such as esketamine, but these drugs are indicated for individuals that already have TRD.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 74%) that the criteria of 'adequate dose and duration' is the minimal effective dosage, that is, the minimal approved dosage, administered for at least four weeks.

Interestingly, in regulatory clinical trials, participants' discontinuation of treatments may be considered as an endpoint equivalent to a failure. However, we recommend (with strong consensus, 96%) that discontinuation of treatment before the completion of the fourth week, without clear evidence of lack of response, should not be considered as a treatment failure for the purpose of establishing TRD/PRD, especially because of the difficulty in distinguishing retrospectively between non-response and intolerance.

Lexapro should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.  No additional benefits seen at 20 mg/day dose.  10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly. initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.  Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro: A gradual. reduction in dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible.  Seizures: Prescribe with care in patients with a history of seizure.  Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Use cautiously in patients with a history of mania. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lexapro should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.
2.

1 Major Depressive Disorder Initial Treatment Adolescents The recommended dose of Lexapro is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of Lexapro demonstrated the. effectiveness of Lexapro. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks. Adults The recommended dose of Lexapro is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of Lexapro demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg. and 20 mg of Lexapro, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained.

linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Lexapro should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b291d2f8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — short-duration use and short-taper option: Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper, and a short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.

### Escitslopram (escitalopram) [^868a2ef2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^301a8cef]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

### Incidence and risk factors of antidepressant withdrawal symptoms: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^ca73d6b9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants are among the most extensively prescribed psychotropic drugs worldwide. Discontinuation induced withdrawal symptoms have been reported for almost all antidepressants. The incidence of antidepressant withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and other characteristics remain unknown. We searched the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from inception to December 31, 2023. Randomized double-blinded trials, longitudinal or cross-sectional studies that reported the incidence and other characteristics of antidepressant withdrawal symptoms were included. The pooled incidence of AWS was calculated by a random effects model. We included 35 studies, of which 2 studies just provided incidence of specific withdrawal symptoms, and 4 studies only described other characteristics. The pooled incidence of AWS from all available studies was 42.9%, from 11 RCTs was 44.4%, in studies in which the treatment duration was mostly 8–12 weeks, which usually appear within 2 weeks, and were generally measured for < 4 weeks. The incidence in selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was the lowest (29.7%), followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (45.6%) and tricyclic antidepressants (59.7%), without significant differences (p = 0.221). Treatment duration showed a dose-response to the incidence of AWS (6-12W: 35.1%, 12-24W: 42.7%, > 24W: 51.4%). The half-life did not show such a simple dose-dependent relationship. The pooled estimate was robust regardless whether withdrawal symptoms were measured in RCTs or observational studies (including face-to-face and online survey studies). Tapering the dose reduced the incidence of AWS compared with abrupt stoppage (34.5% vs 42.5%), without a significant difference (p = 0.484). Risk factors for withdrawal symptoms included being female, younger, experiencing adverse effects early in treatment, taking higher doses or longer duration of medication, abrupt cessation of drugs, and those with a lower clearance of drugs or with serotonin 1A receptor gene variation. The findings suggest the incidence of AWS are common and some clinical characteristics and risk factors which can help clinicians identify who is at greater risk of experiencing AWS. Discontinuation studies on long-term antidepressant users with long follow-up periods are required in the future.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^6a5d96f9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^ebf383b3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering versus abrupt discontinuation — comparative evidence and guidance: "If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued". In limited evidence, "the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation"; "Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias", and although labeled gradual "the taper duration was only 7–8 days". There was "no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion", but the taper group had "significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks". The CCG agreed that benefits of tapering are "likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies".

### Risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation in anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis of relapse prevention trials [^b42b5d0e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Likewise, as studies included in this meta-analysis had a treatment duration up to one year, we have no answer as to whether patients should continue or may safely discontinue their antidepressants after this period. On the one hand, we can hypothesise that with longer durations of treatment, improvement continues and functioning improves, thereby drifting further away from a relapse. On the other hand, in a study with a naturalistic design, relapse rates after discontinuation were high, even after three years of sustained remission on treatment. Given the importance of this for daily clinical care, randomised controlled trials with long treatment durations are needed in patients who responded to antidepressants. These studies should directly compare various durations of treatment. To date, such studies have been done by Rickels and colleagues and by Mavissakalian and Perel. Both studies had small sample sizes, and, additionally, in part of the sample of Mavissakalian and Perel, discontinuation was not blinded. Results were contradictory. Rickels and colleagues found significantly higher relapse rates following discontinuation in patients treated for six months (53.7%) than in those patients treated for 12 months (32.4%). In contrast, Mavissakalian and Perel found similar relapse rates in patients who were treated for six months and in those who were treated for 12–30 months before discontinuation. Until more data become available, no rational advice can be provided to patients to optimise their long term prognosis after this period of one year. We emphasise that the guidelines' advice to continue treatment for a year should not be interpreted as advice to taper drugs after this period. Thus, by suggesting tapering of drugs following sustained remission, current guidelines are too optimistic. Unfortunately, the discussion as to whether discontinuing antidepressants is wise often does not take place between doctors and their patients.

### Discontinuation of antidepressants after remission with antidepressant medication in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c899db1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

A significant clinical issue encountered after a successful acute major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment is the relapse of depressive symptoms. Although continuing maintenance therapy with antidepressants is generally recommended, there is no established protocol on whether or not it is necessary to prescribe the antidepressant used to achieve remission. In this meta-analysis, the risk of relapse and treatment failure when either continuing with the same drug used to achieved remission or switching to a placebo was assessed in several clinically significant subgroups. The pooled odds ratio (OR) (± 95% confidence intervals (CI)) was calculated using a random effects model. Across 40 studies (n = 8890), the relapse rate was significantly lower in the antidepressant group than the placebo group by about 20% (OR = 0.38, CI: 0.33–0.43, p < 0.00001; 20.9% vs 39.7%). The difference in the relapse rate between the antidepressant and placebo groups was greater for tricyclics (25.3%; OR = 0.30, CI: 0.17–0.50, p < 0.00001), SSRIs (21.8%; OR = 0.33, CI: 0.28–0.38, p < 0.00001), and other newer agents (16.0%; OR = 0.44, CI: 0.36–0.54, p < 0.00001) in that order, while the effect size of acceptability was greater for SSRIs than for other antidepressants. A flexible dose schedule (OR = 0.30, CI: 0.23–0.48, p < 0.00001) had a greater effect size than a fixed dose (OR = 0.41, CI: 0.36–0.48, p < 0.00001) in comparison to placebo. Even in studies assigned after continuous treatment for more than 6 months after remission, the continued use of antidepressants had a lower relapse rate than the use of a placebo (OR = 0.40, CI: 0.29–0.55, p < 0.00001; 20.2% vs 37.2%). The difference in relapse rate was similar from a maintenance period of 6 months (OR = 0.41, CI: 0.35–0.48, p < 0.00001; 19.6% vs 37.6%) to over 1 year (OR = 0.35, CI: 0.29–0.41, p < 0.00001; 19.9% vs 39.8%). The all-cause dropout of antidepressant and placebo groups was 43% and 58%, respectively, (OR = 0.47, CI: 0.40–0.55, p < 0.00001). The tolerability rate was ~4% for both groups. The rate of relapse (OR = 0.32, CI: 0.18–0.64, p = 0.0010, 41.0% vs 66.7%) and all-cause dropout among adolescents was higher than in adults. To prevent relapse and treatment failure, maintenance therapy, and careful attention for at least 6 months after remission is recommended. SSRIs are well-balanced agents, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective for relapse prevention.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^7f217254]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Procedures

In step 1, participants in the minimum dosage arm received 50 mg/day of sertraline at week 1 to be continued through week 3, and those in the maximum dosage arm received 50–75 mg/day at week 1 and 100 mg/day at week 2 to be continued through week 3. When these target dosages were not tolerated, lower dosages were accepted.

In step 2, in the continuing sertraline arm, sertraline was administered as 50 or 100 mg/day according to the initial randomisation. In the combination arm, sertraline was continued and mirtazapine was added between 7.5 and 45 mg/day at the discretion of the study psychiatrist. In the mirtazapine switch arm, mirtazapine between 7.5 mg and 45 mg/day was administered; sertraline was tapered and discontinued by week 7.

Co-administration of benzodiazepines, but not of another antidepressant, antipsychotic or mood stabiliser was allowed up to week 9. Neither was any depression-specific psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) allowed. Those who withdrew consent to the study treatments by week 9 but still participated in follow-up evaluations received treatment as negotiated with their physician. Between weeks 9 and 25, there were no restrictions on treatments, and the continuation therapy was at the physician's discretion.

### Trajectories of relapse in randomised, placebo-controlled trials of treatment discontinuation in major depressive disorder: an individual patient-level data meta-analysis [^80e9735c]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The similarity of trajectories on active medication and on placebo suggests that there is no specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation. The current study supports the continued prescription of SRI antidepressants to protect against relapse of depression. However, it suggests that this protective effect is less than one might have expected. Patients and providers should be prepared for the possibility that as many as one of three patients who initially respond to an antidepressant will worsen over the subsequent six months, which justifies a more widespread effort at preventing relapse in patients with unipolar major depression.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c983f6c4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with SUD — abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous; the CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response; if more rapid tapering is indicated due to imminent safety risks or unsuccessful alternate treatments, clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents; and clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the timing of BZD tapering.
