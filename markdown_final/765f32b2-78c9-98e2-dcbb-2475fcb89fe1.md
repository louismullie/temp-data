## Question

When to give an adult patient with asthma 20mg prednisone instead of 60mg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give an adult with asthma 20 mg prednisone instead of 60 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult dosing for acute asthma exacerbations. Then, I should verify whether 20 mg is ever guideline-supported in adults. Next, I will consider scenarios where a lower dose might be reasonable, including patient-specific factors and stewardship goals. After that, I should review the evidence base for dose-response and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with clear guardrails and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the standard adult regimen. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on prednisone or prednisolone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days for adult acute asthma exacerbations, with no taper required if the course is under 2 weeks, and with prompt initiation to reduce relapse risk [^182ae626] [^24680d4f] [^3e127e12] [^aa4dba04].

> Wait, let me verify whether 20 mg is ever recommended for adults. I need to check the FDA and GINA documents carefully. The FDA labeling lists 40–50 mg daily for adults with acute exacerbations, and pediatric maxima of 20–40 mg/day by age band, but there is no adult indication for 20 mg/day in acute asthma, so 20 mg is below the evidence-based adult range and not guideline-endorsed for exacerbations [^3e127e12] [^aa4dba04] [^4d44e4b9] [^e3169af1]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days has comparable relapse to 3–5 days of prednisolone, but again, this is not equivalent to 20 mg prednisone in adults, and dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days without reassessment [^c33b650b] [^08ed64ba].

> I will now examine whether 20 mg has any evidentiary support in adults. The Cochrane review comparing different oral steroid regimens found no convincing advantage of higher versus lower doses or longer versus shorter courses, but the adult "lower-dose" arms still generally used 40–50 mg prednisolone or equivalent, not 20 mg, so the evidence base does not validate 20 mg for adult exacerbations [^39a46c13] [^39a46c13]. Let me reconsider: some inpatient studies of systemic steroids used broad dose categories, yet even the "low-dose" groups were around 80 mg/day methylprednisolone or less, again not 20 mg, reinforcing that 20 mg is outside the studied adult range for acute asthma [^093b6a2e].

> But wait, what if the clinician is aiming for steroid-sparing in a patient with repeated exposures? I should double-check the cumulative risk data. Cumulative systemic steroid exposure as low as 500–1000 mg prednisone equivalent per year is associated with meaningful adverse effects, so minimizing burst dose and frequency is important; however, this argues for using the lowest effective dose within the evidence-based range and preventing relapses, not for dropping below the effective adult dose of 40–50 mg [^80c3d544] [^4d409c54]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: underdosing could increase relapse and indirectly increase cumulative exposure, so I need to ensure we do not trade short-term dose reduction for long-term harm [^5aac584b].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that might tempt a lower dose. In frail older adults, those with diabetes, osteoporosis, psychosis, or infection risk, I can see why one might consider 20 mg, but I need to ensure this does not compromise efficacy. Given the lack of supportive evidence for 20 mg in adults, a better approach is to use the standard 40–50 mg for 5–7 days with close monitoring, consider shorter courses when appropriate, and mitigate adverse effects proactively rather than underdose the anti-inflammatory therapy [^5aac584b] [^24680d4f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 20 mg might be acceptable in very mild exacerbations, but I should correct that: guidelines do not endorse 20 mg for adults even in milder presentations, so I should not recommend it outside a trial or exceptional circumstance [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12].

> I should confirm the practical guardrails. If a clinician nevertheless contemplates 20 mg, it should be framed as off-label, reserved for exceptional cases after shared decision-making, with explicit follow-up within 24–48 hours to ensure clinical trajectory is not worsening, and with a low threshold to escalate to 40–50 mg if symptoms, PEF, or FEV1 fail to improve as expected. I need to ensure the patient has a written action plan and understands red flags for deterioration [^5aac584b] [^c5eabd05]. Hold on, I should verify that even in primary care pathways, the recommended adult dose remains 40–50 mg, which it does, reinforcing that 20 mg is not standard even outside the hospital setting [^f06caa2b].

> Let me synthesize. There is no guideline-supported scenario in which 20 mg prednisone is the recommended adult dose for an acute asthma exacerbation. The evidence-based standard is 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days without taper if under 2 weeks, with prompt initiation to reduce relapse risk [^5aac584b] [^182ae626] [^24680d4f]. A 20 mg dose may only be considered off-label in rare, carefully selected cases with explicit monitoring and readiness to escalate, acknowledging that this is unsupported by adult data and may increase failure risk [^39a46c13].

In adults with asthma, **20 mg prednisone is not standard** for acute exacerbations; the evidence-based dose is 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12]. A 20 mg dose may be considered only in **exceptional cases** — such as severe steroid intolerance, high risk of adverse effects, or very mild exacerbations — and only with close monitoring and specialist input. It is not appropriate for moderate-to-severe exacerbations or when rapid control is needed, as underdosing increases relapse risk [^bc93adda].

---

## Standard adult prednisone dosing for asthma exacerbations

Current guidelines recommend **40–50 mg prednisone daily for 5–7 days** for adult asthma exacerbations [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12]. This regimen balances efficacy and safety, with no taper needed if the course is under 2 weeks [^1eb4db76] [^be79d939].

---

## Clinical scenarios where 20 mg prednisone may be considered

While 20 mg is below standard, it may be considered in **select scenarios**:

- **Severe steroid intolerance**: Patients with significant adverse effects (e.g. psychosis, severe hyperglycemia, or osteoporosis) may receive a lower dose with close monitoring.

- **High risk of adverse effects**: Elderly patients or those with multiple comorbidities may be started at 20 mg with careful follow-up.

- **Very mild exacerbations**: Minimal symptoms with near-normal lung function may justify a cautious trial of 20 mg, with prompt escalation if no improvement.

---

## Risks and benefits of lower-dose prednisone

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced adverse effects** — such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and immunosuppression — and a lower cumulative steroid exposure, which may mitigate long-term risks (e.g. osteoporosis, adrenal suppression) [^80c3d544].

---

### Potential risks

Potential risks include **insufficient anti-inflammatory control**, which may prolong symptoms, increase relapse, and raise the likelihood of hospitalization [^bc93adda]. Delayed recovery may also impair quality of life and increase healthcare use.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting lower-dose prednisone

Evidence supporting 20 mg prednisone in adults is **limited**. A Cochrane review found no clear advantage of higher over lower doses, but most trials still used 40–50 mg; lower doses were not specifically studied for 20 mg in adults [^bc93adda]. Thus, 20 mg remains off-label and should be used cautiously.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If 20 mg is used, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Re-evaluate within 24–48 hours for symptom progression or lack of improvement.

- **Lung function**: Check peak flow or spirometry to ensure adequate response.

- **Escalation plan**: Increase to 40–50 mg if no meaningful improvement within 48–72 hours.

---

## Alternative therapies and adjuncts

To minimize steroid exposure, consider **adjuncts**:

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Optimize maintenance ICS or use high-dose ICS early in exacerbations to reduce oral steroid needs [^c0664696] [^4a6e4ae9].

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists**: Add montelukast in appropriate patients.

- **Biologics**: For severe, steroid-dependent asthma, consider biologics to reduce or eliminate oral steroid use [^e0f291ea].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended prednisone dose** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard adult exacerbation | 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days | Evidence-based standard of care [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12] |
| Severe steroid intolerance | 20 mg daily with close monitoring | Risk-benefit consideration |
| Very mild exacerbation | 20 mg daily with early reassessment | Cautious, off-label approach |
| Moderate-to-severe exacerbation | 40–50 mg daily | Rapid control and relapse prevention [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12] |

---

20 mg prednisone is **not standard for adult asthma exacerbations** and should be reserved for select cases with careful monitoring. The standard 40–50 mg regimen remains the evidence-based approach for most adults [^5aac584b] [^3e127e12].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^24680d4f]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^08ed64ba]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^315438a9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Optimal asthma control: time for a new target [^6317cf58]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The stepwise approach to pharmacological treatment in adult asthma mandates that asthma treatment is progressively stepped up to achieve symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations and stepped down after a period of prolonged control. This review proposes that in adults without good asthma control, well-controlled asthma can only be achieved in approximately 70% of patients across the strata of severity, and only if there is a progressive increase in inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β 2 agonist therapy to a maintenance inhaled corticosteroid dose that causes the same magnitude of systemic side effects as oral prednisone at a 5-mg daily dose. Another consideration is that in a person with asthma, there are numerous overlapping disorders that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from asthma, comorbidities that contribute to poor control and lifestyle/environmental factors that require treatment in their own right and that if specifically managed might lead to better outcomes. The disparity between patients' perceptions and guideline assessment of control may be due to partially controlled asthma being associated with near-maximal levels of quality of life, with minimal impairment. Finally, it is widely assumed that asthma symptom control equates to elimination of risk of asthma attacks, an assumption that may not apply to many patients, particularly those with more severe asthma. We propose that further research be undertaken to determine the optimal levels of asthma control and the potential value of different treatment targets, such as control of type-2 airway inflammation, that can be achieved with currently available treatment, based on efficacy, side effects, and cost.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended.

STEP 2 Preferred step 2 controller options in adults and adolescents include a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed or low-dose ICS/formoterol as needed. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but can be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an ICS or who have concomitant allergic rhinitis. The preferred step 2 controller for children six to 11 years of age is a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed. Less effective options include a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist or using a low-dose ICS as needed with a SABA. STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed.

STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^9c664514]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^de54c155]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

Outcome and follow-up

Following initial steroid therapy at 0.5 mg/kg/day, our patient continued to improve, and the steroid dose was tailed down over the course of a year. However, she did have occasional relapses with worsened exertional dyspnoea and required uptitration of steroid doses each time.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f06e4a52]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^bc93adda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to oral corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer add-on low-dose oral corticosteroids - ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent - as a last resort in selected adult patients with severe asthma with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with step 5 treatment and after exclusion of other contributory factors and other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable,
recognizing that maintenance oral corticosteroids are often associated with substantial cumulative side effects.

### Two days of dexamethasone versus 5 days of prednisone in the treatment of acute asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^e664bb31]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Dexamethasone has a longer half-life than prednisone and is well tolerated orally. We compare the time needed to return to normal activity and the frequency of relapse after acute exacerbation in adults receiving either 5 days of prednisone or 2 days of dexamethasone.

Methods

We randomized adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 45 years) with acute exacerbations of asthma (peak expiratory flow rate less than 80% of ideal) to receive either 50 mg of daily oral prednisone for 5 days or 16 mg of daily oral dexamethasone for 2 days. Outcomes were assessed by telephone follow-up.

Results

Ninety-six prednisone and 104 dexamethasone subjects completed the study regimen and follow-up. More patients in the dexamethasone group reported a return to normal activities within 3 days compared with the prednisone group (90% versus 80%; difference 10%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 20%; P = 0.049). Relapse was similar between groups (13% versus 11%; difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -7% to 11%, P = 0.67).

Conclusion

In acute exacerbations of asthma in adults, 2 days of oral dexamethasone is at least as effective as 5 days of oral prednisone in returning patients to their normal level of activity and preventing relapse.

### Stepping down the dose of inhaled corticosteroids for adults with asthma [^7f34a5af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a condition of the airways affecting more than 300 million adults and children worldwide. National and international guidelines recommend titrating up the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to gain symptom control at the lowest possible dose because long-term use of higher doses of ICS carries a risk of systemic adverse events. For patients whose asthma symptoms are controlled on moderate or higher doses of ICS, it may be possible to reduce the dose of ICS without compromising symptom control.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence for stepping down ICS treatment in adults with well-controlled asthma who are already receiving a moderate or high dose of ICS.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group and conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception with no restriction on language. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We performed the most recent search in July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration and excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) whose asthma had been well controlled for a minimum of three months on at least a moderate dose of ICS. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with any other respiratory comorbidity. We included trials comparing a reduction in the dose of ICS versus no change in the dose of ICS in people with well-controlled asthma who a) were not taking a concomitant long-acting beta agonist (LABA; comparison 1), and b) were taking a concomitant LABA (comparison 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) using study participants as the unit of analysis and analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included six studies, which randomised a total of 1654 participants (ICS dose reduction, no concomitant LABA (comparison 1): n = 892 participants, three RCTs; ICS dose reduction, concomitant LABA (comparison 2): n = 762 participants, three RCTs). All included studies were RCTs with a parallel design that compared a fixed dose of ICS versus a 50% to 60% reduction in the dose of ICS in adult participants with well-controlled asthma. The duration of the treatment period ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (mean duration 21 weeks; median duration 14 weeks). Two studies were performed in the setting of primary care, two were performed in the secondary care setting and two reported no information on setting. Meta-analysis was hampered by the small number of studies contributing to each comparison, combined with heterogeneity among outcomes reported in the included studies. We found the quality of synthesised evidence to be low or very low for most outcomes considered because of a risk of bias (principally, selective reporting), imprecision and indirectness. Although we found no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between groups with respect to any of the primary or secondary outcomes considered in this review, the data were insufficient to rule out benefit or harm.

Authors' Conclusions

The strength of the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether stepping down the dose of ICS is of net benefit (in terms of fewer adverse effects) or harm (in terms of reduced effectiveness of treatment) for adult patients with well-controlled asthma. A small number of relevant studies and varied outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Additional well-designed RCTs of longer duration are needed to inform clinical practice regarding use of a 'stepping down ICS' strategy for patients with well-controlled asthma.

The dosage of prednisone DR PO for treatment of asthma in adults is 5–60 mg PO daily

### A randomized controlled noninferiority trial of single dose of Oral dexamethasone versus 5 days of oral prednisone in acute Adult asthma [^c80b3083]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Oral dexamethasone demonstrates bioavailability similar to that of oral prednisone but has a longer half-life. We evaluate whether a single dose of oral dexamethasone plus 4 days of placebo is not inferior to 5 days of oral prednisone in treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations to prevent relapse defined as an unscheduled return visit for additional treatment for persistent or worsening asthma within 14 days.

Methods

Adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 55 years) were randomized to receive either a single dose of 12 mg of oral dexamethasone with 4 days of placebo or a 5-day course of oral prednisone 60 mg a day. Outcomes including relapse were assessed by a follow-up telephone interview at 2 weeks.

Results

One hundred seventy-three dexamethasone and 203 prednisone subjects completed the study regimen and telephone follow-up. The dexamethasone group by a small margin surpassed the preset 8% difference between groups for noninferiority in relapse rates within 14 days (12.1% versus 9.8%; difference 2.3%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 8.6%). Subjects in the 2 groups had similar rates of hospitalization for their relapse visit (dexamethasone 3.4% versus prednisone 2.9%; difference 0.5%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 3.1%). Adverse effect rates were generally the same in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

A single dose of oral dexamethasone did not demonstrate noninferiority to prednisone for 5 days by a very small margin for treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Enhanced compliance and convenience may support the use of dexamethasone regardless.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and adult asthma [^1acfe0d6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The best way to show an ICS dose response and compare ICS products is therefore not to use unselected patients but, rather, to choose patients with either high sputum eosinophils or high F NO and then perform dose escalation studies. Furthermore, ICS dose response also depends on the outcome measured, with airway hyperresponsiveness showing the best dose-dependent improvement over time.

As stated in all guidelines, we should always consider using the lowest possible dose of ICS (or oral corticosteroids [OCS], and ideally no OCS) to control asthma while avoiding the risks for adverse effects. Doses of ICS may be minimized by various measures, including environmental control, use of adjunct therapies such as long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, and in the more severe patient, by the early introduction of biologics. However, prevention of OCS use and related exacerbations should be a priority, which could be avoided in some patients by using high doses of ICS. In this regard, in a study over a median period of 10 years (maximum, 30 yr), we showed that when the dose of ICS/prednisone was adjusted to keep sputum eosinophils under control, exacerbations and the rate of decline of lung function were significantly reduced, although at a price of adverse effects, mainly when OCS was needed. Adverse effects of high doses of ICS have been confounded by methodologic issues and intercurrent OCS use, and there is probably also a variation in susceptibility to those effects from one patient to another.

We therefore agree with Beasley and colleagues that we should prevent overdosing with ICS when not necessary, and that in this regard, there is a significant care gap in asthma management with an underutilization of noninvasive measurements of airway inflammation, particularly in moderate to severe asthma. We endorse the need for rigorous dose–response studies of ICS to be conducted in patients who are well characterized on the basis of their inflammatory endotypes.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^c2f14e38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c0664696]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

Self-management of worsening asthma — criteria for adding oral corticosteroids (OCS) specify that if PEF or FEV1 < 60% best, or not improving after 48 hours, continue reliever, continue controller, contact doctor, and add prednisolone* 40–50 mg/day; additionally, add OCS for severe exacerbations (e.g. PEF or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted), or patient not responding to treatment over 48 hours, with adults taking prednisolone* 40–50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days, and tapering is not needed if OCS are prescribed for less than 2 weeks.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries [^5a77eed9]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinical concerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatment is initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved and maintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid administered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustained benefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefits can be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced in patients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not have clinically deleterious side effects on the bones, growth, eye, or hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis. However, they do not normalize lung function and prevent structural changes in the airway wall in all asthmatic patients.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^136590c3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of OCS that is determined to control asthma symptoms without causing AEs. Experts are calling for 'OCS stewardship' to reduce the risks, including AI, related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS‐sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long‐term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal‐induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS (mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists and allergists). Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage (or complete discontinuation) should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long‐term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than 4 repeat courses of short‐term OCS in 1 year.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^34f7b8a8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^e2b98ac9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severity vs. control

Management guidelines for asthma, as with many other diseases, include treatment algorithms based on severity of disease, as defined by the clinical features before treatment or by the treatment given. Severity usually refers to the degree of underlying pathology. Deciding the severity of asthma is not always easy. When respiratory specialists were shown a number of case studies and asked to assign the severity of the asthma for each case, there was considerable disagreement. The inherent variability of asthma also presents problems for classification of severity. Severe asthma, defined as persisting symptoms despite high levels of treatment, is likely to have a number of underlying reasons, including psychological and adherence factors.

Although the factors indicating control may be the same as those indicating severity (e.g. persistent symptoms, impaired lung function, high bronchodilator use, oral steroid use, unscheduled consultations, hospitalisations, life-threatening attacks), there is a difference in the two concepts. Patients with severe asthma can be well-controlled, while those with mild underlying disease can show signs of poorly controlled disease. Changing the management plan to one based on control and the goals of patients may show improved outcomes compared to a plan based on severity.

Hospital-based studies have suggested that outcomes may be better with treatment algorithms based on parameters that are more closely linked to control than usual symptom-based management protocols. There is a reduction in exacerbation rate, although a higher inhaled corticosteroid load received, in patients given treatments that optimise reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity, rather than treatment on the basis of symptoms. Likewise, a treatment strategy based on normalisation of sputum eosinophil levels resulted in reduced exacerbations compared to standard management protocols, without increasing steroid exposure. A randomised controlled trial conducted in New Zealand used a management strategy incorporating exhaled nitric oxide (NO) readings and achieved control that was at least as good as that obtained with a guideline-based approach but using a lower inhaled steroid dosage. The GOAL study used a strategy based on the combined aims of treatment given in the GINA guidelines, and showed that the majority of patients treated with individually titrated doses of inhaled corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with long-acting beta 2 -agonist, could achieve and maintain control.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^4d409c54]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

### Inhaled corticosteroids and adult asthma [^28b0277d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the concise review by Beasley and colleagues on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in adult asthma. We agree that the definition of low, moderate, and high doses of ICS is arbitrary, as stated in the Global Initiative for Asthma report, although the Global Initiative for Asthma makes clear that it is simply an assessment of estimated clinical comparability based on available studies and product information, and that a large number of patients with asthma need only a low dose of ICS.

However, with regard to the statement that the maximum obtainable patient benefit is with low-dose ICS, we would like to emphasize that the evidence provided to support this statement is from studies on nonphenotyped asthma, a significant proportion of which probably have no or low levels of airway eosinophilia. The main therapeutic target of ICS is the eosinophil, and the degree of airway eosinophilia varies significantly from one patient to another, so that the dose of ICS needed to reduce such eosinophilia significantly varies greatly. It is likely that the "classical" benefit/systemic effects curve differs significantly in eosinophilic asthma, and that the observed plateau is shifted to the right in this population. The reason for the reported lack of efficacy of doubling and quadrupling of doses of ICS is likely that the nature of airway inflammation was not considered in those clinical trials. Furthermore, studies that have looked at sputum eosinophils have demonstrated that high doses of corticosteroids are as effective as prednisone in moderate to severe exacerbations. Another study showed that high-dose ICS is also effective in treating exacerbations of asthma.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^093b6a2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

Objectives

To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (≤ 80 mg), medium dose (> 80 mg and ≤ 360 mg) and high dose (> 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.

Main Results

Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted on 3rd August 2000. No new trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (≤ 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or ≤ 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.

Box 9–4 — primary care treatment and discharge for asthma exacerbations: initial treatment includes "SABA 4–10 puffs by pMDI + spacer, repeat every 20 minutes for 1 hour", "Prednisolone: adults: 40–50 mg, children 1–2 mg/kg, max. 40 mg", and "Controlled oxygen (if available): target saturation 93–95% (children: 94–98%)". Continue treatment with SABA as needed and "ASSESS RESPONSE AT 1 HOUR (or earlier)". Assess for discharge when "Symptoms improved, not needing SABA", "PEF improving, and > 60–80% of personal best or predicted", "Oxygen saturation > 94% room air", and "Resources at home adequate".

### What harm are we doing to our patients with asthma by using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids? [^dd16ade9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids have been a cornerstone of antiinflammatory therapy for more than 6 decades, including for asthma. Despite their effectiveness, serious adverse effects remain a major safety limitation. Concerns over these side effects have been further heightened with the evidence that dose-associated risks are cumulative, with a threshold of 1.5 g, equivalent to approximately four bursts of prednisone.

The development of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) mitigated many of these adverse effect concerns. ICSs provide direct antiinflammatory effects on the asthmatic airway, realizing benefits in microgram rather than milligram doses. Principal worries about adverse events of ICSs are largely from local oropharyngeal deposition: hoarseness, odynophagia, and oral fungal infections. Based on their efficacy and presumed safety, ICSs have become the asthma "controller" treatment of choice for millions of patients. With increasing disease severity, the guidelines recommend escalation of ICS doses (typically in a stepwise fashion) to achieve symptom control. For example, a high-dose ICS (≥ 1,000 μg/d of beclomethasone or equivalent), usually in combination with another controller drug, is recommended for patients with Global Initiative for Asthma step 5 disease severity, although in reality, many patients with even lesser disease severity are treated with high-dose ICSs. In other therapeutic areas, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ICSs, especially in high doses, have been associated with increased risk of serious adverse effects, such as pneumonia. However, the safety data of ICSs in asthma have been inconsistent.

### Prospective, placebo-controlled trial of 5 vs 10 days of oral prednisolone in acute adult asthma [^611b49a4]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral steroid treatment in the management of acute adult asthma is unclear. We prospectively studied the effect of 5 vs. 10 days of oral prednisolone in patients with acute asthma requiring hospital admission.

Methods

Each patient received 40 mg of enteric-coated prednisolone daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of 40 mg prednisolone daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 20). All were given their usual inhaled asthma therapy including inhaled corticosteroids. Patients kept PEF and symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

For the 5-day treatment group mean (95% CI) early morning PEF was 6 (-47,+36) l/min lower to day 21 (P = 0.78). There was no evidence of differences in other PEF measures (morning post-bronchodilator, evening or worst of day). One patient in each group had an exacerbation requiring further oral steroids during the 21-day observation period. Asthma symptom scores were worse in the 5-day group on days 6–21 but the significance of this finding was uncertain, as a difference had emerged by day 5 (prior to trial entry).

Conclusions

It may be possible to reduce the standard steroid course to 5 days in acute adult asthma, provided all patients receive inhaled steroids and a personal asthma management plan.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^e0f291ea]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future direction

Despite the advent of targeted biologics and OCS drawbacks and disadvantages, corticosteroids continue to be used in asthma management. The goal is to find ways to greatly reduce or eliminate their long‐term use and to better balance the safety and effectiveness of asthma treatments.

There are gaps in knowledge and practice related to OCS stewardship. Systemic corticosteroids are the option of last resort in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 treatment, and GINA recommends gradual decrease and/or discontinuation of OCS after patients achieve a good response to biologic therapies. Ideally, the role of OCS will continue to narrow as the use of novel therapies targeting specific pathways increases.

In order to prevent both the systemic effects and the development of AI associated with long‐term OCS use, steroid‐sparing strategies are needed to advance safety amongst patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Treatments that directly target airway inflammation offer improved overall control of asthma and reduce OCS use. Biologic therapies greatly decrease the role of OCS and, in many cases, eliminate their need entirely.

Education is key to elevating awareness of optimal asthma control for patients, as well as steroid‐sparing strategies amongst clinicians. Ongoing clinical trials are already changing clinical practice by guiding the tapering of OCS and the screening and management of AI after introducing biologics. Importantly, substantial and long‐lasting modifications in prescribing patterns of OCS may well require changes to healthcare systems and collaborations amongst different specialties.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^3719d046]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are an important therapy for severe asthma and COPD exacerbations, and their use is recommended for patients who do not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy (Table 2). Interestingly, although corticosteroids are recommended for both diseases, their benefit in COPD exacerbations seems to be driven by a subpopulation with high T2 inflammation and elevated eosinophil counts, drawing interest in using eosinophil levels to guide steroid administration among patients who are not critically ill.–

Strong evidence supports corticosteroids for asthma and COPD exacerbations treated in the acute care setting. – Few studies have evaluated corticosteroids in adult patients who are critically ill with asthma exacerbations, particularly those necessitating mechanical ventilation. For COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (either noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), one study found that corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in duration of IMV and rate of NIV failure, whereas another study found no difference in outcomes.

Among patients managed in acute care settings, the recommended regimen is prednisone 1 mg/kg/d up to 50 mg/d or equivalent for 5 to 7 days for asthma and prednisone 40 mg/d for 5 days for COPD based on studies showing shorter courses (5–7 days vs 10–14 days) resulted in similar rates of treatment failure and relapse with reduced risk of pneumonia and death.– Of the few studies conducted in patients who are critically ill, most used higher doses. However, very high doses (ie, methylprednisolone > 240 mg/d) have been associated with increased treatment failure, duration of IMV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events, including hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy and fungal infections. Currently evidence to suggest routine use of higher corticosteroid doses is limited, and we recommend prednisone 40 to 50 mg/d for at least 5 days with consideration of higher doses in patients with life-threatening disease or those not responding to initial therapy.

All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Initial starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids in adults with asthma: a systematic review [^65e42182]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma guidelines vary in their recommendations for the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in asthma. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS for asthma in adults.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials comparing two doses of the same ICS in adults with asthma and no concomitant inhaled or oral corticosteroid were assessed. Included trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: high (≥ 800 microg/day beclomethasone (BDP)) versus moderate (400 < 800 microg/day BDP) (n = 7); moderate versus low (< 400 microg/day BDP) (n = 6); step down versus constant dose (n = 4).

Results

Fourteen publications describing 13 trials were included in the review. Studies (n = 4) that compared a step down approach with a constant moderate/low dose of ICS found no difference in lung function, symptoms, or rescue medications between the two treatment approaches (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in morning peak flow after treatment with high compared with moderate dose ICS. When compared with low dose ICS, moderate dose ICS significantly improved morning peak flow (change from baseline WMD 11.14 l/min, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06).

Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, starting with a moderate dose is equivalent to starting with a high dose and stepping down. The small non-significant benefits of starting with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use. Initial moderate ICS doses appear to be more effective than an initial low ICS dose.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### The dose-response characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids when used to treat asthma: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^11b24e50]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids form the cornerstone of treatment for most patients with asthma. A range of compounds are available with a wide range of prescribable doses. In this overview, we summarize the findings from a number of Cochrane systematic reviews that have examined the relative benefits of different doses of beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide and fluticasone propionate when used to treat children and adults. The key findings are that all inhaled corticosteroids demonstrate a dose-response relationship for efficacy measures, but most of the benefit in mild-to-moderate severity disease is gained in the low-to-moderate dose range of each drug. In this group, high doses of fluticasone lead to small improvements in measures of control at the expense of a steep increase in the incidence of oral side-effects. In patients with severe disease who are dependent on oral steroids, there may be appreciable benefit in reducing oral steroids from very high compared with high doses of fluticasone.

18 It typically resolves with temporary cessation of the medication, but may also resolve with a change from a dry-powder inhaler to a metered dose inhaler with spacer. Because of their delayed onset of action, inhaled steroids are insufficient for moderate to severe exacerbations. 7 Instead, oral steroid treatment is recommended: 1 to 2 mg per kg per day for three to 10 days in children, or 40 to 60 mg per day in one or two divided doses for five to 10 days in adults. Tapering is not necessary.
19. Montelukast is taken once daily, whereas zafirlukast is used twice daily. For patients 12 years and older, combining leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids is an alternative for moderate persistent asthma, but studies of this combination have been limited. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are indicated in exercise-induced bronchospasm and can improve the condition in up to 50 percent of patients. They are the treatment of choice for aspirin-sensitive asthma.

Usual dosages range from 150 to 375 mg administered subcutaneously every two to four weeks, depending on IgE level and patient weight. The approximate retail price is $738 for a 150-mg vial. 32, 33 Because of the required monitoring and side effects involved in its use, omalizumab therapy should probably be instituted only in collaboration or consultation with an asthma subspecialist. 2 agonists only as needed for relief of symptoms or before anticipated exposure to known asthmatic triggers. Puffs can be taken in 10- to 15-second intervals; longer intervals offer no benefits. 40 Increasing the use of shortacting beta 2 agonists or using them more than two days per week for symptom relief generally indicates inadequate control of asthma and the need to initiate or intensify anti-inflammatory therapy.

A high-dose strategy can be used initially and then reduced as control is achieved. Follow-up should be scheduled within two weeks to assess initial response; if low-dose therapy does not provide adequate control, a step up is indicated. High-dose therapy, if effective, should be continued for three months before considering a step down in therapy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^dd0ddc93]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^80c3d544]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Actively Address Asthma Exacerbation Management and Prevention

Best Practice Advice 5: Recognize the cumulative adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use and work to avoid their overuse by preventing future exacerbations

While some asthma exacerbations may require SCS, earlier recognition and use of ICS with SABA or fast-acting LABA for quick relief or early in an exacerbation may mitigate the need for SCS. Rarely, if ever, are SCS required for effective maintenance management, and their use should be minimized where possible due to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects.

Adverse effects resulting from SCS use occur based on cumulative lifetime dose, starting at doses as low as 500 mg of prednisone or equivalent and less than 30 days of exposure. Adverse effects of SCS can occur with both chronic and repeated episodic use with cumulative doses ≥ 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent per year, regardless of the length of treatment. A common regimen for exacerbation management is prednisone (or equivalent) 40–60 mg for 5–10 days, adding up to a cumulative dose of 200–600 mg per exacerbation, approaching or exceeding the long-term effect risk threshold after even a single course of SCS. Higher cumulative SCS doses are associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, kidney impairment, cataracts, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain –.

To limit the use of SCS, PCCs can implement asthma treatment that appropriately uses ICS-based therapies in both acute and maintenance regimens, thereby reducing the risk of exacerbations and the need for SCS. PCCs should include monitoring patients for adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially among those with multiple courses of SCS therapy over the years of their asthma care.

### Medical therapy for asthma: updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^0fb7758a]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists) are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication; studies have demonstrated that when inhaled corticosteroids are used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication. Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient, and such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids. For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred. Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates inadequate control of asthma and the need to initiate or intensify anti-inflammatory therapy. Oral systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat moderate to severe asthma exacerbations.

### Severe asthma guidelines in children and adolescents: a practical document for physicians [^d821f038]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common disease in childhood with a minority of affected children suffering from severe asthma. Patients with severe asthma require high dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroids to be well-controlled or remain uncontrolled despite such treatment. Although only a small subset of children and adolescents falls in this category, the management of affected patients represents a major concern for pediatricians. Guidelines and recommendations have been designed to guide the management of this group of patients. Though the terms "recommendations" and "guidelines" are often used interchangeably, it should be noted that the first one should be used more narrowly to identify specific actions and the second one to broadly refer to the umbrella under which multiple recommendations for a specific condition are provided. Moreover, the availability of several and sometimes-conflicting documents on severe asthma management both in adult and pediatric age could generate confusion among health care professionals. The manuscript analyses seven papers addressing severe asthma, comparing any key aspects and differences. Finally, we tried to create a more practical document for physicians to simplify the interpretation of the several available documents on severe asthma management focusing the pediatric age.

### Anti-leukotriene agents compared to inhaled corticosteroids in the management of recurrent and / or chronic asthma in adults and children [^8847a09d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-leukotrienes agents are currently being studied as alternative first line agents to inhaled corticosteroids in mild to moderate chronic asthma.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotriene agents with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and to determine the dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes to daily dose of ICS.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Aug 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Aug 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Aug 2003), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2003), abstract books, and reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids during a minimal 30-day intervention period in asthmatic patients aged 2 years and older.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality or trials and extracted trial data. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included lung function, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects and withdrawal rates.

Main Results

27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration varied from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Twenty six (95% CI: 17 to 47) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra exacerbation. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes where()the improvement in FEV(1) reached 130 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Twenty nine (95% CI 20 to 48) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not different between groups.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Inhaled steroids at a dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent are more effective than anti-leukotriene agents given in the usual licensed doses. The exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotriene agents in mcg of ICS remains to be determined. Inhaled glucocorticoids should remain the first line monotherapy for persistent asthma.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^64c096f0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Suehs and colleagues (pp.) provide an expert consensus report on the important topic of OCS use and tapering in patients with asthma, including statements on less frequent conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A modified Delphi method was used to develop a consensus (> 70% agreement) among 131 experts from different specialties, mostly pulmonologists (73%) and allergists (18%), in addition to patient advocacy organization representatives. Although opinions sometimes differed, some general principles for use and reduction of OCS were agreed on.

This study is a first major attempt to provide clinicians with guidelines based on expert opinion specifically on OCS use for asthma. In the absence of evidenced-based clinical data to support such recommendations, using a Delphi approach to reach consensus statements is a sensible and pragmatic approach. The study included a considerable number of experts, more than expected in a usual Delphi method. However, the criteria used for expert selection were sound and the resulting panel, although large, had the required expertise in severe asthma needed to provide valuable opinions.

The project undertaken by the panel of experts is substantial, with 296 final statements to agree on, from an initial 1,447 raw statements produced from brainstorming. Nevertheless, the participating experts were dedicated, with 96 of the 131 answering the three ranking rounds.

In line with current recommendations, almost all experts on the panel (95%) agreed that our goal should be not to use OCS, but they also acknowledged that maintenance OCS, although a last resort, are still required in some situations. On this matter, the optimal daily OCS dose-reaching consensus was equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone. Up until now, only the Global Initative for Asthma group committed to an "acceptable" OCS dose for maintenance therapy and they settled on the dose corresponding to the physiological steroid production, 7.5 mg daily. However, the lower threshold agreed on by the experts may only reflect the submitted statements as it seems that 7.5 mg was not an option to choose from.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^09adf354]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation against SABA-Only Treatment

Since 2019, GINA has recommended against SABA-only treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents after consideration of its risks and the evidence for a safer alternative. Instead, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations and control symptoms, all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive ICS-containing treatment, either regularly or, in mild asthma, as needed to relieve symptoms. ICS is now also recommended for all children 6–11 years with asthma, either regularly or, in mild asthma, whenever SABA is taken for symptom relief.

Rationale

Although SABA is inexpensive and relieves symptoms quickly, treatment of asthma with SABA alone is associated with increased risk of asthma-related death and of urgent asthma-related health care, even in patients with so-called intermittent asthma. Overuse of SABAs (⩾3 × 200-dose albuterol canisters per year) is associated with incrementally increasing risk of asthma exacerbations and mortality, including in patients treated with SABA alone. Regular use of SABA, even 2–4 times per day for 1–2 weeks, is associated with β 2 -receptor downregulation, loss of bronchodilator response, increased airway hyperresponsiveness, and increased airway inflammation. Importantly, from a cognitive and behavioral perspective, starting treatment with SABA alone trains the patient to regard it as their main asthma treatment, increasing the challenges for adherence with any subsequent advice to take ICS every day even when asymptomatic.

By contrast, in mild asthma, as-needed ICS–formoterol decreases the risk of severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid (OCS) by ⩾60% compared with SABA alone, including in patients without elevated type 2 inflammatory markers, with a very small average daily ICS dose. Starting treatment with as-needed ICS–formoterol in patients with mild asthma addresses both symptom relief and risk reduction without the need for daily maintenance treatment.

Mild asthma — as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol for symptom relief is supported by randomized evidence, with low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed investigated in six randomized controlled trials and showing reduced severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). Compared with regular ICS, severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, and a meta-analysis reported the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower versus regular ICS–plus as-needed SABA. As-needed ICS–formoterol was as effective as daily ICS for reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and reductions in severe exacerbations versus regular ICS (or SABA alone) were independent of baseline characteristics; qualitative research found it was preferred by most patients with mild asthma but emphasized shared decision making is needed.

The Safest corticosteroids are the Fewest corticosteroids

For patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with T2 inflammation, reduction or elimination of long‐term OCS, without loss of control, can be accomplished by using a biologic treatment directed towards inflammatory mediators. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE and decreases the expression of IgE receptors on inflammatory cells; dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL‐4 receptor that blocks both IL‐4 signalling and IL‐13 signalling and ultimately lessens inflammation; mepolizumab and reslizumab are monoclonal antibodies that act as IL‐5 antagonists, effectively neutralizing IL‐5 and selectively inhibiting inflammation in the airways; and benralizumab is an IL‐5Rα‐directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody that directly binds to the IL‐5 receptor and activates antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity, ultimately decreasing eosinophilic inflammation.

Biologics have led to decreased OCS use, reduced rates of exacerbations and improved symptom control, and they are approved as add‐on therapy for patients with severe, persistent asthma. Although the OCS‐sparing results of both clinical trials and real‐world analyses of biologics in asthma are promising, many studies used short evaluation periods and small sample sizes. In addition, cautious approaches were used to taper OCS, given the placebo‐controlled nature of some of these studies, and AI was not consistently monitored (Table 2).

Table 2
Studies of OCS‐sparing capabilities of biologic agents for severe asthma

The PONENTE trial, the results of which are expected in mid‐2021, seeks to address the gaps left by previous studies and answer key questions to guide real‐world clinical practice, including how quickly long‐term OCS can be tapered and how best to monitor for and manage AI after introducing benralizumab. PONENTE is the largest OCS‐sparing trial conducted to date, with a goal of including approximately 600 patients, and is the only one to directly address AI. The PONENTE trial will outline a personalized, rapid tapering of supraphysiologic dosages of OCS based on OCS dosage and asthma control, as well as provide guidance on tapering OCS in the presence of suspected or confirmed AI. The maintenance phase is also substantially longer (24–32 weeks after the OCS reduction phase) than most other studies (4 weeks). This longer maintenance phase will detail the long‐term effectiveness and safety of benralizumab after OCS reduction or elimination.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^57a1e543]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-down and sequencing with biologic therapy and oral corticosteroids (OCS) — once good symptom control has been maintained for 2–3 months, and if the patient has not had any exacerbations, asthma treatment can be carefully down-titrated to the minimum medications and dose that will maintain good symptom control and minimize exacerbation risk, while reducing the potential for side-effects. For patients with severe asthma who have had a good asthma response to biologic therapy, a longer period of stability is recommended before the ICS dose is reduced, and reduction and cessation of OCS should be undertaken first; patients who are being considered for a high daily dose of ICS (except for short periods) should be referred for expert assessment and advice, where possible.

Discussion

This systematic literature review identified a large body of evidence from observational studies documenting real-world clinical practice regarding the use of OCS/SCS therapy for the general asthma population and especially for patients with more severe disease. Identified studies reported that short- and long-term OCS/SCS therapy is widely used to treat patients with asthma, particularly those with severe disease. Overall, OCS use was typically reported in approximately half of patients in the general asthma population over a 1-year period, and short-term use was reported in up to 36% of patients. Guidelines recommend OCS for short-term treatment of serious exacerbations or as add-on maintenance therapy for patients with severe disease that is not controlled by high-dosage maintenance treatment. These recommendations restrict OCS use to an estimated 10% of patients with severe disease and approximately 10% who experience an exacerbation in any given year. Thus, our findings indicate that in many instances, > 10% of patients are receiving OCS treatment, suggesting that OCS may be overused for asthma management.

Long-term OCS use was consistently infrequent across all age groups for patients with nonsevere disease (< 2%). However, up to 60% of patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma were reported to have received long-term OCS therapy. The extent of long-term OCS/SCS use has not been reported in other analyses. Furthermore, identified studies reported that OCS are used as long-term therapy at dosages up to 22 mg/d, which is greater than the prednisone-equivalent dosage (≤ 7.5 mg/d) recommended in GINA guidelines as add-on therapy for patients with asthma that is not controlled by high-dosage therapy (GINA step 4 treatment). These results suggest that patients are repeatedly treated with OCS at increasingly greater dosages, possibly despite their lack of response to OCS therapy or because of the nontargeted action of OCS. This may be because OCS are considered generally effective for all patients with asthma and are frequently prescribed in the absence of defined disease markers and objective response monitoring, such as lung function.

Dosage

SYSTEMIC

The suggested initial dose is 60 mg, injected deeply into the gluteal muscle. Atrophy of subcutaneous fat may occur if the injection is not properly given. Dosage is usually adjusted within the range of 40 mg to 80 mg, depending upon patient response and duration of relief. However, some patients may be well controlled on doses as low as 20 mg or less.

Hay fever or pollen asthma: Patients with hay fever or pollen asthma who are not responding to pollen administration and other conventional therapy may obtain a remission of symptoms lasting throughout the pollen season after a single injection of 40 mg to 100 mg.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of triamcinolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for one month are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Neuro-Psychiatric).

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of triamcinolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

LOCAL

Intra-articular administration: A single local injection of triamcinolone acetonide is frequently sufficient, but several injections may be needed for adequate relief of symptoms.

Initial dose: 2.5 mg to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 mg to 15 mg for larger joints, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. For adults, doses up to 10 mg for smaller areas and up to 40 mg for larger areas have usually been sufficient. Single injections into several joints, up to a total of 80 mg, have been given.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^90940596]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Expert consensus on the tapering of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. A Delphi study [^c2285027]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: There is a need to minimize oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in patients with asthma to prevent their costly and burdensome adverse effects. Current guidelines do not provide recommendations for OCS tapering in patients with asthma. Objectives: To develop expert consensus on OCS tapering among international experts. Methods: A modified Delphi method was used to develop expert consensus statements relating to OCS use, tapering, adverse effects, adrenal insufficiency, and patient-physician shared decision-making. Initial statements proposed by experts were categorized, filtered for repetition, and presented back to experts over three ranking rounds to obtain consensus (≥ 70% agreement). Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-one international experts participated in the study, and 296 statements were ranked. Numerous recommendations and guidance regarding appropriate OCS use were established. Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in all patients with asthma receiving maintenance OCS therapy, with personalization of tapering rhythm and speed. The importance of recognizing individual adverse effects was also established; however, a unified approach to the assessment of adrenal insufficiency was not reached. Shared decision-making was considered an important goal during the tapering process. Conclusions: In this Delphi study, expert consensus statements were generated on OCS use, tapering, adverse-effect screening, and shared decision-making, which may be used to inform clinical practice. Areas of nonconsensus were identified, highlighting uncertainty among the experts around some aspects of OCS use in asthma, such as adrenal insufficiency, which underscores the need for further research in these domains.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d6d123b5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — mild asthma retrospective definition and risk: The page notes variability in criteria, including whether "FEV1 should be ≥ 80% predicted" and whether any exacerbation precludes a 'mild' label "for the next 12 months". By this definition, classification as 'mild' applies only after several months of ICS-containing treatment and only if well controlled on low-dose ICS or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, and studies indicated baseline features (daily reliever use, lower lung function, history of exacerbations, blood eosinophils or FeNO) did not identify patients who should instead receive daily ICS; decisions about ongoing treatment should rely on evidence for as-needed ICS-formoterol or daily ICS plus individualized assessment. The term 'mild asthma' may encourage complacency despite the fact that "up to 30% of asthma exacerbations and deaths occur in people with infrequent symptoms, for example, less than weekly or only on strenuous exercise".

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^6eb90625]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

### High dose versus low dose inhaled corticosteroid as initial starting dose for asthma in adults and children [^e89138af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) form the basis of maintenance therapy in asthma and their efficacy is well established. However, the optimal starting dose of ICS is not clearly established. Recent reviews demonstrate a relatively flat efficacy curve for ICS and increasing side effects with increasing ICS doses. High doses are frequently prescribed and there are now reports of significant side effects occurring with high dose ICS use. These issues demonstrate the need to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS in asthma.

Objectives

To establish the optimal starting dose of ICS by evaluating the efficacy of initial high dose ICS with low dose ICS in subjects with asthma, not currently on ICS.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: January 2003

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of two different doses of the same ICS in adults and children with asthma with no concomitant ICS or OCS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation. Trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: step down vs constant dose ICS (n = 7); high vs moderate (n = 11); high vs low (n = 9); moderate vs low (n = 11); fold change in dose (all studies).

Main Results

31 papers reporting the results of 26 trials were included in the review. For studies that compared a step down approach to a constant moderate/low ICS dose, there were no significant differences in lung function, symptoms, rescue medications or asthma control between the two treatment approaches. Significant but clinically small improvements in percent predicted FEV(1) (WMD 5.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 9.99) and non significant improvements in the change in morning PEF were found for high dose ICS compared to moderate dose ICS. There were no significant differences in efficacy between high and low dose ICS. For moderate dose ICS, compared to low dose ICS, there were significant improvements in the change in morning PEF l/min from baseline (WMD 11.14, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06). Commencing ICS at double or quadruple a base moderate or low dose had no greater effect than commencing with the base dose. Several studies reported greater improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness for high dose ICS.

Reviewers' Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, commencing with a moderate dose ICS is equivalent to commencing with a high dose ICS and down-titrating. The small significant benefits of commencing with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use when compared to moderate or low dose ICS. Initial moderate ICS dose appears to be more effective than initial low ICS dose. High dose ICS may be more effective than moderate or low dose ICS for airway hyperresponsiveness. There is no benefit in doubling or quadrupling ICS in subjects with stable asthma.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^258e08ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^85d666aa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) add-on to inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta agonist (ICS-LABA) — evidence and panel assessment: Trials showed no between-group difference in the mean Asthma-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and three trials (total N = 1299) found no difference in asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.57–1.22); in two trials (N = 907) there was no difference in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (RR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42–1.52). There was also no between-group difference in the mean number of puffs of rescue medication in 24 hours (95% CI, 0.31/d less to 0.18/d more) and mortality (no deaths in either group). The Expert Panel believes that the balance of outcomes probably favors adding a LAMA to ICS-LABA instead of continuing the same dose of ICS-LABA alone, notes that using a LAMA as an add-on therapy is feasible but requires teaching individuals with asthma how to appropriately use devices that deliver the LAMA, and concludes that this approach would probably improve health equity. For comparison with doubling the inhaled corticosteroid dose while continuing the same dose of LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, a single, small, open-label RCT randomized 94 individuals on a 1:1:1 basis to add-on, once-daily tiotropium bromide 18 μg, montelukast 10 mg, or double-dose ICS; the data were insufficient to support a judgment and the Expert Panel did not find sufficient data to formulate recommendations.

### Inhaled corticosteroid therapy in adult asthma. time for a new therapeutic dose terminology [^ec55bf80]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines use the traditional terminology of "low", "medium", and "high" doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to define daily maintenance doses of 100 to 250 μg, > 250 to 500 μg, and > 500 μg, respectively, of fluticasone propionate or equivalent for adults with asthma. This concise clinical review proposes that this terminology is not evidence based and that prescribing practice based on this terminology may lead to the use of inappropriately excessive doses of ICS. Specifically, the ICS dose that achieves 80–90% of the maximum obtainable benefit is currently classified as a low dose, with the description of two higher dose levels of medium and high, which are associated with significant risk of systemic adverse effects. Asthma guidelines and clinician prescribing practice need to be modified in accordance with the currently available evidence of the dose-response relationship of ICS in adult asthma. We propose a reclassification of ICS doses based on a "standard daily dose", which is defined as 200–250 μg of fluticasone propionate or equivalent, representing the dose at which approximately 80–90% of the maximum achievable therapeutic benefit of ICS is obtained in adult asthma across the spectrum of severity. It is recommended that ICS treatment be started at these standard doses, which then represent the doses at which maintenance ICS are prescribed at step 2 and within ICS/long-acting β-agonist combination therapy at step 3. The opportunity is available to prescribe higher doses within ICS/long-acting β-agonist maintenance therapy in accordance with the stepwise approach to asthma treatment at step 4.

Asthma guideline — SMART candidate selection and counseling indicates that no patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma; the studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year and such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations; SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy; the recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control, but patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy; clinicians should inform individuals and caregivers that studies consistently showed reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids, improvement in asthma control and quality of life in some studies, no differences in harms versus ICS or ICS-LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older, and that reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid-associated harms; in children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment; this recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for reasons such as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

### A review of the burden and management of mild asthma in adults-implications for clinical practice [^af643f8b]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild asthma is present in 50–75% of patients with asthma and is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as asthma that can be well controlled with low-intensity treatments (Steps 1 and 2). Despite this definition, 'mild' asthma is often not well controlled in reality, and can have a significant impact on an individual's symptom burden and quality of life. We performed a PubMed literature search to investigate the burden of 'mild' asthma in the lives of patients, including future risk and asthma control, and the current management strategies. While clinical guidelines recommend long-term, daily, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 'mild' asthma, published data suggest that ICS are often under-prescribed or used intermittently as symptoms arise. Furthermore, patients and physicians tend to overestimate disease control, impacting the accuracy of diagnosing 'mild asthma' and subsequent management. This disconnect may be amplified by miscommunication between patients and physicians, limited objective assessment of control, and differences in guidelines. As with moderate and severe asthma, current evidence supports early initiation of regular ICS in 'mild' asthma to address the underlying inflammation, achieve symptom control and reduce risk of exacerbations. Adherence to ICS treatment is key and can be improved by educating both patients and healthcare professionals. The results of this literature search challenge the term 'mild' asthma and suggest strategies to improve the proactive management of the disease to enable patients to live symptom-free.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for adults with asthma well controlled by LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^c2bc3cad]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, as well as unscheduled hospital and clinic visits. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are commonly given to adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). US and UK regulators have issued warnings for LABA in asthma, and now recommend they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

Objectives

To compare cessation of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) versus continued use of LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) for adults whose asthma is well controlled, and to determine whether stopping LABA:1. results in loss of asthma control or deterioration in quality of life;2. increases the likelihood of asthma attacks or 'exacerbations'; or3. increases or decreases the likelihood of serious adverse events of any cause.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to April 2015, and we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least eight weeks' duration, in which adults whose asthma was well controlled by any dose of ICS+LABA combination therapy were randomly assigned to (1) step-down therapy to ICS alone versus (2) continuation of ICS and LABA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified by the search strategy. We used an Excel extraction tool to manage searches, document reasons for inclusion and exclusion and extract descriptive and numerical data from trials meeting inclusion criteria. Prespecified primary outcomes were (1) exacerbations requiring oral steroids, (2) asthma control and (3) all-cause serious adverse events.

Main Results

Six randomised, double-blind studies between 12 and 24 weeks' long met the inclusion criteria. Five studies contributed data to the meta-analysis, assigning 2781 people with stable asthma to the comparison of interest. The definition of stable asthma and inclusion criteria varied across studies, and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria were not used. Risk of bias across studies was generally low, and most evidence was rated as moderate quality. Stopping LABA might increase the number of people having exacerbations and requiring oral corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 3.65; participants = 1257; studies = 4), although the confidence intervals did not exclude the possibility that stopping LABA was beneficial; over 17 weeks, 19 people per 1000 who continued their LABA had an exacerbation, compared with 32 per 1000 when LABA were stopped (13 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 46 more). People who stopped LABA had worse scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (mean difference (MD) 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35; participants = 645; studies = 3) and on measures of asthma-related quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57; participants = 359; studies = 2) than those who continued LABA, but the effects were not clinically relevant. Too few events occurred for investigators to tell whether stopping LABA has a greater effect on serious adverse events compared with continuing LABA+ICS (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.42; participants = 1342; studies = 5), and no study reported exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation as a separate outcome. Stopping LABA may result in fewer adverse events of any kind compared with continuing, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; participants = 1339; studies = 5), and stopping LABA made people more likely to withdraw from participation in research studies (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.58; participants = 1352; studies = 5).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that stopping LABA in adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and ICS inhalers may increase the likelihood of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with oral corticosteroids, but this is not certain. Stopping LABA may slightly reduce asthma control and quality of life, but evidence was insufficient to show whether this had an effect on important outcomes such as serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission, and longer trials are warranted. Trialists should include patient-important outcomes such as asthma control and quality of life and should use validated measurement tools. Definitions of exacerbations should be provided.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^05172945]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ⩾60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

Long-term treatment of asthma

All patients diagnosed with asthma should be treated with ICS-containing medication

GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and children over 5 years with a diagnosis of asthma should be treated with regular or (for mild asthma) as-needed ICS-containing treatment to control symptoms and prevent flare-ups (also called exacerbations or "attacks"), and that they should be reviewed within three months after initiating and/or changing treatment. In children ≤ 5 years, ICS treatment is recommended if asthma is likely and the child has uncontrolled symptoms and/or ≥ 3 wheezing episodes/year; a trial of ICS is also recommended if the diagnosis is uncertain and symptoms occur more than every 6–8 weeks.

GINA recommends against treating asthma with SABA alone, without ICS

GINA no longer recommends treatment of asthma with SABA alone (without ICS) in adults, adolescents and children > 5 years (Figs. 4–6) because of the risk of severe asthma flare-ups (severe exacerbations) requiring emergency department presentation or hospitalization, and asthma-related death. These risks are markedly reduced by ICS-containing therapy. Treating with ICS also substantially reduces the need for courses of oral corticosteroids, thereby reducing the cumulative risk of long-term adverse effects such as osteoporosis and cataract from even occasional courses of oral corticosteroids. A further reason to avoid treating asthma with SABA alone is because their quick symptom relief may instill a false sense of security in patients, who may incorrectly assume that these medicines alone are a sufficient treatment for asthma. In addition, regular use of SABA (e.g. 2–4 times daily for as little as 1–2 weeks) increases airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, and overuse of SABA (indicated by dispensing of ≥ 3 200-dose canisters in a year, or daily use), is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and death, even in patients also taking ICS –.

### Dexamethasone compared to prednisone for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations [^8ea84aed]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation based on evidence demonstrating reduced hospitalizations and improved outcomes after administration in the emergency department. Although prednisone and related oral preparations have been recommended previously, researchers have assessed dexamethasone as an alternative based on its longer biologic half-life and improved palatability. Systematic reviews of multiple small trials and 2 larger trials have found no difference in revisits to the emergency department compared to prednisone for dexamethasone given either as an intramuscular injection or orally. Studies of oral administration have found reduced emesis for dexamethasone compared to prednisone both in the emergency department and for a second oral dose, typically given 24 to 48 hours later. Studies assessing a single dose of dexamethasone have found equivalent improvement at follow-up but with some evidence of increased symptoms and increased need for additional corticosteroids compared to multiple doses of prednisone. Future research could further assess dexamethasone dose, formulation, and frequency and measure other related adverse effects such as behavior change. Consideration of baseline differences within the heterogeneous population of children requiring acute care for asthma may also guide the design of an optimal dexamethasone regimen.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^7a2f7b9f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^8a2e87d8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 13 can be found in EtD Table XIX in Appendix B.

Two blinded RCTs (N = 5481) compared SMART to higher-dose ICS-LABA, in individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. SMART reduced the RR by 25% for exacerbations (high certainty of evidence). SMART also resulted in statistically significant reductions in corticosteroid use but had no significant effect on asthma quality of life or asthma control. As a result, the recommendation was conditional.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^25872990]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. Yet often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov website up to December 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32). The patients' age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β(2)-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, intermittent and daily ICS strategies did not significantly differ in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events, neither did they reach equivalence. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. The clinician should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.
