## Question

Is transvaginal ultrasound a screening tool for ovarian cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether transvaginal ultrasound should be used to screen asymptomatic, average-risk women for ovarian cancer and, if not, where TVUS appropriately fits in care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between screening and diagnostic evaluation. Then, I should review the highest-quality randomized trial evidence on mortality impact. Next, I will verify what major guidelines conclude. After that, I need to analyze harms such as false positives and unnecessary surgery. Then, I will clarify situations where TVUS is appropriate, including diagnostic workups and high-risk surveillance. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and double-check for any exceptions or subgroups I might be missing.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I do not conflate screening with diagnosis. Screening targets asymptomatic, average-risk populations to reduce mortality, while diagnostic evaluation investigates symptoms or abnormal findings; that distinction is critical because a test can be useful diagnostically yet harmful as a screening tool due to low prevalence and false positives in the general population, and guidelines explicitly draw this line for ovarian cancer tools like TVUS and CA-125 in average-risk women [^114gZbc6] [^1131bMsk].

> Next, I should review the randomized evidence on mortality reduction, because that is the decisive outcome for screening. Large RCTs, including UKCTOCS and PLCO, show that neither annual TVUS alone nor strategies incorporating TVUS reduce ovarian cancer mortality compared with no screening; even with extended follow-up in UKCTOCS, there was no mortality benefit despite earlier signals of a stage shift with multimodal screening, which could have been misleading if taken at face value without mature mortality data — so I need to be cautious about inferring benefit from stage distribution alone [^114n629Z] [^113UN7Fb] [^111UR7gt] [^111e1WBz] [^112hEmSL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking guideline convergence. The USPSTF gives a D recommendation against screening asymptomatic women with pelvic ultrasound or CA-125; ACOG similarly finds insufficient evidence to support TVUS or CA-125 for early detection in average-risk patients; and primary care guidance aligns, advising against ovarian cancer screening in non–high-risk asymptomatic patients; recent radiology appropriateness criteria also conclude RCTs do not demonstrate a mortality benefit for ultrasound screening in average-risk patients [^114gZbc6] [^1131bMsk] [^1171yZcK] [^1128pXRs].

> I should double-check the balance of harms versus benefits, because screening decisions hinge on net clinical value. The evidence shows high false-positive rates with low positive predictive value in average-risk populations; TVUS screening has led to many surgeries per cancer detected with meaningful complication rates, and false positives are associated with increased cancer-specific distress, reinforcing that harms can be moderate to substantial in relation to no proven mortality benefit [^112hEmSL] [^111e1WBz] [^111UFsdo].

> Now, I will examine where TVUS is appropriate so I do not discard its diagnostic utility. TVUS is the first-line imaging modality of choice to evaluate a suspected or incidentally identified adnexal mass, and structured ultrasound risk models (for example, IOTA simple rules) help stratify risk and standardize management pathways; specialty society guidelines across gynecologic oncology and radiology consistently endorse TVUS in the diagnostic workup of masses rather than as population screening [^112ZqXmf] [^113AraQS] [^116LyW2P] [^112aSH9m].

> But wait, what about women at increased genetic risk; should TVUS be used to screen them routinely? Let me verify. Even in high-risk groups such as BRCA carriers, routine screening with TVUS or CA-125 has not shown mortality benefit and is not recommended as a substitute for risk-reducing surgery; short-term surveillance with TVUS and/or CA-125 can be considered starting around age 30–35 until risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, but definitive risk reduction relies on surgery, not screening [^113Ed69M] [^113KMSNo] [^114BM3av].

> Let me synthesize and ensure I am not missing any subgroup where population screening might help. We have concordant RCT evidence showing no mortality reduction with TVUS screening, convergent national and international guidelines recommending against screening asymptomatic, average-risk women, and documented harms from false positives and unnecessary surgeries that outweigh unproven benefits; therefore, TVUS should not be used as a population screening tool for ovarian cancer, but it remains the recommended first-line diagnostic imaging for suspected adnexal masses and may be used only as temporary surveillance in select high-risk women until they undergo risk-reducing surgery [^114gZbc6] [^113UN7Fb] [^112ZqXmf] [^113Ed69M].

---

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) **should not be used for routine screening** [^114gZbc6] for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women [^1131bMsk], as it does not reduce mortality [^111UR7gt] and has a high false-positive rate [^112hEmSL] that leads to unnecessary surgeries and complications [^111e1WBz]. TVUS is appropriate for **evaluating symptomatic patients** [^112ZqXmf] or **known adnexal masses** [^113AraQS] but is not recommended for routine screening in average- or high-risk women [^1171yZcK]. For high-risk women, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is the preferred strategy [^113Ed69M]; TVUS may be considered only if surgery is declined or delayed [^114BM3av] [^113KMSNo].

---

## Evidence from major clinical trials

Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated TVUS for ovarian cancer screening [^111e1WBz], **with no demonstrated mortality reduction** [^111UR7gt]:

- **PLCO trial**: No reduction in ovarian cancer mortality [^114gZbc6] with annual TVUS and CA-125 [^111e1WBz]; high false-positive rates led to unnecessary surgeries and complications.

- **UKCTOCS**: No significant mortality reduction [^111UR7gt] with TVUS alone or multimodal screening (CA-125 plus TVUS) [^114n629Z]; TVUS alone had lower sensitivity and specificity than multimodal approaches [^11664iqZ].

- **Systematic reviews**: Consistently show no mortality benefit [^112hEmSL] and substantial harms from false positives and unnecessary surgeries [^111e1WBz].

---

## Sensitivity and specificity of TVUS

TVUS has moderate sensitivity and specificity [^1128pXRs], **with significant limitations** [^11664iqZ]:

| **Metric** | **TVUS alone** | **TVUS + CA-125** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 84% | 85% |
| Specificity | 98% | 96% |
| False-positive rate | 9.8% | 5.3% |

---

False positives lead to **unnecessary surgeries** [^112hEmSL], anxiety, and complications [^115fjme9], whereas **false negatives** miss early-stage cancers [^111e1WBz], limiting effectiveness [^112hEmSL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations **recommend against routine TVUS screening**:

- **USPSTF**: Recommends against screening asymptomatic women, including those at average or high risk.

- **ACOG**: Recommends against routine TVUS screening in asymptomatic women, including those with BRCA mutations or family history [^113Ed69M].

- **SOGC**: Recommends against routine TVUS screening in asymptomatic women [^116LyW2P].

---

## Risks and harms associated with TVUS screening

TVUS screening carries **significant risks and harms**:

- **False positives**: Lead to unnecessary surgeries [^111e1WBz], anxiety, and complications [^115fjme9] [^112hEmSL].

- **False negatives**: Miss early-stage cancers [^112hEmSL], delaying diagnosis and treatment [^1128pXRs].

- **Psychological impact**: Increased anxiety and distress [^111e1WBz] from false positives [^112hEmSL].

---

## TVUS in high-risk populations

TVUS is **not recommended for routine screening** [^1128pXRs] in high-risk populations. For women with **BRCA mutations**, there is no evidence of mortality reduction, and **risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is preferred** [^114BM3av] [^113Ed69M]. Similarly, for those with a **family history**, there is no evidence of mortality reduction, with **risk-reducing surgery preferred** [^114BM3av] [^111dCGEw].

---

## Alternative screening methods

Alternative methods have been evaluated, but **none are recommended for routine screening** [^114gZbc6]. CA-125 has **limited sensitivity and specificity** [^111e1WBz] and is not recommended alone or with TVUS [^1131bMsk]; **multimodal screening** [^114n629Z] likewise shows no significant mortality reduction and is not recommended [^111UR7gt].

---

## Current role of TVUS in clinical practice

TVUS is **valuable for diagnostic evaluation** of symptomatic patients or known adnexal masses. For **symptomatic patients**, TVUS is recommended for evaluating suspected ovarian cancer [^112ZqXmf] [^112aSH9m]; for **known adnexal masses**, it is recommended for initial evaluation and characterization [^113AraQS] [^116LWpKe].

---

TVUS is **not recommended for routine ovarian cancer screening** [^114gZbc6] in asymptomatic women because of the lack of mortality benefit [^111UR7gt] and the significant harms from false positives [^111e1WBz]. It remains useful for evaluating symptomatic patients or known adnexal masses; for high-risk women, risk-reducing surgery is preferred [^113Ed69M].

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2021 update [^114BM3av]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there are no documented effective screening methods that reduce the mortality of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers. Studies using CA125, ultrasonography of the pelvis, and pelvic examination do not have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity based on trials carried out in women in the general population and those in the high-risk population. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer with pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound, or serum tumor marker measurements.

The low prevalence of disease and lack of high-quality screening methods make it more likely to obtain false-positive results, leading to unnecessary interventions. A recent study of multimodal screening using CA125, based on a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) every 4 months and transvaginal ultrasound annually or earlier where indicated by the ROCA in women at high risk of ovarian cancer, reported that screening was associated with a low rate of high-volume disease at primary surgery and very high rates of no residual disease after surgery. Given that the majority of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, even with complete resection, will relapse after chemotherapy, this does not seem to be a good alternative to risk-reducing surgery. The authors of the screening study concluded that risk-reducing salpingectomy-oophorectomy remains the treatment choice for women at high risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.

Women at increased genetic risk should be encouraged to consider risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

### Risks and benefits of screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hEmSL]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risks and benefits of screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL, without language restrictions, from January 1, 1979, to February 5, 2012. Eligible studies randomly assigned asymptomatic women to screening or usual care. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data using a standardized, piloted extraction form, and assessed bias and strength of inference for each outcome using the GRADE framework. Chance-corrected agreement was calculated at each step, and disagreements were resolved through consensus.

- **Results**: Ten randomized trials proved eligible. Screening did not reduce all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.06), ovarian cancer-specific mortality (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.84–1.38), or risk of diagnosis at an advanced stage (RR of diagnosis at FIGO stages III-IV = 0.86, 95% CI 0.68–1.11). Transvaginal ultrasound resulted in a mean of 38 surgeries per ovarian cancer detected (95% CI 15.7–178.1), while screening with CA-125 led to 4 surgeries per ovarian cancer detected (95% CI 2.7–4.5). Surgery was associated with severe complications in 6% of women (95% CI 1%-11%). Quality of life was not affected by screening; however, women with false-positive results had increased cancer-specific distress compared to those with normal results (odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% CI 1.23–3.99).

- **Conclusions**: Screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer does not reduce mortality or diagnosis at an advanced stage.

### The role of ultrasound evaluation in the detection of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer [^112yYVAX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer kills more women than all other gynecologic malignancies combined due to our inability to detect early-stage disease. Ultrasonography has demonstrated usefulness in detecting ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women; however, its value for detecting early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer in women at increased risk remains uncertain. We examined the usefulness of sonography in detecting early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer in asymptomatic high-risk women who participated in the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program.

- **Study design**: Only asymptomatic women at increased risk for developing ovarian cancer with initial normal gynecologic and ultrasound examinations were eligible to participate in the institutional review board-approved National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program. Participants underwent comprehensive gynecologic and ultrasound examinations every 6 months. Increased risk includes women with at least one affected first-degree relative with ovarian cancer, a personal history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer, at least one affected first- and second-degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer, inheritance of a breast cancer mutation from an affected family member, or membership in a recognized cancer syndrome.

- **Results**: The average age of the 4,526 women evaluated was 46 years; 2,610 women were premenopausal, and 1,916 women were postmenopausal. A total of 12,709 scans have been performed since 1990. Visualization of both ovaries was noted in 98% of premenopausal and in 94% of postmenopausal women.

### Frequency and disposition of ovarian abnormalities followed with serial transvaginal ultrasonography [^1121TjsM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

To examine the prevalence, incidence, persistence, and resolution of ovarian abnormalities, serial transvaginal ultrasonography was utilized. A group of 39,337 women in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Program were monitored, involving 221,576 baseline and interval transvaginal ultrasonography sessions.

The results revealed that the transvaginal ultrasonogram was normal for both the initial and all subsequent visits in 31,834 participants (80.9%). However, 6,807 women (17.3%) had transvaginal ultrasonograms interpreted as abnormal, leading to 21,588 monitoring ultrasonograms. Ovarian cysts were more prevalent in premenopausal women (prevalence 34.9%, incidence 15.3%) than in postmenopausal women (prevalence 17.0%, incidence 8.2%).

For the group with abnormalities, the initial transvaginal ultrasonogram was abnormal in 46.7% of the cases, although 63.2% of these resolved to normal in subsequent ultrasonograms. Among the 35,314 cases classified as normal on the initial examination, 9.9% were found to be abnormal on subsequent annual examinations. The abnormal findings were categorized as unilocular cysts (11.5%), cysts with septations (9.8%), cysts with solid areas (7.1%), and solid masses (1.8%). Many transvaginal ultrasonographic abnormalities were followed to resolution. Surgery was performed on 557 participants, resulting in the identification of 85 ovarian malignancies and 472 nonmalignancies. Over the study's duration, the positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 8.1% to 24.7%.

Serial ultrasonography has demonstrated that many ovarian abnormalities resolve, even if the initial appearance is complex or solid.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^112umqQD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

We found several relevant guidelines for the management of incidentally identified masses. According to the ACOG, "transvaginal ultrasonography is the recommended imaging modality for a suspected or incidentally identified pelvic mass. No alternative imaging modality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to transvaginal sonography to justify routine use". The American College of Radiology's Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System ultrasound risk-stratification and management system recommends ultrasound follow-up, referral to an ultrasound specialist, pursuing magnetic resonance imaging, or referral to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist on the basis of the risk of malignancy (Table 2 in Appendix 6 provides more information).

Most relevant guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Society for Medical Oncology, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, make no mention of the use of serum biomarker panels. The ACOG states, "Serum biomarker panels may be used as an alternative to CA 125 level alone in determining the need for referral to or consultation with a gynecologic oncologist when an adnexal mass requires surgery. These biomarker panels are not recommended for use in the initial evaluation of an adnexal mass but may be helpful in assessing which women would benefit from referral to a gynecologic oncologist" (Appendix 6 provides a complete evidence summary).

### Risk algorithm using serial biomarker measurements doubles the number of screen-detected cancers compared with a single-threshold rule in the United Kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening [^116MpieM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Following the initial prevalence screen, trial participants underwent an annual blood test on the anniversary of the randomization date. Serum CA-125, also known as level I screen, was measured using an electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay (Catalog No. 11776223 322; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The screening protocol and management of screen-detected abnormalities have been previously described.

- **Screen triage process**: At the annual screen, women were triaged as follows: risk of ovarian cancer (ROC) normal, return to annual screening; ROC intermediate, repeat CA-125 (repeat level I screen) in 12 weeks; and ROC elevated, repeat CA-125, and transvaginal scan (TVS; level II screen) in 6 weeks, with earlier screens arranged when results are suggestive of clinical disease.

- **Level II screening**: At level II screen, women with normal or intermediate ROC and a normal scan were returned to annual screening. Those with elevated ROC and a normal scan or an unsatisfactory scan irrespective of ROC had a repeat level II screen in 6 weeks. Women with abnormal scans irrespective of ROC were referred for clinical assessment. At repeat level II, women were again triaged to annual screening or clinical assessment.

Women with an ROC of more than 1 in 5 (severe risk) were recommended to have surgery irrespective of scan findings.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^111HbTHh]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Overarching clinical question A**: What are the optimal diagnosis and staging strategies for adult women with ovarian masses and/or EOC?

- **Evaluation and diagnosis of adult women with ovarian masses or symptoms of EOC**: Recommendations on evaluation and diagnosis for women with ovarian masses are provided in Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Figures A1, A2, A8, and A9. These recommendations are adapted, and in some cases modified, from the guidelines from the developers Belgian KCE, Irish NCEC, SIGN, BGCS, and ASCO and SGO and informed by clinical expertise.

- **Diagnostic strategies discussion**: These recommendations concern assessment for adult women with ovarian masses in basic, limited, and enhanced settings.

- **Basic-resource settings**: Women with ovarian cancer may report generalized symptoms of pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal bloating, or feeling full with small meals or early satiety. Other focal signs can include a patient's report of a mass noted in the abdomen or symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal or pelvic pain, and change in bowel function with diarrhea or constipation (for the latter, symptoms of less than 12 months duration and occurring more than 12 times per month). Women presenting with symptoms associated with possible EOC require an evaluation. The cause of underlying symptoms, generally nonspecific but potentially severe or life-impacting in nature, needs to be determined and may lead to a potential cancer diagnosis. A general practitioner in a basic-resource setting has to rely on the patient's history and physical examination.

### Management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women [^111PVfYr]. RCOG (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, particularly in the monitoring of ovarian cysts, the BSGE/RCOG 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining annual ultrasound surveillance in patients with simple ovarian cysts measuring 5–7 cm in diameter. For patients with larger simple cysts, the guidelines suggest considering further imaging with MRI or offering surgical intervention.

### Ovarian cancer prevention and screening [^111NZ4Ti]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Recent progress in ovarian cancer screening and prevention has led to improved tools that combine genetic and epidemiologic factors to tailor preventive and screening approaches for individuals. There is increasing evidence pointing to the tubal origins of a proportion of ovarian cancers, which has supported the use of opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy during tubal ligation and hysterectomy in the general population. Clinical trials are underway to estimate the long-term effects on endocrine function.

In women at high risk, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy remains the standard of care, with a focus on managing resulting noncancer outcomes, particularly sexual dysfunction in younger women. Consequently, early bilateral salpingectomy followed by delayed oophorectomy is being evaluated in this population.

Modeling suggests that BRCA mutation carriers might benefit from using oral contraceptive pills for chemoprevention. In the general population, the largest ovarian cancer screening trial at the time of writing, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening, reported a stage shift with annual multimodal screening using the longitudinal CA 125 Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm, but not with annual transvaginal ultrasound screening. Neither screening strategy resulted in a definitive mortality reduction when compared with no screening. Further follow-up was underway until December 2018. Stage shift and higher rates of optimal cytoreduction were also observed during 3- to 4-monthly multimodal screening.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® ovarian cancer screening: 2024 update [^1128pXRs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains low in prevalence but has the highest mortality of all gynecologic malignancies. Population-based screening for ovarian cancer is a significant topic in contemporary practice, given that most cancers encountered are high-grade aggressive malignancies, for which favorable survival is achieved in early-stage disease.

This document summarizes a review of the available data from randomized and observational trials that have evaluated the role of imaging for ovarian cancer screening in average-risk and high-risk patients. When considering screening using pelvic ultrasound in average-risk patients, there is insufficient published evidence to recommend ovarian cancer screening; randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in this context. Screening with pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate for select patients at high risk, although the existing data remain limited as large, randomized trials have not been performed in this setting.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging for specific clinical conditions.

### Ultrasound and ovarian cancer screening: Is there a future [^112tjPhf]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death due to gynecologic malignant disease. Advances in ultrasound have improved the ability to identify the more subtle characteristics of adnexal masses, resulting in an increasing volume of research addressing its use to accurately predict whether masses are benign or malignant, and the inclusion of ultrasound in large-scale studies addressing screening for ovarian cancer. Herein, we explore some of the factors that make screening for ovarian cancer challenging, review the major trials addressing the effect of ovarian cancer screening, and examine data relating to more recent advances in ultrasound technology.

### Estimating sojourn time and sensitivity of screening for ovarian cancer using a Bayesian framework [^113pHnES]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is among the leading causes of gynecologic cancer-related death. Past ovarian cancer screening trials using a combination of cancer antigen 125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound failed to yield statistically significant mortality reduction. Estimates of ovarian cancer sojourn time — that is, the period from when the cancer is first screen detectable until clinical detection — may inform future screening programs.

- **Methods**: We modeled ovarian cancer progression as a continuous-time Markov chain and estimated screening modality-specific sojourn time and sensitivity using a Bayesian approach. Model inputs were derived from the screening arms (multimodal and ultrasound) of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trials. We assessed the quality of our estimates by using the posterior predictive P value. We derived histology-specific sojourn times by adjusting the overall sojourn time based on the corresponding histology-specific survival from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.

- **Results**: The overall ovarian cancer sojourn time was 2.1 years (posterior predictive P value = .469) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian studies, with 65.7% screening sensitivity. The sojourn time was 2.0 years (posterior predictive P value = .532) in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening's multimodal screening arm and 2.4 years (posterior predictive P value = .640) in the ultrasound screening arm, with sensitivities of 93.2% and 64.5%, respectively.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^112zL5mj]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Guideline implementation

ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among frontline practitioners and patients with ovarian cancer and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate the implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely, including through many forms of ASCO communications and the ASCO website.

### When evidence says no: Gynaecologists' reasons for (not) recommending ineffective ovarian cancer screening [^115HuNf5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). Low credibility.

Most patients likely assume that physicians offer medical procedures backed by solid, scientific evidence that demonstrates their superiority — or at least non-inferiority — to alternative approaches. Doing otherwise would waste healthcare resources urgently needed elsewhere in the system and also jeopardise patient health and safety, as well as undermine patients' trust in medicine and care.

In some instances, however, physicians' healthcare practices appear to act against scientific evidence. For example, evidence from two large randomised controlled trials on ovarian cancer screening's effectiveness showed that the screening has no mortality benefits — neither cancer-specific nor overall — in average-risk women, but considerable harms, including false-positive surgeries in women without ovarian cancer. Consequently, the US Preventive Services Task Force and medical associations worldwide recommend against ovarian cancer screening.

Nevertheless, a considerable number of US gynaecologists persist in recommending the screening to average-risk women. To understand why physicians continue using a practice called into question by scientific evidence, we investigated gynaecologists' reasons for, or against recommending ovarian cancer screening, their assumptions about why other gynaecologists recommend it, and the association between their knowledge of basic concepts of cancer screening statistics and recommendation behaviour.

### Risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 centimeters in diameter [^115xkQte]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the natural history and estimate the risk of malignancy of unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter, these tumors were followed conservatively using transvaginal ultrasound.

From 1987 to 2002, 15,106 asymptomatic women at least 50 years old participated in the University of Kentucky's Ovarian Cancer Screening Program and underwent initial transvaginal ultrasonography. If no abnormalities were found, the women were asked to repeat the transvaginal ultrasonography yearly. If abnormalities were detected, transvaginal ultrasonography was repeated in 4 to 6 weeks, along with Doppler flow ultrasonography and CA 125 testing.

Of these 15,106 women, 2,763 (18%) were diagnosed with 3,259 unilocular ovarian cysts. A total of 2,261 (69.4%) of these cysts resolved spontaneously, 537 (16.5%) developed a septum, 189 (5.8%) developed a solid area, and 220 (6.8%) persisted as a unilocular lesion. During this period, 27 women received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Ten of these women had previously been diagnosed with simple ovarian cysts. However, all ten developed another morphologic abnormality, experienced resolution of the cyst before developing cancer, or developed cancer in the contralateral ovary. No woman with an isolated unilocular cystic ovarian tumor developed ovarian cancer in this population.

In conclusion, the risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter in women 50 years old or older is extremely low. The majority will resolve spontaneously and can be followed conservatively through transvaginal ultrasound.

### Ovarian cancer screening and mortality in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): A randomised controlled trial [^114n629Z]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with just 40% of patients surviving 5 years. This trial was designed to establish the effect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality.

In this randomised controlled trial, postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years were recruited from 13 centers in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria included previous bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. Eligibility was confirmed by the trial management system, and participants were randomly allocated in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers. They were assigned to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening in a 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by Dec 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening, determined by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modified intention to screen, excluding the small number of women found after randomisation to have a bilateral oophorectomy, ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were aware of the screening type.

Between June 1, 2001, and Oct 21, 2005, 202,638 women were randomly allocated: 50,640 (25.0%) to MMS, 50,639 (25.0%) to USS, and 101,359 (50.0%) to no screening. More than 99.9% of the 202,546 women…

With regard to screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, particularly concerning indications for screening and identifying patients at risk, the USPSTF 2014 guidelines recommend screening for ovarian cancer in patients with a family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. This should be done using a screening tool designed to identify an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 or BRCA2.

### Ovarian cancer screening — current status, future directions [^117U6Rwd]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that screening can impact cancer-specific mortality. Many countries have national screening programs for breast, bowel, and cervical cancers, with the latter associated with a significant (50–90%) reduction in disease-specific mortality. Key to the success of these strategies has been an understanding of the natural history of cancer and the existence of a precursor lesion.

Evidence of a mortality benefit continues to elude ovarian cancer (OC) screening, and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recently reconfirmed their previous recommendation that it should not be undertaken in the general population. However, a number of novel insights in recent years into disease etiology, evolution, and biomarker discovery suggest that a new era in screening is underway. The article reviews the evidence from recently reported OC screening trials and explores the impact of the growing understanding of OC on future screening strategies.

### Sensitivity of transvaginal ultrasound screening for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women: a case-control study within the UKCTOCS cohort [^114eA6YD]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

The increase in the worldwide incidence of endometrial cancer relates to rising obesity, falling fertility, and the ageing of the population. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is a possible screening test, but there have been no large-scale studies; we report the performance of TVS screening in a large cohort.

- **Methods**: We did a nested case-control study of postmenopausal women who underwent TVS in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) following recruitment between April 17, 2001, and Sept 29, 2005. Endometrial thickness and endometrial abnormalities were recorded, and follow-up, through national registries and a postal questionnaire, documented the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Our primary outcome measure was endometrial cancer and atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). Performance characteristics of endometrial thickness and abnormalities for the detection of endometrial cancer within 1 year of TVS were calculated. Epidemiological variables were used to develop a logistic regression model and assess a screening strategy for women at higher risk. Our study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032, and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial register, number ISRCTN22488978.

- **Findings**: 48,230 women underwent TVS in the UKCTOCS prevalence screen. 9078 women were ineligible because they had undergone a hysterectomy and 2271 because their endometrial thickness had not been recorded; however, 157 of these women had an endometrial abnormality on TVS and were included in the analysis.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: a systematic review [^115fjme9]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

While many advanced methodologies, such as multimarker blood assays and imaging techniques, have shown increased accuracy over traditional methods, finding the ideal balance to minimize false positives has remained a challenge. This underscores the importance of continued research and development of more precise diagnostic tools for ovarian cancer. Future research must continue to concentrate on these distinctions, enhancing models to identify high-risk individuals and examining the broader implications of false-positive results. This includes not only the direct complications from unneeded surgeries but also the impact on patients' quality of life and overall well-being. Such investigations will contribute to a more intricate understanding of risk versus benefit and the feasibility of tailored screening strategies. This nuanced approach is fundamental to a screening strategy that ensures patients receive the benefits from screening while avoiding the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

While this study provides meaningful insights into false-positive rates and subsequent unnecessary surgical interventions, several notable limitations exist. First, the retrospective nature of the included studies introduces potential biases and confounding factors. Second, the heterogeneity in study designs and screening methods under investigation may limit the generalizability of our findings. The limited number of studies might also contribute to a lack of generalizability. For example, only four studies addressed complications, preventing us from discussing the impact and severity of these complications fully.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^115oQWh7]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The clinical practice guidelines and other guidance provided herein by ASCO aim to assist providers in clinical decision-making. It is essential to note that the information should not be solely relied upon as complete or accurate, nor should it be considered comprehensive regarding all treatments or methods of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read.

The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. It specifically addresses only the topics explicitly identified and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Additionally, it is not intended to substitute the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients.

Recommendations indicate varying levels of confidence — high, moderate, or low — regarding the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must", "must not", "should", and "should not" suggest whether a course of action is recommended or not for either most or many patients. However, there is flexibility for the treating physician to select alternative courses of action in individual cases. In all situations, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider within the context of the individual patient.

### Sensitivity and specificity of multimodal and ultrasound screening for ovarian cancer, and stage distribution of detected cancers: Results of the prevalence screen of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) [^11664iqZ]. The Lancet Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a high case-fatality ratio, with most women not diagnosed until the disease is in its advanced stages. The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the effect of screening on mortality. This report summarizes the outcome of the prevalence (initial) screen in UKCTOCS.

Methods: Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 202,638 post-menopausal women aged 50–74 years were randomly assigned to no treatment (control; n = 101,359); annual CA125 screening (interpreted using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm) with transvaginal ultrasound scan as a second-line test (multimodal screening [MMS]; n = 50,640); or annual screening with transvaginal ultrasound (USS; n = 50,639) alone in a 2:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random number algorithm. All women provided a blood sample at recruitment. Women randomized to the MMS group had their blood tested for CA125, and those randomized to the USS group were sent an appointment to attend for a transvaginal scan. Women with abnormal screens had repeat tests. Women with persistent abnormality on repeat screens underwent clinical evaluation and, where appropriate, surgery. This trial is registered as ISRCTN22488978 and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032.

Findings: In the prevalence screen, 50,078 (98.9%) women underwent MMS, and 48,230 (95.2%) underwent USS. The main reasons for withdrawal were death (two MMS, 28 USS), non-ovarian cancer or other disease (none MMS, 66 USS), removal of ovaries (five MMS, 29 USS), and relocation.

### Ultrasound screening for the early detection of ovarian cancer [^116mbyKk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer screening in the general population has been performed using ultrasound examination of the female pelvis and serum tumor marker determinations. Ultrasound examinations, particularly transvaginal sonography (TVS), have been advocated as potentially useful modalities. Investigators from the University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY) and Hirosaki University (Hirosaki, Japan) have recently published results from ultrasound-based ovarian cancer screening studies.

The Kentucky trial screened 14,469 women using TVS on an annual basis. One hundred eighty women underwent surgery, and 17 ovarian cancers were detected, 11 of which were invasive epithelial lesions. The Hirosaki trial reported the results of an ultrasound-based screening study among 51,550 women who were first-time participants. Three hundred twenty-four women underwent surgery, and 22 ovarian cancers were detected. In each of these trials, the positive predictive value of gray-scale sonography was low.

- **Morphologic tumor indexing and Doppler examinations**: Both have been proposed as potential second-line studies, which could increase the positive predictive value of gray-scale ultrasound. A review of these techniques is presented.

At present, ovarian cancer screening in the general population using ultrasound examinations is an experimental technique. Further studies are needed to determine whether second-line testing can improve the positive predictive value of gray-scale sonography such that asymptomatic women do not undergo unnecessary surgery for benign masses.

### Update in women's health for the general internist [^111xzGGT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This section discusses the findings from four rounds of ovarian cancer screening in a randomized trial.

Annually in the United States, over 22,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and over 15,000 die from the disease. Prognosis is greatly improved when diagnosis occurs at an early stage (Stage I or II) compared to later stages. At the time of writing, attempts to screen for ovarian cancer using either transvaginal ultrasound or CA125 tumor marker levels have not reduced mortality.

This study examined whether screening with both transvaginal ultrasound and CA125 would reduce mortality from ovarian cancer. Over 34,000 women aged 55–74 years were randomized to annual transvaginal ultrasound and CA125 versus usual care for four years. If either test was positive, management was per the patient's personal physician. At the baseline screen, 5.8% of women were positive for either test, and 33.8% of them (n = 566) underwent biopsy, resulting in the diagnosis of 18 new ovarian cancers (83% were Stage III or IV). By the end of the fourth round of screening, 42 additional invasive cancers were diagnosed (67% late stage). With each round of screening, the number of cancers diagnosed per 10,000 women screened ranged from 4.7 to 5.9. The ratio of surgery to invasive cancer was 31:1 at the baseline screen and decreased to 14:1 by the end of round 4. Cases detected by ultrasound only (normal CA125) tended to be early stage (71% of 14 cases), but these drove most of the unnecessary surgeries. Cases detected by elevated CA125 (regardless of ultrasound) predicted late stage (79–89%).

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^111Z7cKA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded funding to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop educational materials for clinicians on gynecologic cancers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a panel of experts in evidence review from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology and content experts from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to review relevant literature, best practices, and existing practice guidelines. This was a first step toward developing evidence-based educational materials for women's health care clinicians about ovarian cancer.

Panel members conducted structured literature reviews, which were then reviewed by other panel members and discussed at a virtual meeting of stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations in February 2022. This article is the executive summary of the relevant literature and existing recommendations to guide clinicians in the prevention, early diagnosis, and special considerations of ovarian cancer. Substantive knowledge gaps are noted and summarized to provide guidance for future research.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^111UFsdo]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Additionally, the observed variability in false-positive rates across studies could be partly attributed to the inherent limitations of the screening methods. For example, previous studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is highly dependent on the operator's experience. Timmerman et al. analyzed the use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of adnexal masses, finding that experienced operators were more accurate (91%) compared with less experienced operators (82%–87%). Similar findings have been observed in other disease sites, where there was notable variation in radiological assessments based on the individual. This highlights the need for the involvement of clinicians experienced in the use of ultrasound prior to discussions around surgery, particularly for individuals presenting with clinically ambiguous lesions on initial imaging.

Only four studies reported on the physical consequences of unnecessary surgical interventions. The results from these studies indicate that approximately 15% of individuals experienced complications, including perforation, blood loss, bowel injury, fainting, and bruising. In the study by Buys et al, it was found that of the 1080 patients who underwent surgery for a false-positive result, 163 experienced major complications. The limited data on complications from ovarian cancer screening highlight a critical gap in understanding the physical impacts on patients. For instance, a study focusing on colorectal cancer screenings found surgery to be the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the colorectal screening program.

### Ovarian cancer screening in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer [^113PqjBU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the positive predictive values of CA 125 or transvaginal ultrasonography screening for ovarian cancer according to family history of breast or ovarian cancer, a study was conducted.

In the screening arm of a randomized controlled trial of screening compared with usual care, 28,460 women with family history data received baseline and annual CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography examinations. The CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography results from the first four rounds of screening were analyzed.

Women were classified as average (n = 22,687), moderate (n = 2,572), or high (n = 2,163) risk based on family history, or high risk due to a personal history of breast cancer (n = 1,038). Cancers were identified by active follow-up of women with abnormal screening results and annual questionnaires. Positive predictive values for screening combinations were calculated.

Similar proportions (4.8–5.0%) of women in each group had abnormal screening results. Higher-risk women were more likely than lower-risk women to undergo biopsy following a positive screen. Screening identified 43 invasive ovarian cancers. The positive predictive values for abnormal screening results were 0.7% in average-risk, 1.3% in moderate-risk, and 1.6% in high-risk groups; one ovarian cancer occurred among the breast cancer survivors. The positive predictive values for postbaseline abnormal screening results were also higher in the higher-risk groups. The positive predictive values did not significantly differ across risk groups.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^1164rrFn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to create and disseminate educational material for clinicians on the early diagnosis and prevention of gynecologic cancers and early-onset breast cancer. Ovarian cancer is relatively rare, ranking 17th among all cancers in the United States, with an incidence of 10.6 per 100,000 from 2015 to 2019. However, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the United States and is the deadliest form of gynecologic cancer. Because of its high mortality rate, ovarian cancer was chosen as the second gynecologic cancer for educational material development.

To ensure that these materials were based on the most comprehensive literature and guidelines, an extensive literature review was conducted. This article serves as the evidence summary, which is detailed in Appendices 2–8, available online. The health care professional educational material is available online.

### Ovarian cancer population screening and mortality after long-term follow-up in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^113UN7Fb]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly of all gynaecological cancers. Most patients (58%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage (III or IV), which is associated with poor survival (5-year survival is 27% for stage III and 13% for stage IV ovarian cancer). The greater than 90% survival rates in women detected at stage I have spurred international efforts in early detection, spanning across four decades. All trials have used combinations of the biomarker CA125 and pelvic imaging using transvaginal ultrasound scans (TVS). Despite these extensive endeavours, at the time of writing, there is no evidence that screening for ovarian cancer saves lives.

In our multicentre randomised trial (UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening [UKCTOCS]), 202,638 women from the general population were randomly assigned to two annual screening groups — multimodal screening (MMS; longitudinal CA125 and second line TVS) and ultrasound screening (USS; TVS first and second-line test) — and a no screening group. We reported previously (median follow-up of 11.1 years) that an absolute proportion of 13% more women with ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer were diagnosed with stage I or II disease in the MMS group than in the no screening group. There was no change in stage in the USS group. There was no evidence of a reduction in disease-specific deaths in either screened group compared with the no screening group using the Cox version of the log-rank test. The observed reduction in deaths was delayed, and the cumulative mortality curves appeared to be diverging at the time of previous reporting.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1177zHPX]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

With approximately 14,000 deaths per year, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths occur among women 45 years and older.

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for ovarian cancer, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. High risk includes women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes that increase their risk for ovarian cancer. Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases. These harms include unnecessary surgery for women who do not have cancer. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefit. The net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative.

The USPSTF recommends that…

### Ovarian cancer screening — current status, future directions [^113u3VCT]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence of a mortality benefit continues to elude ovarian cancer (OC) screening. Data from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which used a screening strategy incorporating CA125 cut-off and transvaginal ultrasound, have not shown a mortality benefit. The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) is using the Risk of Ovarian Cancer (ROC) time series algorithm to interpret CA125, which has shown encouraging sensitivity and specificity; however, the mortality data will only be available in 2015.

The article explores the impact of growing insights into disease etiology and evolution and biomarker discovery on future screening strategies. A better understanding of the target lesion, improved design of biomarker discovery studies, focusing on detecting low-volume disease using cancer-specific markers, novel biospecimens such as cervical cytology and targeted imaging, and the use of time series algorithms for interpreting marker profiles suggest that a new era in screening is underway.

### Adnexal tumors in menopausal women: Surgery or surveillance [^115T27q9]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic ovarian tumors in menopausal women do not always require surgical removal. Experts recommend an initial evaluation with transvaginal ultrasound to help characterize the tumor's malignant risk.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer [^1149bW4k]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Early detection is the only way to achieve a high cure rate in women with ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there is no effective strategy for early detection, despite rapidly emerging biomarkers. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer, low specificity, and high rates of false positives have been limitations of screening programs. In the hands of experts, transvaginal sonography and MRI are effective tools to characterize ovarian masses.

Currently, ongoing efforts in standardization of technique and analysis are likely to improve diagnostic capabilities in clinical routine, as well as the introduction of predictive risk models of malignancy. Radiomics and radiogenomics potentially offer a broad spectrum of complementary information in ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment.

- **Key points**:
	- Transvaginal sonography and MRI are effective tools to characterize ovarian masses.
	- Standardization of imaging technique and implementation of predictive models of risk of malignancy contribute to early detection of ovarian cancer.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^116zgbuT]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Early detection of ovarian cancer significantly enhances patient outcomes and improves overall survival rates, yet the disease frequently remains undetected until it has reached advanced stages, resulting in a poor 5-year survival rate. This underscores the necessity for efficient screening strategies to identify the disease at an earlier stage, which can markedly improve both treatment results and survival. Nevertheless, the United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend specific methods for routine ovarian cancer screening.

In the absence of recommended methods, serum tumor biomarkers and imaging techniques such as cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) have been traditionally used for diagnosing ovarian cancer in symptomatic patients and are also being considered as potential screening tools. However, these methods are prone to producing false-positive results. False-positive screenings can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, such as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, causing patients undue physical, economic, and emotional harm. For example, such procedures can result in infertility and induced menopause in premenopausal women. Therefore, given that these tests are the most common means of identifying ovarian cancer, it is essential to explore the potential risks of their use as screening tools.

When considering these tests and others as screening tools, stratifying populations between high-risk and average-risk patient populations remains crucial.

The recommendations were developed by a multinational, multidisciplinary group of experts using evidence from existing guidelines and clinical experience as a guide. The ASCO Expert Panel underscores that health care practitioners who implement the recommendations presented in this guideline should first identify the available resources in their local and referral facilities and endeavor to provide the highest level of care possible with those resources. The authors would like to make some general points applying to recommendations throughout this guideline: outcomes should be balanced with quality of life, including financial toxicity; recommendations are made regarding what is feasible in resource-constrained settings.

Because of the large breadth of recommendations, the panel elected to discuss selected areas.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^111e1WBz]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is relatively rare but is the fifth-leading cause of cancer mortality among women in the United States.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of ovarian cancer screening among average-risk women to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

- **Data sources**: The sources included MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials; studies published in English from January 1, 2003, through January 31, 2017; and ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through November 22, 2017.

- **Study selection**: The review focused on randomized clinical trials of ovarian cancer screening in average-risk women that reported mortality or quality-of-life outcomes. Interventions included transvaginal ultrasound, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) testing, or their combination. Comparators were usual care or no screening.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction were conducted by two reviewers. Meta-analytic pooling of results was not conducted because of the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of interventions.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcomes measured included ovarian cancer mortality, false-positive screening results and surgery, surgical complications, and psychological effects of screening.

- **Results**: Four trials (N = 293,587) were included; of these, three (n = 293,038) assessed ovarian cancer mortality, and one (n = 549) reported only on psychological outcomes. Evaluated screening interventions included transvaginal ultrasound alone, transvaginal ultrasound plus CA-125 testing, and CA-125 testing alone. Test positivity for CA-125 was defined by a fixed serum level.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^112X6DEo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

Appendix 6 summarizes studies and society guidelines for patients with an incidental finding of an ovarian cyst on imaging using various methods, including transvaginal ultrasonography, biomarkers, biomarker assays, and multimodal risk assessment, to exclude ovarian cancer. The studies had a number of limitations, including being conducted in patients who underwent surgery, limiting understanding of how the strategies perform in expectantly managed patients. The study populations also frequently had a higher ovarian cancer incidence than expected, which may overestimate diagnostic accuracy. CA 125 is the most frequently measured serum marker for the evaluation and early diagnosis of ovarian cancer despite variation in its measured sensitivity (61–90%) and specificity (71–93%). Sensitivity and specificity are poorer in premenopausal patients than postmenopausal patients, likely because benign conditions that can cause CA 125 elevation occur more frequently in premenopausal patients than postmenopausal patients, and the ovarian cancer incidence is lower in premenopausal patients than in postmenopausal patients. The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Phase 5 study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study with patients selected for surgery or conservative management based on morphology and symptoms. In this study, 1,919 patients with a new diagnosis of a mass assessed as benign on ultrasonography had outcomes examined at 24 months after enrollment. Of these, 20.2% had spontaneous resolution of their mass during follow-up, and 16.1% had surgical intervention.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^113nRzGA]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The complete checklist is included in the online supplemental appendix.

- **Search strategy**: Eligible studies were initially identified by searching PubMed and Embase in March 2023. To increase the rigor of this study, searches were conducted again in March 2024 using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL. We also reviewed grey literature using Scopus and searched for the last five years of conference proceedings from the Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Annual Meeting. The complete search strategy can be found in online supplemental appendix A.

- **Selection criteria**: All observational studies, retrospective studies, and randomized/non-randomized trials published between 2003 and 2023 reporting unnecessary surgical interventions secondary to a false-positive screening were included. Studies published prior to 2003 or not written in English were excluded.

- **Study selection and data collection process**: The studies for this review were selected using Covidence software (Figure 1). Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, blinded to each other's decisions. A study was included if both reviewers independently determined fulfillment of inclusion criteria. Disputes were discussed among reviewers and, if necessary, resolved by a third reviewer. The same process was followed for full-text review and data extraction.

### Screening for ovarian cancer by transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 measurement in women with a familial predisposition: A prospective cohort study [^114HbvsR]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in combination with CA125 to detect ovarian cancer in women at hereditary risk for ovarian cancer. A semi-annual surveillance protocol comprising CA125 measurement and TVUS was offered to 676 women, including 85 BRCA mutation carriers. Surgical intervention was performed if TVUS revealed a suspicious cyst or if elevated CA125 levels or cystic lesions persisted in two consecutive examinations.

Histological verification was conducted on ten women, revealing one case of serous cystadenocarcinoma at stage Ic. No interval ovarian cancer occurred. The specificity of surgical intervention reached 98.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 97.5% to 99.3%) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 10% (95% CI: 1.8% to 40.4%).

The low PPV is attributed to the unexpectedly low incidence of ovarian cancer. Large-scale investigations, including details on potential confounders and modifiers, are needed to further evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening for women at high risk.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^115jvPgX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Our review did not find any high-quality evidence supporting the use of other serum markers, circulating tumor cells, or algorithms in ovarian cancer screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome, concluding that "there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits".

- **Screening in patients at high risk**: We found no randomized controlled trials of ovarian cancer screening in women at high risk. Secondary analysis of the PLCO cancer screening trial data revealed similar rates of abnormal ovarian cancer screening with ultrasonography and CA 125 evaluation across all risk groups, and no difference in overall or disease-specific mortality. The University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which used screening ultrasonography and CA 125 assessment, reported increased 5- and 10-year survival rates for patients with screening-detected epithelial ovarian cancer compared with unscreened patients with epithelial ovarian cancer; however, this study was not randomized, lacked a control group, and did not describe patients' cancer histology.

Because of the lack of efficacy of ovarian cancer screening in patients at high risk, none of the professional societies included in this review explicitly recommend ovarian cancer screening for this population; however, several state that ovarian cancer screening can be offered to patients at high risk.

### Reducing ovarian cancer mortality through screening: Is it possible, and can we afford it [^112kzicP]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Given the low prevalence of this disease, the effectiveness of screening strategies has not been established. We wished to estimate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of potential screening strategies for ovarian cancer using population-specific data.

- **Methods**: A Markov state transition model was used to simulate the natural history of ovarian cancer in a cohort of women aged 20 to 100. Age-specific incidence and mortality rates were obtained from SEER. Base-case characteristics of a potential screening test included sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 95%, and a cost of $50. Outcome measures were mortality reduction, lifetime number of false positive screening tests, positive predictive value, years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs in US dollars, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, in cost/YLS).

- **Results**: The model-predicted lifetime risk of ovarian cancer was 1.38%, the lifetime risk of death from ovarian cancer was 0.95%, and the stage distribution was approximately stage I-19%, stage II-7%, and stage III, IV, or unstaged - 74%, closely approximating SEER data. Annual screening resulted in a 43% reduction in ovarian cancer mortality, with an ICER of $73,469/YLS in the base case and $36,025/YLS in high-risk populations compared to no screening. In the base case, the average lifetime number of false positive tests was 1.06. Cost-effectiveness of screening was most sensitive to test frequency, specificity, and cost.

- **Conclusions**: Annual screening for ovarian cancer has the potential to be cost-effective, particularly in high-risk populations.

### Screening for familial ovarian cancer: Failure of current protocols to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics system [^115rF2JQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the effectiveness of annual ovarian cancer screening (transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 estimation) in detecting presymptomatic ovarian cancer in women at increased genetic risk, a cohort of 1,110 women at increased risk of ovarian cancer was screened between January 1991 and March 2004. Among these, 553 were moderate-risk individuals (4% to 10% lifetime risk), and 557 were high-risk individuals (> 10% lifetime risk). Outcome measurements included the number and stage of screen-detected cancers, the number and stage of cancers not detected at screening, the number of equivocal screening results requiring recall/repetition, and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease.

Thirteen epithelial ovarian malignancies (12 invasive and one borderline) developed in the cohort. Ten tumors were detected at screening: three International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I (including borderline), two stage II, four stage III, and one stage IV. Of the three cancers not detected by screening, two were stage III and one was stage IV. Additionally, 29 women underwent diagnostic surgery but were found not to have ovarian cancer.

In conclusion, annual surveillance by transvaginal ultrasound scanning and serum CA-125 measurement in women at increased familial risk of ovarian cancer is ineffective in detecting tumors at a sufficiently early stage to influence prognosis. With a positive predictive value of 17% and a sensitivity of less than 50%, the performance of ultrasound does not satisfy the WHO screening standards.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^113ocofd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

- **Screening methods that have been proposed**: The most common methods studied for ovarian cancer screening are transvaginal ultrasonography, bimanual palpation, and measurement of the serum tumor marker CA 125. Algorithms using a combination of transvaginal ultrasonography and tumor markers have also been studied. These algorithms include the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) and the parametric empirical Bayes model. ROCA estimates the risk of ovarian cancer on the basis of age and change in CA 125. The algorithm makes recommendations for repeat assessment of CA 125 or transvaginal ultrasonography on the basis of the calculated risk.

	- ROCA was initially studied in a randomized controlled trial of 13,582 women aged 50 years and older; it had a specificity for epithelial ovarian cancer of 99.8% (95% CI 99.7–99.9%) and a positive predictive value of 19% (95% CI 4.1–45.6%). ROCA was further studied in the prospective United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study and in a large-scale, randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom. The parametric empirical Bayes model also interprets serial CA 125 levels and has performed similarly to ROCA in an examination of U.K. data sets.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^116JZwDe]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

ASCO's adaptation process begins with a literature search by ASCO guidelines staff to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation. Adapted guideline manuscripts are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC). The review includes two parts: methodologic review and content review. The methodologic review is completed by a member of the CPGC's Methodology Subcommittee and/or by ASCO guidelines staff. The content review is completed by an Expert Panel. All funding for the administration of the project was provided by ASCO. Further details of the methods used for the development of this guideline are reported in the ASCO Guidelines Methodology Manual.

This guideline was partially informed by ASCO's modified Delphi Formal Expert Consensus methodology. During this process, the Expert Panel was supplemented by additional experts recruited to rate their agreement with the drafted recommendations. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. In round 1, 20 experts (plus two who were on the Expert Panel) participated; in round 2, there were a total of 26 respondents (nine of whom were on the Expert Panel). The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support methodology. The guideline recommendations were sent for an open comment period of two weeks, allowing the public to review and comment on the recommendations after submitting a confidentiality agreement. These comments were taken into consideration.

### Time to de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices: A narrative review [^112m7Gkh]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic women

The 1996 ovarian cancer screening Grade D guideline cited studies published in 1990, 1991, and 1993, showing no benefit of pelvic screening, serum tumor testing, and transvaginal ultrasound screening methods. Subsequent USPSTF guidelines cited two large RCTs published in 2011 and 2016 to support the continuation of the Grade D rating. Two national surveys measured physician-reported ovarian cancer screening practices after the guideline publication. A 2012 survey of women's primary care physicians (n = 1088, response rate 61.7%) found that 28% of respondents reported performing inappropriate screening. Similarly, a 2016 survey of gynecologists (n = 401, response rate 67.1%) found that 58% of respondents reported regularly recommending inappropriate screening. Given the lack of evidence on pre-guideline practice trends, our characterization of the time to de-implementation is limited to the three years between the publication of evidence demonstrating the lack of benefit of screening (1993) and the release of the USPSTF guidelines (1996).

Thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults

The Grade D recommendation for thyroid cancer screening was issued in 1996 and cited studies published as late as 1992. The recommendation statement described a lack of evidence for screening benefits and poor accuracy of available screening methods. The 2017 guideline evidence review also found insufficient evidence to support screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults or children. A meta-analysis of seven single-center observational studies published…

### Results from four rounds of ovarian cancer screening in a randomized trial [^116MdpqP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to test whether annual screening with transvaginal ultrasonography and CA 125 reduces ovarian cancer mortality.

- **Methods**: Data from the first four annual screens, denoted T0-T3, are reported. A CA 125 value at or above 35 units/mL or an abnormality on transvaginal ultrasonography was considered a positive screen. Diagnostic follow-up of positive screens was performed at the discretion of participants' physicians. Diagnostic procedures and cancers were tracked and verified through medical records.

- **Results**: Among 34,261 women in the screening arm without prior oophorectomy, compliance with screening ranged from 83.1% (T0) to 77.6% (T3). Screen positivity rates with transvaginal ultrasonography declined slightly, from 4.6 at T0 to 2.9–3.4 at T1-T3; CA 125 positivity rates (range 1.4–1.8%) showed no time trend. Eighty-nine invasive ovarian or peritoneal cancers were diagnosed; 60 were screen-detected. The positive predictive value (PPV) and cancer yield per 10,000 women screened on the combination of tests were similar across screening rounds (range 1.0–1.3% for PPV and 4.7–6.2 for yield); however, the biopsy (surgery) rate among screen positives decreased from 34% at T0 to 15–20% at T1-T3. The overall ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers was 19.5:1. Seventy-two percent of screen-detected cases were late stage (III/IV).

- **Conclusion**: Through four screening rounds, the ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers was high, and most cases were late stage. However, the effect of screening on mortality is as yet unknown.

### Ovarian cancer population screening and mortality after long-term follow-up in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^111UR7gt]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer continues to have a poor prognosis, as the majority of women are diagnosed with advanced disease. Therefore, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) was conducted to determine if population screening can reduce deaths due to the disease. This report focuses on ovarian cancer mortality after long-term follow-up in UKCTOCS.

- **Methods**: In this randomised controlled trial, postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years were recruited from 13 centers in National Health Service trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were bilateral oophorectomy, previous ovarian or active non-ovarian malignancy, or increased familial ovarian cancer risk. Eligibility was confirmed by the trial management system, and participants were randomly allocated in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS), annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. Follow-up was conducted through national registries. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian or tubal cancer (WHO 2014 criteria) by June 30, 2020. Analyses were by intention to screen, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening using the versatile test. Investigators and participants were aware of the screening type, but the outcomes review committee was masked to the randomisation group.

- **Findings**: Between April 17, 2001, and Sept 29, 2005, out of 1,243,282 women invited, 202,638 were recruited and randomly assigned, and 202,562 were included in the analysis.
