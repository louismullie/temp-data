## Question

What is the left ventricular ejection fraction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is, covering its definition, calculation, measurement methods, normal ranges, heart failure classification thresholds, prognostic meaning, key limitations, and how current practice is moving beyond absolute EF cutoffs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic and mathematical definition of LVEF. Then, I should verify how it is measured in practice and how reproducible those methods are. Next, I need to check normal reference ranges and clinical cut points used to phenotype heart failure. After that, I will examine prognostic patterns across the EF spectrum. Finally, I should review limitations and evolving concepts such as EF trajectories and myocardial strain, making sure each step aligns with consensus and high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental definition so I don't gloss over basics. LVEF is a measure of left ventricular systolic function expressed as a percentage of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat; mathematically, it is calculated as stroke volume divided by end-diastolic volume, reflecting the efficiency of systolic ejection rather than an intrinsic load-independent contractility index, which I should not conflate here.

> Next, I should review how we actually measure LVEF and how reliable those measurements are. Echocardiography is the most widely used modality because it is versatile, available, and indispensable in heart failure care, but I need to remember that measurement variability is nontrivial in routine practice with reported intraobserver variability around 18–21% and interobserver variability around 6–13%, which can misclassify patients, especially near thresholds that drive treatment decisions [^113GfdMM] [^117XcFJt]. Hold on, I should also verify alternatives: 3-dimensional echocardiography improves agreement for EF versus 2D echo when compared to cardiac MRI, and count-based radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA) and CMR are valid methods used in trials and practice, with no evidence that the imaging modality used to estimate LVEF modifies ICD benefit when EF is ≤ 35% [^116Pfyom] [^113CgEo5].

> I need to ensure I state normal reference ranges correctly. Wait, I almost defaulted to a generic "50–70%" range, but contemporary echo recommendations emphasize sex-specific lower limits of normal: approximately 52% for men and 54% for women, with normal ranges extending up to about 74% for both sexes; measurement context and method matter, and even the Entresto label reminds us that LVEF is variable and requires clinical judgment in interpretation and treatment selection [^117XcFJt] [^111yQPFP]. Let me double-check that I haven't overgeneralized across imaging modalities; these ranges derive from echocardiography and may not translate identically to CMR or nuclear techniques, reinforcing the need to interpret EF within modality-specific norms [^117XcFJt].

> Now, I should confirm the clinical cutoffs that define heart failure phenotypes because these thresholds guide trials and therapy access. Heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) is traditionally defined as LVEF ≤ 40%, heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) as 41–49%, and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) as ≥ 50%, with some variation in trial enrollment criteria historically; these categories remain embedded in contemporary guidance and research [^113LprWF] [^111Yt2gv] [^113w7kCy]. I need to check treatment-linked thresholds too: primary prevention ICD candidacy typically considers LVEF ≤ 35% with appropriate clinical context, and drug labels like candesartan specify benefit in HF with EF ≤ 40%, while sacubitril/valsartan shows the clearest benefits when LVEF is "below normal", underscoring the practical impact of these boundaries on care pathways [^115jF7Rw] [^11144UAM] [^111yQPFP].

> I will now examine prognosis across the EF spectrum to avoid oversimplifying "higher is better". An EF < 40% is associated with the highest 5‑year mortality in population-level echocardiography cohorts, with risk decreasing toward a nadir around 65–70%, but importantly, supranormal EF (> 70%) appears paradoxically associated with higher events, a pattern reproduced in CMR cohorts and especially relevant in women and younger patients; I should confirm these effects are context and etiology dependent [^1149pPu5] [^112Uf1Bv]. Hold on, I should verify heterogeneity by cause of HF: in ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, mortality risk tends to decline continuously with rising EF, whereas in hypertensive or valvular etiologies the association may be weaker or absent, highlighting that EF's prognostic meaning is not uniform across causes [^116vMEuJ].

> Let me consider critical limitations and caveats so we don't over-interpret a single number. LVEF is load-dependent, geometry-dependent, and only moderately reproducible, so it can change with afterload or preload shifts and with remodeling patterns; its prognostic and diagnostic value diminishes once it is above roughly 45%, and it may miss early or subtle systolic dysfunction especially within preserved EF ranges, which demands caution near therapeutic thresholds [^115enepZ] [^113LprWF]. I should double-check the geometry point: LV fiber architecture and chamber shape can preserve EF in the face of dysfunction, whereas spherical remodeling can reduce EF independent of pure contractile changes, illustrating why EF alone can be misleading in specific pathophysiologic contexts [^1153RyGb].

> Next, I should review how practice is evolving beyond absolute EF cutoffs. There is growing emphasis on EF trajectories over time, because improvement from ≤ 40% to higher categories aligns with reverse remodeling and better outcomes, whereas deterioration from > 40% into ≤ 40% portends worse prognosis; GLS adds incremental risk stratification in mildly reduced or preserved EF, and an integrated echo assessment beyond EF is increasingly recommended to better phenotype HF [^117XyfUQ] [^111UxnZy] [^113QN7s8]. But wait, what if therapy selection hinges on EF? Recent consensus notes that some foundational therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs in selected scenarios, need not be delayed by waiting for EF categorization, and SGLT2 inhibitor benefits extend across the EF spectrum including > 40%, which supports moving toward phenotype- and trajectory-based decisions rather than rigid EF bins alone [^113LprWF] [^113w7kCy] [^114MTTEn].

> Finally, I need to ensure we account for technique and context so the EF we act on is as accurate as possible. When image quality is limited, the use of contrast and harmonic imaging can markedly improve endocardial definition and correlation with reference standards, and 3D echocardiography provides smaller volume bias and variance versus 2D echo when compared to CMR; body habitus and acoustic windows can substantially affect 2D quantitation and favor 3D or CMR when feasible [^114nWJuR] [^116Pfyom] [^117GHu69]. Hold on, I should verify the practical implication: given real-world variability, repeating measurements, standardizing methods, and corroborating with complementary parameters like GLS and left atrial or diastolic indices can reduce misclassification and improve clinical decision-making, especially near critical thresholds that trigger device or pharmacologic therapies [^117XcFJt] [^113QN7s8].

LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) is the **percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat**, calculated as (stroke volume/end-diastolic volume) × 100. It is a **key measure of systolic function** and is used to classify heart failure, guide therapy, and assess prognosis [^113LprWF]. Normal LVEF is typically **52–74% in men and 54–74% in women** [^117XcFJt]; reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) indicates systolic dysfunction and higher risk [^11144UAM], while preserved LVEF (≥ 50%) can still be associated with heart failure symptoms [^1149pPu5]. LVEF is most commonly measured by echocardiography [^113GfdMM], but is load-dependent [^115enepZ] and may not detect subtle dysfunction [^113QN7s8], so additional measures like global longitudinal strain are often used [^112eDBuV].

---

## Definition and calculation

LVEF is the fraction of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole relative to its total volume at end-diastole, calculated as **LVEF = (stroke volume / end-diastolic volume) × 100** [^115enepZ]. Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped with each heartbeat, whereas end-diastolic volume is the total blood volume in the ventricle at the end of diastole (ventricular filling) [^112eDBuV].

---

## Normal ranges and clinical significance

Normal LVEF values vary slightly by sex, with typical ranges of **52%–74% in men and 54%–74% in women** [^117XcFJt]. LVEF is a critical parameter for diagnosing and managing heart failure and is used to classify HF into:

- **HFrEF (≤ 40%)**: Indicates systolic dysfunction and higher risk of adverse outcomes [^11144UAM].
- **HFmrEF (41%–49%)**: Carries intermediate risk and for which therapeutic strategies are evolving [^111Yt2gv].
- **HFpEF (≥ 50%)**: Characterized by diastolic dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality [^1149pPu5].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with abnormal LVEF

Several conditions are associated with abnormal LVEF. Reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) is commonly seen in **systolic heart failure** [^1149pPu5], myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathies, and valvular heart diseases, whereas **preserved LVEF (≥ 50%)** is associated with diastolic heart failure, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and aging populations [^1175zZR5].

---

## Measurement techniques

LVEF is measured using **various imaging modalities**:

- **Echocardiography**: Most commonly used, non-invasive, and widely available [^113GfdMM]. However, it is load-dependent and may not detect subtle dysfunction [^112eDBuV].
- **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Considered the gold standard for accuracy and reproducibility [^116Pfyom].
- **Nuclear imaging (MUGA scan)**: Provides accurate measurements [^114nWJuR] but involves radiation exposure.

---

## Limitations and considerations

While LVEF is valuable, it **has limitations**, including:

- **Load dependence**: LVEF is influenced by preload and afterload conditions [^112eDBuV], potentially masking subtle myocardial dysfunction [^115enepZ].
- **Variability**: Significant intra- and inter-observer variability exists, particularly with echocardiography [^117XcFJt] [^113w7kCy].
- **Limited sensitivity**: LVEF may not detect early or subtle myocardial dysfunction, necessitating additional measures such as global longitudinal strain (GLS) [^112eDBuV] [^113QN7s8].

---

## Clinical implications of changes in LVEF

Changes in LVEF over time have important prognostic value [^111UxnZy]. Improvement in LVEF is associated with **better clinical outcomes**, reduced mortality, and improved quality of life [^116wbNdK], whereas a decline indicates worsening cardiac function with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization and higher mortality [^113xwLrM].

---

## Therapeutic interventions targeting LVEF

Pharmacological therapies — including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), and sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — **improve LVEF and clinical outcomes**. Device therapies such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) [^113CgEo5] and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are indicated for patients with significantly reduced LVEF to prevent sudden cardiac death and improve cardiac function [^115jF7Rw].

---

## Prognostic value of LVEF

Reduced LVEF is associated with **higher mortality** [^1149pPu5], increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, and adverse cardiovascular events [^112Uf1Bv]. Although traditionally considered lower risk, HFpEF with preserved LVEF still carries significant morbidity and mortality [^113QN7s8].

---

LVEF is a fundamental measure of cardiac function, reflecting the percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole. It is essential for diagnosing, managing, and prognosticating heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions. Despite its limitations, **LVEF remains a cornerstone in clinical cardiology**, guiding therapeutic decisions and monitoring disease progression [^113LprWF].

### The role of echocardiography in heart failure [^113GfdMM]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Data from echocardiography provide a cornerstone in the management of heart failure. All imaging techniques can provide an ejection fraction, but the versatility of echocardiography makes it unique in the provision of volumes, diastolic function, right ventricular function, hemodynamics, and valvular regurgitation. The early detection of heart failure has been facilitated by the assessment of global longitudinal strain, which is also useful in later heart failure for the assessment of left ventricular synchrony. The use of echocardiography has been associated with favorable outcomes, probably on the basis of facilitation of appropriate therapy. This review examines the evidence provided by echocardiography and its application in specific settings. Although the guidelines emphasize that no single test satisfies all imaging requirements in heart failure, and other modalities can provide additional information about specific questions (especially tissue characterization), echocardiography is indispensable in the management of heart failure.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^117XcFJt]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Population-specific LVEF cut-offs**: Several studies have reported on the bimodal distribution of LVEF among patients with incident HF. Contemporary American and European echocardiography guidelines recognize that the normal LVEF range is shifted to 54%–74% in women vs. 52%–74% in men. Recent evidence from pooled analyses of 13,195 patients with HF enrolled in the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF across the LVEF spectrum showed that the therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan varied by EF and sex (p interaction = 0.02). As supported by a large cohort study of sex-specific thresholds of mortality, the beneficial effects of neurohormonal blockade could potentially extend to patients with HFmrEF and possibly to an even higher range of LVEF in women. The EchoNoRMAL study has also derived age-, sex-, and ethnic-appropriate adult reference values in population studies. Therefore, sex- and ethnicity-specific LVEF cut-offs in future revisions of the consensus document will provide the necessary biological premise, which is currently lacking.

- **Variability in LVEF measurement**: The clinical and epidemiological utility of LVEF is well-established, but the accuracy of LVEF measurement in clinical practice is debatable. Echocardiography, the most widely used imaging modality of LVEF, incurs an 18%-21% intraobserver and 6%-13% interobserver variability. The inherent digit rounding bias, visual underestimation of true LVEF values, poor image quality, and measurement error collectively contribute to the misclassification of patients. In the TOPCAT trial, core laboratory overreads reclassified many patients.

### Ejection fraction and mortality: a nationwide register-based cohort study of 499 153 women and men [^1149pPu5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated the sex-based risk of mortality across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a large cohort of patients in Australia.

- **Methods and results**: Quantified levels of LVEF from 237,046 women (48.1%) and 256,109 men undergoing first-time, routine echocardiography (2000–2019) were linked to 119,232 deaths (median 5.6 years of follow-up). Overall, 17.6% of men versus 8.3% of women had an LVEF < 50%. An LVEF < 40% was associated with the highest crude cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality at 5 years (∼20–30% and ∼40–50%, respectively). Thereafter, actual cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality at 5 years in both sexes steeply improved to a nadir LVEF of 65.0–69.9% (reference group). Below this LVEF level, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular-related mortality for an LVEF of 55.0–59.9% was 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.59; P < 0.001] in women and 1.21 (95% CI 1.05–1.39; P = 0.008) in men. In women, an LVEF of 60.0–64.9% was also associated with an HR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.16–1.52; P < 0.001) for cardiovascular-related mortality. These associations were most striking in women and men aged < 65 years and were replicated in those with suspected heart failure (32,403 cases aged 65.2 ± 16.1 years, 57.0% women). For pre-existing heart failure (33,738 cases aged 67.6 ± 16.9 years, 46.5% women), the specific threshold of increased mortality was at and below 50.0–54.9%.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients investigated for suspected or established cardiovascular disease, we found clinically relevant sex-based differences in the distribution and mortality risk associated with LVEF.

### Assessing left ventricular systolic function: From ejection fraction to strain analysis [^112eDBuV]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a ubiquitous component of imaging studies used to evaluate patients with cardiac conditions and acts as an arbiter for many management decisions. Early trials investigated heart failure therapies using a binary LVEF cut-off to select patients with the worst prognosis, who may gain the most benefit. Forty years on, the cardiac disease landscape has changed. Left ventricular ejection fraction is now a poor indicator of prognosis for many heart failure patients, specifically for the half of patients with heart failure and truly preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF). It is also recognized that LVEF may remain normal among patients with valvular heart disease who have significant myocardial dysfunction.

This emphasizes the importance of the interaction between LVEF and left ventricular geometry. Guidelines based on LVEF may therefore miss a proportion of patients who would benefit from early intervention to prevent further myocardial decompensation and future adverse outcomes. The assessment of myocardial strain, or intrinsic deformation, holds promise to improve these issues. The measurement of global longitudinal strain (GLS) has consistently been shown to improve the risk stratification of patients with heart failure and identify patients with valvular heart disease who have myocardial decompensation despite preserved LVEF and an increased risk of adverse outcomes. To complete the integration of GLS into routine clinical practice, further studies are required to confirm that such approaches are effective.

Atacand is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations. Atacand also has an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor.

### Retraining an artificial intelligence algorithm to calculate left ventricular ejection fraction in pediatrics [^114LXyEZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and monitoring LVEF responses to treatment are important clinical goals. Can a deep-learning algorithm predict pediatric LVEF within clinically acceptable error?

- **Design**: The study authors aimed to fine-tune an adult deep-learning algorithm to calculate LVEF in pediatric patients. A priori, their objective was to refine the algorithm to perform LVEF calculation with a mean absolute error (MAE) ≤ 5%.

- **Setting**: A quaternary pediatric hospital.

- **Participants**: A convenience sample (n = 321) of echocardiograms from newborns to 18 years old with normal cardiac anatomy or hemodynamically insignificant anomalies. Echocardiograms were chosen from a group of healthy controls with known normal LVEF (n = 267) and a dilated cardiomyopathy patient group with reduced LVEF (n = 54).

- **Interventions**: The artificial intelligence model EchoNet-Dynamic was tested on this dataset and then retrained, tested, and further validated to improve LVEF calculation. The gold standard value was LVEF calculated by clinical experts.

- **Measurements and Main Results**: In a random subset of subjects (n = 40) not analyzed prior to selection of the final model, EchoNet-Dynamic calculated LVEF with a MAE of 8.39%, R² = 0.47 without fine-tuning, and MAE 4.47%, R² = 0.87 with fine-tuning. Bland-Altman analysis suggested that the model slightly underestimates LVEF (bias = -2.42%). The 95% limits of agreement between actual and calculated values were -12.32% to 7.47%.

- **Conclusions**: The fine-tuned model calculates LVEF in a range of pediatric patients.

### A novel mechanism of heart failure with normal ejection fraction [^111GiMGm]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with heart failure and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction have significantly reduced left ventricular long-axis function. This paper proposes an explanation for this apparent paradox and suggests a new mechanism of "diastolic" heart failure.

- **Method**: The effect of changes in left ventricular hypertrophy on stroke volume and ejection fraction in non-dilated left ventricles was calculated using the area-length method. Further, the effect of a reduction in long-axis shortening on these parameters was determined.

- **Results**: Increasing left ventricular hypertrophy resulted in augmentation of systolic wall thickening and ejection fraction but not stroke volume when long-axis shortening was normal. In the presence of abnormal long-axis function, stroke volume was reduced but ejection fraction was preserved.

- **Conclusion**: The model predicts that the normal ejection fraction in patients with heart failure may be explained by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The resulting amplified radial thickening in the setting of reduced long-axis shortening explains the preservation of ejection fraction. The reduced stroke volume in the precompensated state, rather than diastolic dysfunction, may be the cause of heart failure.

### In-hospital course of patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction in the DELIVER trial [^114fSkRr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Low credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction changes during study follow-up: Of the total 747 patients enrolled in DELIVER who experienced at least one HF hospitalization, 66% had LVEF data available during a hospitalization. Those with LVEF data available were more likely to have a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, lower LVEF and systolic blood pressure at baseline, and were more often treated with multi-drug guideline-directed medical therapy (online supplementary Table Appendix S1). Among the 144 patients with HFimpEF who experienced at least one HF hospitalization, 65 (45%) had at least one LVEF measurement available during one of the HF hospitalization events. Of those, 43 (67%) experienced a reduction in their LVEF to ≤ 40% during an HF hospitalization. In contrast, among the 603 participants with LVEF consistently > 40% who had at least one HF hospitalization, 428 (71%) had available LVEF data. Of those, 125 (29%) experienced a reduction in their LVEF to ≤ 40% during an HF hospitalization.

The mean change during an HF hospitalization from LVEF at enrolment was −11 ± 11 in participants with HFimpEF and − 7 ± 11 in participants with HF and consistently higher LVEF.

### Trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction after acute decompensation for systolic heart failure: Concomitant echocardiographic and systemic changes, predictors, and impact on clinical outcomes [^117XyfUQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Prospective longitudinal follow-up of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) trajectories after acute cardiac decompensation of heart failure is lacking. We investigated changes in LVEF and covariates at 6-month follow-up in patients with a predischarge LVEF ≤ 40% and determined predictors and prognostic implications of LVEF changes through 18-month follow-up.

- **Methods and results**: Interdisciplinary Network Heart Failure program participants (n = 633) were categorized into subgroups based on LVEF at 6-month follow-up: normalized LVEF (> 50%; heart failure with normalized ejection fraction, n = 147), midrange LVEF (41%-50%; heart failure with midrange ejection fraction, n = 195), or persistently reduced LVEF (≤ 40%; heart failure with persistently reduced LVEF, n = 291). All received guideline-directed medical therapies.

- **Comparative outcomes**: At 6 months, compared with patients with heart failure with persistently reduced LVEF, those with normalized or midrange LVEF showed greater reductions in LV end-diastolic/end-systolic diameters (both P < 0.001) and left atrial systolic diameter (P = 0.002), more increased septal/posterior end-diastolic wall thickness (both P < 0.001), and significantly greater improvement in diastolic function, biomarkers, symptoms, and health status.

- **Independent predictors**: Heart failure duration < 1 year, female sex, higher predischarge blood pressure, and baseline LVEF were independent predictors of LVEF improvement.

- **Survival outcomes**: Mortality and event-free survival rates were lower in patients with heart failure with normalized LVEF (P = 0.002).

### Ejection fraction indexed to left ventricular mass and its association with cardiac event risk in a community population with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^116CafmD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Two‐dimensional echocardiographic findings are detailed as follows. Participants who experienced incidents presented higher left ventricular septal thickness in diastole (LVSTd) (9.80 ± 1.69 mm versus 9.44 ± 1.43 mm; P = 0.025), left ventricular end‐systolic volume (median: 37.92 mL [IQR, 32.21–47.44 mL] versus 35.00 mL [IQR, 29.55–40.96 mL]; P = 0.002), left ventricular mass (LVM) (156.39 ± 45.23 g versus 146.00 ± 35.85 g; P = 0.017), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (90.04 ± 25.17 g/m² versus 86.11 ± 19.86 g/m²; P = 0.041) compared to those without incidents.

- **Left ventricular systolic function**:
	- Participants with cardiac events had significantly lower fractional shortening (33.43% ± 5.24% versus 35.07 ± 5.11%; P = 0.001), LVEF/LVM ratio (4.33 ± 1.36 versus 4.60 ± 1.21 /kg; P = 0.039), LVEF/LVM/BSA (2.57 ± 1.00 versus 2.76 ± 0.87 m²/kg²; P = 0.024), and LVEF/LVM/BMI (17.38 ± 6.65 versus 18.66 ± 6.35 m²/kg; P = 0.038). However, there were no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (62.38 ± 6.49% versus 63.27 ± 5.15%; P = 0.146), LVEF/(LVM/BSA) (7.44 ± 2.08 versus 7.74 ± 1.90 m²/kg; P = 0.096), LVEF/(LVM/BMI) (111.81 ± 36.45 versus 115.90 ± 30.98/m²; P = 0.25), stroke volume (median: 61.95 mL [IQR, 53.97–69.22 mL] versus median: 62.89 mL [IQR, 54.06–75.29 mL]; P = 0.368), cardiac output (4.98 ± 1.46 versus 4.93 ± 1.23 L/min; P = 0.632), or cardiac index (2.86 ± 0.78 versus 2.91 ± 0.69 L/min per m²; P = 0.532).

### Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction [^112WhFC6]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Nearly half of patients with symptoms of heart failure are found to have a normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. This has variously been labeled as diastolic heart failure, heart failure with preserved LV function, or heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). Recent studies have shown that systolic function is not entirely normal in these patients, hence HFNEF is the preferred term. The epidemiology, aetiology, and possible pathophysiology of this contentious condition are reviewed. The importance of the remodeling process in determining whether a patient presents with systolic heart failure or HFNEF is emphasized, and this can be used to classify patients in a more rational manner.

### Trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction after acute decompensation for systolic heart failure: Concomitant echocardiographic and systemic changes, predictors, and impact on clinical outcomes [^114JxmzU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

During prospective follow-up, significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurred within 6 months in the majority of patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) at the time of discharge after acute cardiac decompensation (ACD). Many patients transitioned between LVEF categories as proposed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, and nearly one-quarter experienced normalization of LVEF.

Close associations between changes in LVEF and those in other metrics of cardiac and systemic reverse remodeling reveal that LVEF is a useful surrogate marker of remodeling and its reversal, with improvements predicting better long-term clinical outcomes. Conversely, the longer-term LVEF trajectory showed that clinical worsening, as tracked by the rehospitalization requirement, may reverse or attenuate previous reverse remodeling.

Close associations between improvements in LVEF and both heart failure (HF) duration and cause of ischemia identify these variables as major predictors of the myocardial capacity for repair. It is important to appreciate that patients with HFrEF who experience normalization of their LVEF to greater than 50% are pathophysiologically and clinically distinct from those who primarily had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and also have an LVEF greater than 50% after recovery from ACD.

The HF trajectory after ACD seems a suitable model for further prospective research to better understand remodeling and its reversal at a mechanistic and molecular level. Our findings call for consideration of individual LVEF trajectories in HF phenotyping and highlight the need for improved, personalized patient risk stratification and tailored care approaches.

### Comparison of visual estimation and quantitative measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction in untrained perioperative echocardiographers [^116AZzt5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

The visual method of estimating LVEF has been closely correlated with other methods of assessing LVEF. Most studies have correlated LVEF between visual estimation and quantifying methods in experienced echocardiographers. Shahgaldi et al. reported an R of 0.91 for 2D and 0.95 for triplane echocardiography estimated by experienced echocardiographers and quantitative real-time three-dimensional echocardiography.

However, Unluer et al. studied this estimation technique in novice emergency physicians following a brief training program and demonstrated a strong correlation with the LVEF measured by cardiologists. We showed that the LVEF estimated by untrained echocardiographers is highly correlated (r = 0.818) with the LVEF measured by experts. This may be due to the immediate feedback participants received during the review process in this study. Akinboboye et al. proposed that an acceptable learning curve of visual estimation of LVEF occurred after 20 cases had been reviewed with instant feedback. In comparison, Lee et al. reported a minimum of 55 case reviews with feedback to effectively train LVEF visual estimation in medical students. This study used 35 cases with instant feedback because our objective was to evaluate the ability to estimate the LVEF rather than to conduct training.

The ease of the visual LVEF estimation learning process suggests that it could be helpful in training novice echocardiographers to interpret LV function in emergency situations. One of the most important parameters needed to manage hemodynamic problems is the systolic function of the LV.

### Predictors and outcomes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction above or below 60 [^114hjqbz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Among the 812 patients, 204 patients — 79 (25%) in the LVEF 50–60 group and 125 (25%) in the LVEF 60- group — reached the clinical outcome of cardiac mortality or heart failure rehospitalization with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 366 days (93–720 days). Survival curve analysis showed that the prognosis of the LVEF 60- group did not differ from that of the LVEF 50–60 group (log-rank P = 0.7970).

- **Kaplan-Meier curves**: These depict patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) whose LVEF was below or above 60%.

HF indicates heart failure; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.

### Breakthroughs in the treatment of heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^1139o6ZP]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Evolution of terminologies for heart failure (HF)**: The classification of heart failure with ejection fraction (EF) greater than 40% has evolved. Clinical trials for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have utilized varying cutoffs for enrollment, typically denoting a range of greater than 40% to 50%. This arbitrary range lacks a clinical or pathophysiological basis. According to recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 52% in men and 54% in women is considered the lower end of normal. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that patients with an LVEF of 41% to 49% experience significant systolic dysfunction and may be categorized as having heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Most HFrEF clinical trials have systematically excluded this specific LVEF group as part of an enrichment strategy. This cohort presents low event rates, such as death, requiring a higher sample size to conduct adequately powered trials. A post-hoc analysis from the CHARM-preserved trial revealed that angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy was most effective within the LVEF range of 41% to 49%, with diminishing efficacy observed with increasing LVEF.

Following these findings, interest in further characterizing the LVEF range of 41% to 49% increased. Initially termed HFpEF (borderline), it was formally renamed to heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2013. Subsequent studies have indicated that heart failure with LVEF 41% to 49% shares more similarities with HFrEF than with HFpEF. Evidence from the CHARM program and the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Long-Term Registry supports these findings.

### Cotellic [^112KUt4K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cardiomyopathy is defined as a symptomatic and asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can occur with Cotellic. The safety of Cotellic has not been established in patients with a baseline LVEF either below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN) or below 50%.

- **Trial 1 results**: Patients were assessed for decreases in LVEF by echocardiograms or MUGA at baseline, Week 5, Week 17, Week 29, Week 43, and then every 4 to 6 months thereafter while receiving treatment. A Grade 2 or 3 decrease in LVEF occurred in 26% of patients receiving Cotellic with vemurafenib and 19% of patients receiving vemurafenib. The median time to the first onset of LVEF decrease was 4 months (range: 23 days to 13 months). Of the patients with decreased LVEF, 22% had dose interruption and/or reduction, and 14% required permanent discontinuation. Decreased LVEF resolved to above the LLN or within 10% of baseline in 62% of patients receiving Cotellic, with a median time to resolution of 3 months (range: 4 days to 12 months).

- **Trial 2 results**: In patients with histiocytic neoplasms, 8% of patients experienced a Grade 2 ejection fraction decrease, and 12% experienced Grade 3–4 events. The median time to the first onset of LVEF decrease was 29 days (range: 22 days to 114 days). Of the patients with decreased LVEF, all had dose interruption and/or reduction, and none required permanent discontinuation. Decreased LVEF resolved to above the LLN or within 10% of baseline in 60% of patients receiving Cotellic, with a median time to resolution of 31 days (range: 13 days to 126 days).

### The use of left ventricular ejection fraction in the diagnosis and management of heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the ESC, the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and the Japanese Heart Failure Society (JHFS) [^113LprWF]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). High credibility.

This clinical consensus statement revisits the role of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as a measurement of cardiac function, a prognostic marker, and a major criterion to classify patients with heart failure. It provides new guidance for clinical practice. Heart failure is traditionally classified based on LVEF thresholds, which has major implications for treatment recommendations. However, the reproducibility of LVEF measurement is poor, and its prognostic and diagnostic value diminishes when it is above 45%, showing no relationship with the severity of either cardiac dysfunction or outcomes at higher values. These limitations highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to classify and assess heart failure, focusing more on the trajectory of LVEF rather than its absolute value.

Furthermore, the assessment of LVEF is not required for the initiation of treatments like sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and diuretics in patients with suspected de novo heart failure and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Future research utilizing advanced imaging techniques and biomarkers, which can better characterize myocardial structure, metabolism, and performance, may facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets and improved methods to monitor heart failure therapies across the entire spectrum of LVEF.

### Left ventricular geometry as a major determinant of left ventricular ejection fraction: Physiological considerations and clinical implications [^1153RyGb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

The limited myocardial fiber thickening and shortening alone cannot explain the marked left ventricular (LV) volume reduction during LV ejection. This reduction can only be achieved with the LV helical (spiral) orientation of myocardial fibers, which is determined by the non-contractile LV myocardial components (intrasarcomeric and extrasarcomeric cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix). Preservation of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in heart failure (HF) is due to the presence of a normal ellipsoid LV configuration and spiral myocardial fiber orientation. Conversely, a reduction of LVEF in HF results from spherical LV configuration associated with impaired myocardial fiber orientation.

These mechanisms are supported by the fact that biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis are strong predictors of LV reverse remodeling in HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF), and therapeutic interventions in HFrEF that retard or inhibit extracellular matrix remodeling are effective, whereas those that increase myocardial contractility are ineffective. Thus, the classification of HF based on LVEF should be revised, and future therapy in HF should focus on interventions affecting the non-contractile LV myocardial components rather than on LV myocardial contractility.

### Diastolic heart failure can be diagnosed by comprehensive two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography [^111QqbVa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

There are many myocardial and non-myocardial conditions that cause heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Among them, diastolic heart failure, which is heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction, is the most common cause of heart failure with normal LVEF. Diastolic heart failure can be diagnosed by comprehensive two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, which demonstrates abnormal myocardial relaxation, decreased compliance, and increased filling pressure with normal LV dimensions and preserved LVEF. Therefore, diastolic heart failure should always be considered when LVEF is normal on two-dimensional echocardiography in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure.

The diagnosis can be confirmed if Doppler echocardiography and myocardial tissue imaging provide evidence for impaired myocardial relaxation (e.g. decreased longitudinal velocity of the mitral annulus during early diastole and decreased propagation velocity of mitral inflow), decreased compliance (e.g. shortened mitral A-wave duration and mitral deceleration time), and increased filling pressure (e.g. shortened isovolumic relaxation time and an increased ratio between early diastolic mitral and mitral annular velocities).

Early identification of diastolic dysfunction in asymptomatic patients using echocardiography may provide an opportunity to manage the underlying etiology and prevent progression to diastolic heart failure.

### Echocardiographic features beyond ejection fraction and associated outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^113QN7s8]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to classify patients and guide therapy implementation. However, LVEF alone may be insufficient to adequately characterize patients with HF, especially those with mildly reduced or preserved LVEF. Recommendations on additional testing are lacking, and there are limited data on the use of echocardiographic features beyond LVEF in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved LVEF.

- **Methods**: In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved LVEF identified in a large US healthcare system, the association of the following metrics with mortality was evaluated: LV global longitudinal strain (LV GLS > -16), left atrial volume index (> 28 mL/m²), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and E/e´ > 13. Of the 1,255 patients studied, 498 (40%) demonstrated abnormal LV GLS.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac imaging, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend reassessing LVEF in patients undergoing treatment with any cardiotoxic agent and presenting with unexplained signs and symptoms, such as sinus tachycardia, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, peripheral edema, or ascites.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in perspective [^111PtTfe]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction that is not markedly abnormal. Despite initial surprise, heightened risks for heart failure-specific major adverse events occur across the broad range of ejection fractions, including normal. The recognition of the magnitude of the problem of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the past 20 years has spurred an explosion of clinical investigation and a growing number of informative outcome trials. This article addresses the historic development of this component of the heart failure syndrome, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and existing and planned therapeutic studies. Looking forward, more specific phenotyping and even genotyping of subpopulations should lead to improvements in outcomes from future trials.

### Left ventricular dysfunction in patients receiving cardiotoxic cancer therapies: Are clinicians responding optimally [^1118JBUP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine treatment practices for cancer therapy-associated decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) detected on echocardiography and whether management was consistent with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

Patients treated with anthracyclines or trastuzumab are at risk of cardiotoxicity. Decreased LVEF represents a Class I indication for drug intervention according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

Patients receiving anthracycline or trastuzumab at Stanford University from October 2005 to October 2007 and who had undergone echocardiography before and after receiving an anthracycline or trastuzumab were identified. A chart review examined chemotherapy regimens, cardiac risk factors, imaging results, concomitant medications, and cardiology consultations.

Eighty-eight patients received therapy with an anthracycline or trastuzumab and had a pre-treatment and follow-up echocardiogram. Ninety-two percent were treated with anthracyclines, 17% with trastuzumab after an anthracycline, and 8% with trastuzumab without previous treatment with anthracycline. The mean baseline LVEF was 60%, with 14% having a baseline < 55%. Forty percent had decreased LVEF (< 55%) after anthracycline and/or trastuzumab treatment. Of these patients, 40% received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, 51% beta-blocker therapy, and 54% cardiology consultation. Of patients with asymptomatic decreased LVEF, 31% received further treatment or consultation.

### The many faces of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1125yr12]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction are characterized by a normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction. However, there is marked heterogeneity in the extent of other cardiac structural and functional abnormalities. Improved appreciation of this diversity might provide insights into prognosis and therapeutic interventions.

### Serial changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and outcomes in outpatients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113xwLrM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the course of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) among outpatients with heart failure (HF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and its impact on outcomes. We evaluated 322 consecutive outpatients with confirmed HF, LVEF > 40%, no previous LVEF ≤ 40%, and no specific cardiomyopathies or primary right-sided or valvular heart disease. The median age was 73 years (interquartile range: 63 to 82); 57.1% were women, 50.3% White, and 45.0% Black; the median LVEF was 55% (50% to 60%); and 45.6% had coronary artery disease.

After a median of 37 months (32 to 38) and 4.5 follow-up echocardiograms (4 to 6) per patient, 11.4% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2% to 17.7%) developed LVEF < 40%. Baseline systolic blood pressure higher than 130 mm Hg was associated with more LVEF decline. During follow-up, 50 patients died (3-year mortality 15.3%) and 67 additional patients were hospitalized for HF (3-year death plus HF hospitalization 35.6%). Development of LVEF < 40% was subsequently followed by 5-fold higher mortality in time-updated models (adjusted HR 4.91; 95% CI 2.00 to 12.0; p = 0.001) and 3.5-fold higher rates of death or HF hospitalization (adjusted HR 3.70; 95% CI 1.67 to 8.19; p = 0.001). Interval coronary events were infrequent (10%) among patients with deteriorated LVEF. The impact of LVEF changes on outcomes was similar in White and Black patients.

In conclusion, a proportion of patients with HFpEF will develop reduced LVEF over time.

- **Indications and usage**: Entresto is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal. Additionally, it is used for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients aged one year and older. Entresto reduces NT-proBNP and is expected to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Adult heart failure**: Entresto is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with LVEF below normal. LVEF is a variable measure, so use clinical judgment in deciding whom to treat [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Comparison of four echocardiographic techniques for measuring left ventricular ejection fraction [^114nWJuR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Accurate quantitative measurement of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) by two-dimensional echocardiography is limited by subjective visual endocardial border detection. Both harmonic and precision contrast microbubbles provide better delineation of endocardial borders than fundamental imaging. The aim of this study was to correlate two-dimensional echocardiographic quantification of LVEF measured by four currently available techniques with radionuclide angiography.

A total of 50 patients who underwent radionuclide (EF) measurement (47 of 50 had technically difficult echocardiograms by fundamental imaging) underwent echocardiography by four methods: fundamental alone, fundamental with contrast, harmonic alone, and harmonic with contrast. Three echocardiologists measured the biplane two-dimensional echocardiographic LVEF independently and were blinded to radionuclide angiography. The correlation of echocardiographic EF with radionuclide EF improved incrementally with each method. However, contrast with harmonic imaging provided the closest correlation (r = 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95 as assessed by the three independent analysts).

### The significance of left ventricular ejection time in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115VP1AX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Left ventricular ejection time (LVET) is defined as the time interval from aortic valve opening to aortic valve closure and is the phase of systole during which the left ventricle ejects blood into the aorta. LVET has been used for several decades to assess left ventricular function and contractility. However, there is recent interest in LVET as a measure of therapeutic action for novel drugs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), since LVET is shortened in these patients.

This review provides an overview of the available information on LVET, including methods of measuring LVET, mechanistic understanding of LVET, association of LVET with outcomes, mechanisms behind shortened LVET in HFrEF, and the potential implications of drugs that affect and normalize LVET.

### Imaging modality for left ventricular ejection fraction estimation and effect of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator on mortality in patients with heart failure [^113CgEo5]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. Less is known about whether outcomes vary between the two noninvasive imaging modalities used to estimate LVEF: 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and multigated acquisition radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA), which use different principles, geometric vs. count-based, respectively.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the effect of ICD on mortality in patients with HF and LVEF ≤ 35% varied on the basis of LVEF measured by 2DE or MUGA.

- **Methods**: Of the 2521 patients with HF with LVEF ≤ 35% in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial, 1676 (66%) were randomized to either placebo or ICD. Of these, 1386 (83%) had LVEF measured by 2DE (n = 971) or MUGA (n = 415). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality associated with ICD were estimated overall, checking for interaction, and within the two imaging subgroups.

- **Results**: Of the 1386 patients in the present analysis, all-cause mortality occurred in 23.1% (160 of 692) and 29.7% (206 of 694) of patients randomized to ICD or placebo, respectively [HR 0.77; 97.5% CI 0.61–0.97], which is consistent with that in the 1676 patients in the original report. HRs (97.5% CIs) for all-cause mortality in the 2DE and MUGA subgroups were 0.79 (0.60–1.04) and 0.72 (0.46–1.11), respectively (P = 0.693 for interaction). Similar associations were observed for cardiac and arrhythmic mortalities.

- **Conclusion**: We found no evidence that interaction between the type of imaging modality and the effectiveness of ICDs influences patient outcomes.

### Associations of left ventricular structure and function with blood pressure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^117Pht4E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Data on the association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the structure and function of failing hearts with preserved ejection fraction (EF) are sparse.

- **Methods and results**: This analysis included 935 patients with heart failure (49.4% women; mean age, 69.9 years) with preserved EF (≥ 45%), who were enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) Trial before initiation of randomized therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure (dimensions, wall thickness, and mass index), diastolic function (left atrial volume index, transmitral blood flow, and mitral annular velocities), and systolic function (EF and longitudinal strain) were assessed echocardiographically.

	- In multivariable-adjusted analyses, association sizes expressed per 1-SD (14.8-mm Hg) increment in systolic blood pressure were 0.020 cm (P = 0.003) and 0.018 cm (P = 0.004) for LV septal and posterior wall thickness, respectively, and 2.42 mg/m² (P = 0.018) for LV mass index. The corresponding associations with diastolic blood pressure were nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.067). In similarly adjusted analyses, the association sizes expressed per 1-SD (10.7-mm Hg) increment in diastolic blood pressure were -0.15 for E/A (P < 0.001), -0.76 for E/e' (P = 0.006), and -0.62% for EF (P = 0.024). These findings were consistent if models including systolic blood pressure were additionally adjusted for diastolic blood pressure, and vice versa, albeit that the relation of EF with diastolic blood pressure weakened (-0.54%; P = 0.10).

- **Conclusions**: In diastolic heart failure, the associations of left ventricular structural changes and blood pressure are evident with systolic blood pressure, while diastolic blood pressure showed nonsignificant associations. These intricate dynamics highlight the complex interrelationship between blood pressure and cardiac function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Ejection fraction indexed to left ventricular mass and its association with cardiac event risk in a community population with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^113VwpnN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), typically measured by echocardiography, is widely recognized as the primary indicator of left ventricular systolic function in clinical practice. LVEF serves as the cornerstone for diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis in heart failure, according to recent guidelines. However, LVEF is highly load dependent and relatively insensitive to subtle abnormalities in left ventricular systolic function, which limits its ability to predict future cardiac events in populations with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fractions. Changes in LVEF trajectory or left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) have been used to assess subtle left ventricular function and predict adverse cardiac events. Nevertheless, the complexity and time-consuming nature of measuring LVEF trajectory changes and LVGLS limit their use in clinical scenarios. Therefore, modified LVEF should be developed as a simple echocardiography-derived parameter to predict cardiac events rather than LVEF alone.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) trajectories are important markers of incident cardiovascular events and death. Previous studies have suggested that LVEF adjusted by left ventricular mass (LVM) might improve prognostic risk stratification of cardiac events. LVEF/left ventricular mass (LVM)/body mass index (BMI), in contrast with LVEF alone, was found to be associated with LVGLS. However, prospective cohort studies on the prognostic implications of LVEF in combination with LVM in community-dwelling populations with mildly reduced ejection fractions are still needed.

### Factors associated with maintenance of an improved ejection fraction: An echocardiogram-based registry study [^117ULbTK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

The distribution of ejection fraction during follow-up (third echocardiogram) by baseline left ventricular end diastolic volume quartiles (A) and left ventricular end systolic volume quartiles (B) is depicted for participants with heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) at the second echocardiogram.

Participants with HFimpEF in the higher LVEDV or LVESV quartile at the study baseline (second echocardiogram) were less likely to maintain an LVEF > 40% at follow-up compared to participants in the lower LVEDV and LVESV quartiles, respectively. Here, ECHO indicates echocardiogram; LVEDV stands for left ventricular end-diastolic volume; LVESV refers to left ventricular end-systolic volume; and LVEF3 is the left ventricular ejection fraction at follow-up (third echocardiogram).

### Why and when do patients with heart failure and normal left ventricular ejection fraction die? Analysis of > 600 deaths in a community long-term study [^114D5HZW]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to examine the causes of death in patients with heart failure (HF) and evaluate the differences between patients with and without depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

- **Method**: All patients hospitalized with HF between 1995 and 2002 in the cardiology service of a tertiary hospital were assessed. LVEF was evaluated by echocardiography during hospitalization and was considered normal when it was ≥ 50%. After a mean follow-up time of 3.7 ± 2.8 years, 615 cases had resulted in death.

- **Results**: The most common cause was refractory HF in the whole group (39%) and both subgroups defined with respect to LVEF (normal and depressed). There was no statistically significant difference between the normal and depressed subgroups regarding the distribution of deaths, although the depressed group showed a somewhat greater incidence of sudden death (21% vs. 16% in the normal group) and a somewhat smaller incidence of death due to refractory HF (37% vs. 47%). In the depressed LVEF group, the cumulative risk of death due to acute myocardial infarction first increased rapidly in the first 1.5 years and then more slowly. In contrast, in the normal left ventricular systolic function group, the cumulative risks of death from noncardiovascular or vascular noncardiac causes initially increased more rapidly before slowing.

- **Conclusions**: The spectrum of causes of death among hospitalized HF patients is independent of LVEF.

### Predictors and outcomes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction above or below 60 [^11763TRr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

We showed in a multicenter observational cohort study that prognostic factors distinctly differ between patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% ≤ LVEF < 60% versus those with 60% ≤ LVEF. These findings suggest that there are underlying pathophysiologic differences between these subgroups, upon which therapeutic strategies should be arranged.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Classification based upon phenotype is essential for diagnosis and treatment [^112FmbDd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is classified based upon the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous disorder with increasing prevalence in the elderly that remains incompletely understood and inadequately treated as no therapy has shown favorable effects. In this review, we summarize the theories regarding HFpEF pathogenesis, propose a phenotype-based classification of HFpEF, discuss prevention strategies, explain why clinical trials on HFpEF treatment have failed, and make suggestions for the future.

### Empagliflozin for heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with and without diabetes [^114MTTEn]. Circulation (2022). Low credibility.

Although prespecified, this study is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial and, as such, its results should be interpreted with caution. In patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) and an ejection fraction greater than 40%, empagliflozin improved HF outcomes in both patients with and without diabetes. Empagliflozin provides consistent benefits across the spectrum of chronic HF, regardless of the presence of diabetes.

### Beyond ejection fraction: an integrative approach for assessment of cardiac structure and function in heart failure [^115enepZ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has been the central parameter used for diagnosis and management in patients with heart failure. A good predictor of adverse outcomes in heart failure when below ∼45%, LVEF is less useful as a marker of risk as it approaches normal. As a measure of cardiac function, ejection fraction has several important limitations. Calculated as the stroke volume divided by end-diastolic volume, the estimation of ejection fraction is generally based on geometric assumptions that allow for assessment of volumes based on linear or two-dimensional measurements.

LVEF is preload- and afterload-dependent, can change substantially based on loading conditions, is only moderately reproducible, and represents only a single measure of risk in patients with heart failure. Moreover, the relationship between ejection fraction and risk in patients with heart failure is modified by factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and renal function. A more complete evaluation and understanding of left ventricular function in patients with heart failure requires a more comprehensive assessment. We conceptualize an integrative approach that incorporates measures of left and right ventricular function, left ventricular geometry, left atrial size, and valvular function, as well as non-imaging factors such as clinical parameters and biomarkers, providing a comprehensive and accurate prediction of risk in heart failure.

### Compare: Comparison of the effects of carvedilol CR and carvedilol IR on left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with heart failure [^111KaAEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important measure of ventricular function in the evaluation of heart failure. Immediate-release (IR) carvedilol administered twice daily has been shown to improve LVEF in subjects with ischemic and nonischemic chronic heart failure. A once-daily formulation, controlled-release (CR) carvedilol, is expected to improve quality of care through improved adherence due to the reduced frequency of dosing.

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in subjects with stable chronic heart failure will compare the change in LVEF in patients receiving carvedilol IR with those receiving carvedilol CR. LVEF will be measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography at 6 months after entry into the maintenance period of the study drug.

- **Secondary objectives**: The secondary objectives of this study are to assess changes in left ventricular remodeling and function, to evaluate changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels, and to determine the incidence of all-cause and heart failure-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality after treatment with carvedilol CR or carvedilol IR.

### Left ventricular ejection fraction assessment by emergency physician-performed bedside echocardiography: A prospective comparative evaluation of multiple modalities [^114Bo9WB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although there is some support for visual estimation (VE) as an accurate method to estimate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), it is also scrutinized for its subjectivity. Therefore, more objective assessments, such as fractional shortening (FS) or e-point septal separation (EPSS), may be useful in estimating LVEF among patients in the emergency department (ED).

- **Objective**: Our aim was to compare the real-world accuracy of VE, FS, and EPSS using a sample of point-of-care cardiac ultrasound transthoracic echocardiography (POC-TTE) images acquired by emergency physicians (EPs) with the gold standard of Simpson's method of discs, as measured by comprehensive cardiology-performed echocardiography.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-site prospective observational study comparing VE, FS, and EPSS to assess LVEF. Adult patients in the ED receiving both POC-TTE and comprehensive cardiology TTE were included. EPs acquired POC-TTE images and videos that were then interpreted by two blinded EPs who were fellowship-trained in emergency ultrasound. EPs estimated LVEF using VE, FS, and EPSS. The primary outcome was accuracy.

- **Results**: Between April and May 2018, 125 patients were enrolled and 113 were included in the final analysis. EP1 and EP2 had a κ of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.00) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.91–1.00), respectively, for VE compared with the gold standard, a κ of 0.40 (95% CI 0.23–0.57) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.18–0.57), respectively, for EPSS compared with the gold standard, and a κ of 0.70 (95% CI 0.54–0.85) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.50–0.81), respectively, for FS.

### Cardiotoxic effect of modern anthracycline dosing on left ventricular ejection fraction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo arms from randomized controlled trials [^115rGFRu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The fixed-effects model assumes that the left ventricular ejection fraction decline in one study is the same as the values of the other studies, where the differences are only from sampling error. A random-effects model assumes that the left ventricular ejection fraction declines are not identical but follow some distribution. We reported left ventricular ejection fraction decline using the random-effects model (i.e. 5.4 percentage point declines) as our primary endpoint to provide a conservative estimate of the magnitude of cardiotoxicity, and the fixed-effects model as secondary (3.9 percentage point declines).

### Reverse atrial remodeling in heart failure with recovered ejection fraction [^111Yt2gv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the main parameter used for the classification of heart failure (HF). The latest European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines recommend that HF be divided into three distinct phenotypes: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤ 40%), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 50%), and heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41–49%).

An additional diagnostic criterion for heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecEF) is that the second echocardiographic examination must be at least 3 to 6 months after the first, and it should show a recovery of LVEF to > 40%.

### Outcomes and left ventricular ejection fraction in cardiac magnetic resonance: Challenging the "higher is better" [^112Uf1Bv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

In patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% to 70% was associated with the lowest event rate. The highest risk was observed in patients with LVEF greater than 70%, demonstrating higher event rates than those in the group with 60% to 70% LVEF. A supranormal LVEF emerges as an entity requiring specialized attention regarding cause and management.

### Breakthroughs in the treatment of heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^113nKd5u]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is currently classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The LVEF cutoffs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have not changed much since randomized controlled trials first started using LVEF as a parameter for HF diagnosis and trial enrollment, the first of which was the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study (V-HeFT-I) in 1986. The LVEF cutoff for HFrEF has consistently remained at 40%.

The term underwent multiple modifications over the years; it was first changed to HF with normal EF. This change in nomenclature was borne out of necessity. First, there was no reliable way to assess diastolic dysfunction using noninvasive modalities to ascertain if patients with normal EF truly had diastolic dysfunction. Second, patients with diastolic dysfunction commonly have some degree of systolic dysfunction, so labeling patients with LVEF > 40% as having only diastolic dysfunction would not be entirely accurate. The Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) preserved trial was one of the first dedicated studies in patients with LVEF > 40% to evaluate efficacy and outcomes effectively.

### Effect of increased body mass index on accuracy of two-dimensional echocardiography for measurement of left ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and mass [^117GHu69]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

We used 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography to determine left ventricular volume, mass, and ejection fraction in overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m²), obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), and control (BMI < 25 kg/m²) subjects. Compared with corresponding magnetic resonance imaging measurements, 3-dimensional echocardiography is more accurate than 2-dimensional echocardiography in all patients, but particularly in overweight and obese subjects.

### The risk of death according to left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular dilatation in 17 321 adults with heart failure from 40 high-, middle- and low-income countries - a Global Congestive Heart Failure (G-CHF) study [^116vMEuJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

The relationship between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and death varied based on heart failure etiology (interaction p = 0.0010). In ischaemic heart failure and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a continuous inverse association was observed between LVEF and the risk of death. However, in hypertensive, valvular, and other heart failure types, there was no association between LVEF and mortality risk. The relationship between right ventricular (RV) size and death also differed according to heart failure etiology (interaction p = 0.019).

In ischaemic heart failure, hypertensive heart failure, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, RV enlargement was strongly associated with mortality, with respective hazard ratios (HR): 1.40 (95% CI 1.25–1.58, p < 0.0001), 1.51 (95% CI 1.31–1.73, p < 0.0001), and 1.35 (95% CI 1.14–1.60, p < 0.0001). However, this association was weaker in valvular/rheumatic heart failure, with HR 1.18 (95% CI 0.97–1.43, p = 0.092).

When patients were categorized into ischaemic/idiopathic cardiomyopathy versus other heart failure etiologies, RV enlargement was associated with a worse prognosis irrespective of LVEF. In ischaemic/idiopathic cardiomyopathies, LVEF ≥ 40% identified subgroups of patients with normal and enlarged right ventricles who experienced less mortality compared to patients with LVEF < 40%.

### Ejection fraction indexed to left ventricular mass and its association with cardiac event risk in a community population with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^114Fq11N]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

In this community-based prospective cohort study, compared with LVEF alone, LVEF/LVM, LVEF/LVM/BSA, and LVEF/LVM/BMI were independently associated with the 5-year risk of new cardiac events in a population with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Furthermore, lower LVEF/LVM/BSA and LVEF/LVM/BMI values were found in participants with hypertension and diabetes, the most common underlying causes and precursor states of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Our 5.52-year follow-up analysis suggested that LVEF indexed by LVM may provide incremental information over LVEF alone for cardiac event association in a population with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. This suggests that these indexed parameters may be more physiologically relevant and could better identify individuals at high risk for cardiac events than LVEF alone.

Despite the remarkable development of emerging imaging technologies, LVEF measured by echocardiography remains the most common indicator of left ventricular systolic function. It is considered the cornerstone of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in patients with heart failure in both common clinical practice and research trials; its application is recommended in recent guidelines. However, LVEF may not be sufficiently sensitive to convey subtle changes in left ventricular systolic function. This limitation is evidenced by its inability to identify a gradation of risk in participants with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. To address this issue, LVEF trajectory changes and LVGLS have been introduced.

### Comparison of visual estimation and quantitative measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction in untrained perioperative echocardiographers [^115GBFjd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Perioperative evaluation of the left ventricular systolic function is essential information to help diagnose and manage life-threatening perioperative emergencies. Although quantifying the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is recommended to determine the left ventricular function, it may not always be feasible in emergency perioperative settings. This study compared the visual estimation of LVEF (eyeballing) by noncardiac anesthesiologists with the quantitative LVEF measured using a modified Simpson's biplane method.

- **Methods**: Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) studies of 35 patients were selected, and three different echocardiographic views (the mid-esophageal four-chamber view, the mid-esophageal two-chamber view, and the transgastric mid-papillary short axis view) were recovered from each study and displayed in random order. Two cardiac anesthesiologists certified in perioperative echocardiography independently measured LVEF using the modified Simpson method and categorized LVEF into five grades: hyperdynamic LVEF, normal, mildly reduced LVEF, moderately reduced LVEF, and severely reduced LVEF. Seven noncardiac anesthesiologists with limited experience in echocardiography also reviewed the same TEE studies, estimated the LVEF, and graded LV function. The precision of the LV function classification and the correlation between visual estimation of LVEF and quantitative LVEF were calculated. The agreement of measurements between the two methods was also assessed.

- **Results**: Pearson's correlation between the LVEF estimated by the participants and the quantified LVEF was calculated to assess the level of agreement.

### Performance of 3-dimensional echocardiography in measuring left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Pfyom]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The primary aim of this systematic review is to objectively evaluate the test performance characteristics of three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) in measuring left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF). Despite its growing use in clinical laboratories, the accuracy of 3DE has not been studied on a large scale. It is unclear if this technology offers an advantage over traditional two-dimensional (2D) methods.

- **Methods**: We searched for studies that compared LV volumes and EF measured by 3DE and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. A subset of those also compared standard 2D methods with CMR. We used meta-analyses to determine the overall bias and limits of agreement of LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and EF measured by 3DE and 2D echocardiography (2DE).

- **Results**: Twenty-three studies (1,638 echocardiograms) were included. The pooled biases ± 2 SDs for 3DE were -19.1 ± 34.2 ml, -10.1 ± 29.7 ml, and -0.6 ± 11.8% for EDV, ESV, and EF, respectively. Nine studies also included data from 2DE, where the pooled biases were -48.2 ± 55.9 ml, -27.7 ± 45.7 ml, and 0.1 ± 13.9% for EDV, ESV, and EF, respectively. In this subset, the difference in bias between 3DE and 2D volumes was statistically significant (p = 0.01 for both EDV and ESV). The difference in variance was statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all 3 measurements.

- **Conclusions**: Three-dimensional echocardiography underestimates volumes and has wide limits of agreement, but compared with traditional 2D methods in these carefully performed studies, 3DE.

### Phenotyping heart failure according to the longitudinal ejection fraction change: Myocardial strain, predictors, and outcomes [^111UxnZy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Many patients with heart failure experience changes in left ventricular ejection fraction during follow-up. We sought to evaluate the predictors and outcomes of different phenotypes according to longitudinal changes in left ventricular ejection fraction.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 2104 patients with acute heart failure underwent echocardiography at baseline and follow-up. Global longitudinal strain was measured at index admission. Heart failure phenotypes were defined as:
	- Persistent heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (persistent HFrEF, LVEF ≤ 40% at baseline and follow-up)
	- Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40% at baseline and improved to > 40% at follow-up)
	- Heart failure with declined ejection fraction (LVEF > 40% at baseline and declined to ≤ 40% at follow-up)
	- Persistent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (persistent HFpEF, LVEF > 40% at baseline and follow-up)

	- Overall, 1130 patients had HFrEF at baseline. During follow-up, 54.2% had persistent HFrEF and 46.8% had heart failure with improved ejection fraction. Among 975 patients with HFpEF at baseline, 89.5% had persistent HFpEF and 10.5% had heart failure with declined ejection fraction at follow-up. The 5-year all-cause mortality rates were 43.1% for heart failure with declined ejection fraction, 33.1% for persistent HFrEF, 24% for persistent HFpEF, and 17% for heart failure with improved ejection fraction. In multivariable analyses, each 1% increase in global longitudinal strain (greater contractility) was associated with 10% increased odds for heart failure with improved ejection fraction.

### Usefulness of heart failure categories based on left ventricular ejection fraction [^113w7kCy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure is associated with high mortality and morbidity, as well as being one of the costliest diseases to society. Heart failure guidelines mandate treatment based on patients' left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), categorized as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; LVEF ≥ 50%), and the relatively recent addition, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF; LVEF 41%–49%). These LVEF‐based groups could be reasonable if the LVEF distribution were bimodal, reflecting two clearly different groups determined by the cause of the heart failure. They are further motivated by the development of much of the evidence behind heart failure treatments in groups defined by low LVEF. Recent studies of SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose transport protein 2) inhibitors have demonstrated effects of those drugs on important efficacy outcomes across the LVEF spectrum, calling these LVEF categories into question and reigniting the discussion of the shape of the LVEF distribution.

Because heart failure is a clinical syndrome with many causes, heterogeneity between patients is expected. Furthermore, biological variability within patients in measures such as LVEF is substantial, with additional variability attributable to the echocardiography method, inconsistencies in imaging quality, and experience of the examiner. Categorization of continuous variables with substantial variability into narrow groups, and basing treatment decisions on such categories, is problematic.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1175zZR5]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Half of patients with heart failure (HF) have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Morbidity and mortality in HFpEF are similar to values observed in patients with HF and reduced EF, yet no effective treatment has been identified. While early research focused on the importance of diastolic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, recent studies have revealed that multiple non-diastolic abnormalities in cardiovascular function also contribute. Diagnosis of HFpEF is frequently challenging and relies upon careful clinical evaluation, echo-Doppler cardiography, and invasive haemodynamic assessment. In this review, the principal mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and clinical trials are reviewed, along with a discussion of novel treatment strategies that are currently under investigation or hold promise for the future.

### The death rate among hospitalized heart failure patients with normal and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction in the year following discharge: evolution over a 10-year period [^113sm2Tk]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in clinical characteristics and treatment strategies between 1991 and 2001 have impacted the survival of patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure (CHF). Specifically, the study looked at whether patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 50%) differ in survival outcomes compared to those with depressed LVEF.

Methods and results: We studied 1,482 patients admitted to the Cardiology Service of a tertiary Spanish hospital over 10 years with CHF. Among the 1,110 patients for whom LVEF was evaluated, the prevalence of normal LVEF rose from 37% in the period 1991–96 (Period 1) to 47% in the period 2000–2001 (Period 3). The intensity of both diagnostic and therapeutic measures also increased during this 10-year period. The 1-year survival rate remained virtually unchanged in the entire patient group, being 82%, 84%, and 82% in Periods 1, 2 (1997–99), and 3, respectively. The prognosis of patients with depressed LVEF (< 50%) improved significantly, with 1-year survival rates of 76%, 77%, and 84% in Periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conversely, the normal LVEF group had decreasing 1-year survival rates of 88%, 86%, and 81% in Periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively, although the increased risk of death was not statistically significant.

The conclusion of the study highlights that while the death rate among hospitalized CHF patients with depressed LVEF during the first year after discharge has tended to fall over the past 10 years, the application of clinical guidelines has not resulted in a similar decrease for patients with normal LVEF. This situation underscores a need for further investigation and potential adjustment in treatment approaches for this subgroup.

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^112RK3PR]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

When addressing diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, particularly in relation to cardiac imaging, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend reassessing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)/strain every three months in asymptomatic patients. This is applicable to those receiving cardiotoxic anticancer therapy with a normal LVEF, but who exhibit a decrease in average global longitudinal strain from the baseline assessment (≥ 12% relative decrease or ≥ 5% absolute decrease). LVEF/strain should be reassessed if there is suspected cardiac toxicity based on a cardiac physical examination or symptoms.

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European Journal of Heart Failure expert consensus document [^115jF7Rw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). High credibility.

Eligibility criteria for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in clinical practice guidelines indicate that many clinical guidelines consider eligibility for ICD implantation according to primary and secondary prevention.

Secondary prevention refers to patients who have survived a life-threatening VA and remain hemodynamically unstable in the absence of reversible causes or later than 48 hours after myocardial infarction. Clinicians should ensure the patient has a good functional status and an estimated life expectancy of more than one year.

Primary prevention is recommended in symptomatic patients (NYHA class II–III) with an LVEF ≤ 35%. Patients should have an estimated life expectancy of more than one year, have good functional status, and be on optimal medical therapy. Recent guidelines recommend the use of risk prediction models for those, often younger, patients with inheritable arrhythmogenic diseases. The 2023 ESC cardiomyopathy guidelines recommend that patients with a secondary prevention ICD indication who are temporarily ineligible for ICD implantation may be provided with a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### State of the science in women's cardiovascular disease: A Canadian perspective on the influence of sex and gender [^113kTE67]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **HF with reduced ejection fraction**: Approximately 40% of patients having heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, defined by left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, are women. They are older at diagnosis and live longer with the condition but experience more severe symptoms, more physical limitations (reduced 6‐minute walk distance), a greater prevalence of anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life than men. Women are also more often obese and have a higher prevalence of hypertension, valvular heart disease (VHD), and nonischemic cardiomyopathy than men. They are less likely than men to smoke, consume alcohol, or have preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. Women with HF with reduced ejection fraction have more strokes than men (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.59). This may be a result of significantly lower anticoagulation rates for the management of AF (26.7% in women versus 32.4% in men) and higher prevalence of hypertension (70.6% in women versus 65.5% in men).

- **HF with preserved ejection fraction**: After adjusting for age and other risk factors, the risk of HF with preserved ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) is fairly similar in men and women, although the risk increases sharply with age. Associated comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, and CAD become more impactful in women as they generally live longer than men. Women with HF with preserved ejection fraction may present differently from men, showing symptoms such as cognitive impairment, delirium, nausea, abdominal discomfort, oliguria, anorexia, and cyanosis.

### Assessing lv contractility identifies populations with preserved ejection fraction at risk of adverse heart failure outcomes [^115KQ6BK]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an essential tool for heart failure (HF) assessment but is limited by load dependence. Additional tools are needed to risk-stratify normal LVEF populations. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of systolic blood pressure-indexed left ventricular end-systolic volume ratio, or cardiac contractility index (CCI).

In a prospective observational cohort study of people newly diagnosed with HF, we defined characteristics and outcomes associated with LVEF and CCI, including after stratification into HF with reduced ejection fraction or HF with preserved ejection fraction. We used UK Biobank to assess whether CCI is associated with subclinical myocardial dysfunction and incident HF.

In people with HF, mortality increased over tertiles of declining CCI (P < 0.001). Within the HF preserved ejection fraction group, below-median CCI was associated with distinct clinical characteristics and an all-cause mortality risk approximately twice that of those with above-median CCI (observed event rate 17.3/100 patient-years versus 8.8/100 patient-years; P < 0.001), similar to those with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Modeled as continuous variables, there was a curvilinear relationship between mortality across the detected range of CCI, while there was no clear association with mortality risk across a wide range of LVEF (20%-55%). In UK Biobank for participants without HF and normal LVEF, below-median CCI was associated with ≈33% increased risk of incident heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33 [1.01–1.75]; P < 0.001).

### Trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction after acute decompensation for systolic heart failure: Concomitant echocardiographic and systemic changes, predictors, and impact on clinical outcomes [^116wbNdK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Prospective longitudinal follow-up of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) trajectories after acute cardiac decompensation of heart failure is lacking. We investigated changes in LVEF and covariates at a 6-month follow-up in patients with a predischarge LVEF ≤ 40% and determined predictors and prognostic implications of LVEF changes through an 18-month follow-up.

- **Methods and Results**: Interdisciplinary Network Heart Failure program participants (n = 633) were categorized into subgroups based on LVEF at a 6-month follow-up: normalized LVEF (> 50%; heart failure with normalized ejection fraction, n = 147), midrange LVEF (41%–50%; heart failure with midrange ejection fraction, n = 195), or persistently reduced LVEF (≤ 40%; heart failure with persistently reduced LVEF, n = 291). All received guideline-directed medical therapies. At a 6-month follow-up, compared with patients with heart failure with persistently reduced LVEF, heart failure with normalized LVEF or heart failure with midrange LVEF subgroups showed greater reductions in LV end-diastolic/end-systolic diameters (both P < 0.001) and left atrial systolic diameter (P = 0.002), more increased septal/posterior end-diastolic wall-thickness (both P < 0.001), and significantly greater improvement in diastolic function, biomarkers, symptoms, and health status. Heart failure duration < 1 year, female sex, higher predischarge blood pressure, and baseline LVEF were independent predictors of LVEF improvement. Mortality and event-free survival rates were lower in patients with heart failure with normalized LVEF (P = 0.002).
