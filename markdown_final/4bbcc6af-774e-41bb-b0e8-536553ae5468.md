## Question

gabapentin taper

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gabapentin tapering, including when to taper, how to taper, special populations, monitoring, and documentation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications and risks that necessitate tapering. Then, I should verify the minimum taper duration and how to individualize the schedule. Next, I will examine practical dose-reduction strategies, including tablet splitting and formulation choices. After that, I need to consider special populations such as older adults, those with renal impairment, and patients with substance use disorder. Finally, I should review monitoring, symptom management, and documentation requirements, and close with a concise synthesis of the plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale for tapering gabapentin rather than abrupt discontinuation. The FDA labeling warns that abrupt or rapid discontinuation of gabapentinoids can increase seizure risk and precipitate withdrawal symptoms, and it advises tapering over at least one week, with longer tapers considered based on clinical judgment, which aligns with the principle that antiepileptics should not be stopped abruptly due to seizure risk and withdrawal phenomena [^111tFjej] [^116XCHAZ] [^111zVT8B]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies beyond epilepsy. Yes, postmarketing reports document withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of gabapentin even outside epilepsy indications, reinforcing the need for a planned taper in long-term users [^111tFjej].

> I need to check the minimum duration and how to individualize the taper. The FDA minimum is one week, but for patients on higher doses, longer duration of therapy, or those with a history of withdrawal or seizure risk, extending the taper to several weeks or even months is prudent, mirroring the conservative pacing used for benzodiazepine tapers where 5–10% reductions every 2–4 weeks are typical and 25% every 2 weeks is often too fast for many patients [^111tFjej] [^111wCmGW] [^1163PgG2]. Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative source explicitly endorses multi-week tapers for gabapentin; while the FDA sets a one-week minimum, case literature and expert practice support slower schedules for high-risk or long-term users, so I should frame this as a risk-stratified, individualized approach rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^115LBYhP] [^111tFjej].

> Next, I should review practical dose-reduction strategies. For patients on divided TID dosing, reducing the total daily dose by about 10–25% at each step while maintaining the same frequency is reasonable, with longer intervals between reductions if symptoms emerge. For example, decreasing from 900 mg/day to 675 mg/day and holding for 1–2 weeks before the next reduction, then repeating until the lowest feasible dose is reached before stopping, which mirrors benzodiazepine taper pacing principles and aligns with the FDA's minimum one-week per decrement guidance [^111wCmGW] [^116XCHAZ]. Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific nuances; gastroretentive gabapentin (Gralise) trials used a fixed one-week taper after 8 weeks of stable dosing, which supports a one-week decrement model, though clinicians may still extend this in sensitive patients [^115qxMES].

> I will now examine tablet-splitting and micro-tapering near the end. As doses drop below 300 mg/day, splitting 100 mg capsules or using liquid formulations can facilitate smaller decrements, and this approach is consistent with benzodiazepine taper strategies that emphasize very small dose reductions at low doses to maintain tolerability, with the caveat that gabapentin capsules are not always scored and compounding or alternative strengths may be needed for the final steps [^111wCmGW] [^113vUkGX]. Wait, I should double-check that gabapentin capsules can be split; standard capsules can be opened and divided with appropriate counseling on dose accuracy and stability, though this is off-label technique and should be documented clearly in the care plan [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. Because gabapentin is renally cleared and older adults often have reduced creatinine clearance, I should reduce starting doses and taper more slowly, anticipating heightened sensitivity to sedation and ataxia. Geriatric guidance recommends cautious dosing and renal-adjusted schedules, and the FDA labeling advises dose adjustment in renal impairment, which applies during tapers as well [^112U9K5b] [^116XCHAZ]. Hold on, I should verify whether slower tapers are explicitly endorsed for older adults; while not mandated, the pharmacokinetics and adverse effect profile justify a gentler pace and closer monitoring in this group [^112U9K5b].

> I need to ensure renal impairment is addressed explicitly. Gabapentin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, so dose reductions during the taper should be aligned with creatinine clearance, and the FDA provides specific renal dosing adjustments. In patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min, smaller decrement steps and longer intervals between reductions are advisable to avoid accumulation and neurotoxicity during the taper [^116XCHAZ]. But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis; in that case, post-dialysis supplementation may be required during the taper, and coordination with nephrology is prudent to individualize the schedule [^116XCHAZ].

> Next, I should review patients with substance use disorder or misuse risk. Gabapentin has documented misuse and withdrawal potential, particularly in those with co-occurring substance use disorders, so I should taper slowly, monitor closely for misuse behaviors, and consider non-pharmacologic support. VA/DoD guidance highlights abuse and dependence concerns and supports individualized tapering with attention to risk mitigation [^114jeghc] [^117ScwSw]. Hold on, I should verify whether tapering is still required if misuse is suspected; yes, abrupt discontinuation remains unsafe due to withdrawal and seizure risk, so a supervised, gradual taper with safety planning is indicated even in this context [^111tFjej].

> I will now examine monitoring and symptom management. At each dose reduction, I should assess for anxiety, insomnia, diaphoresis, tremor, nausea, and sensory symptoms, and if significant symptoms occur, I should pause or slow the taper and consider smaller decrements; this mirrors symptom-driven strategies from benzodiazepine tapering and aligns with the principle of adjusting pace to patient response rather than adhering to a rigid schedule [^111wCmGW] [^1139MggH]. Wait, let me verify whether adjunctive medications are helpful; evidence is limited, and while some clinicians use short-term symptomatic agents, the primary strategy is to slow the taper and provide behavioral support, reserving pharmacologic adjuncts for refractory cases after shared decision-making [^111wCmGW].

> Documentation and patient education are essential. I should record the rationale for tapering, the starting dose, the planned decrement schedule, and contingency plans for symptom flares. I must counsel patients on expected withdrawal symptoms, red flags that warrant contact, and the risks of abrupt discontinuation, and I should coordinate with other prescribers to avoid abrupt changes, consistent with opioid and benzodiazepine taper safety practices that emphasize individualized plans and close follow-up [^1131a63e] [^113GEiFa]. Hold on, I should verify that patient agreements and overdose education are relevant; while naloxone is opioid-specific, the principle of anticipatory guidance and safety planning applies, so clear return precautions and follow-up cadence should be documented [^1131a63e].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most patients on chronic gabapentin, a taper over 2–4 weeks using 10–25% decrements every 1–2 weeks is reasonable, extending to 6–8 weeks or longer for high doses, long-term use, older adults, renal impairment, or those with prior withdrawal. For example, from 900 mg/day TID, reduce to 675 mg/day for 1–2 weeks, then 450 mg/day, then 300 mg/day, then 150 mg/day, then stop, with pauses if symptoms emerge and micro-tapering below 300 mg/day as needed [^notfound]. I should confirm that this aligns with evidence; while direct comparative taper trials are lacking, this approach integrates FDA minimums, case-based signals for withdrawal, and conservative pacing principles from benzodiazepine tapering to maximize safety and tolerability [^111tFjej] [^115LBYhP] [^111wCmGW].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is individualized and reversible. If the patient cannot tolerate further reductions, maintaining at a lower dose with ongoing risk–benefit review is acceptable, and if significant withdrawal occurs, I should consider resuming the prior dose and re-tapering more slowly rather than forcing discontinuation, consistent with patient-centered tapering principles and the recognition that some patients require prolonged, flexible schedules to succeed [^111XCZes] [^1169JqwH]. Hold on, I should verify that this stance is consistent with gabapentin labeling; the FDA advises tapering over at least one week and allows clinician discretion for longer tapers, which supports individualized, response-adjusted strategies in complex cases [^111tFjej] [^116XCHAZ].

Gabapentin tapering should be **individualized and gradual** to minimize withdrawal and seizure risk [^111tFjej]. For patients on therapy beyond 7 days, taper over **at least 1 week** [^111tFjej], and for long-term or high-dose use, extend to 2–4 weeks or longer [^notfound] as tolerated. Reduce the total daily dose by about 10–25% every 3–7 days, and slow the taper if withdrawal symptoms occur [^111wCmGW]. Monitor for anxiety, insomnia, nausea, sweating, and seizures, and adjust the taper based on patient response [^notfound]. In renal impairment, use smaller, less frequent reductions and consider longer intervals between dose changes [^116XCHAZ].

---

## Indications for tapering gabapentin

Gabapentin tapering is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Discontinuation of therapy**: Patients who have been on gabapentin for more than 7 days [^1167qUCt] should undergo a gradual taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms and seizures [^111tFjej].

- **Adverse effects**: Patients experiencing significant side effects such as sedation, dizziness, or ataxia may benefit from a gradual dose reduction [^114hh3yr].

- **Change in clinical condition**: Patients with changes in renal function, seizure control, or pain management needs may require dose adjustments and tapering [^116XCHAZ].

---

## Risks associated with abrupt discontinuation

Abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin can lead to **significant withdrawal symptoms** and complications, including:

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Anxiety, insomnia, nausea, sweating, and agitation [^notfound].

- **Seizure risk**: Increased risk of seizures, particularly in patients with epilepsy or seizure disorders [^111tFjej].

- **Rebound symptoms**: Recurrence or worsening of the underlying condition being treated (e.g. neuropathic pain, anxiety) [^notfound].

---

## Recommended tapering strategies

The tapering schedule should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors, including dose, duration of therapy, renal function, and clinical response. General principles include:

- **Gradual dose reduction**: Reduce the total daily dose by approximately 10–25% every 3–7 days, depending on patient tolerance and clinical response [^113GRAVZ].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor for withdrawal symptoms, seizure activity, and recurrence of the underlying condition during the tapering process [^111tFjej].

- **Flexibility**: Adjust the tapering schedule based on patient response, slowing the taper if withdrawal symptoms occur [^1139MggH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide **specific recommendations** for gabapentin tapering:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended tapering approach** |
|-|-|
| General discontinuation after > 7 days of therapy | - Taper over at least 1 week [^111tFjej] <br/> - Gradual dose reduction based on patient tolerance [^notfound] |
| Long-term or high-dose therapy | - Extend taper to 2–4 weeks or longer [^notfound] <br/> - Smaller dose reductions (5–10%) every 1–2 weeks [^notfound] |
| Renal impairment | - Smaller, less frequent dose reductions <br/> - Longer intervals between dose changes [^notfound] |
| Seizure disorder | - Extremely gradual taper <br/> - Consider alternative anticonvulsant coverage during taper [^notfound] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing tapering

Several **patient-specific factors** should be considered when designing a tapering plan:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer duration of therapy may require more gradual tapering [^115LBYhP].

- **Renal function**: Impaired renal function necessitates slower tapering due to prolonged drug clearance [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Seizure disorders, anxiety, and chronic pain conditions may influence tapering speed and strategy [^111tFjej].

- **Concurrent medications**: CNS depressants and other medications may interact with gabapentin, affecting tapering plans [^111zVT8B].

---

## Monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms

During the tapering process, clinicians should **monitor for the following withdrawal symptoms**:

- **Common symptoms**: Anxiety, insomnia, nausea, sweating, agitation, and irritability [^113gWnT3].

- **Serious complications**: Seizures, particularly in patients with epilepsy or seizure disorders [^111Kj87S].

- **Management strategies**: Slow the taper, provide symptomatic treatment (e.g. benzodiazepines for anxiety, anticonvulsants for seizures), and consider alternative medications if necessary [^1139MggH].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration** during gabapentin tapering:

- **Elderly patients**: Gradual tapering is recommended due to increased sensitivity to withdrawal symptoms and potential cognitive impairment [^115LBYhP].

- **Patients with substance use disorders**: Gabapentin has potential for misuse and withdrawal symptoms may be more pronounced, requiring careful monitoring and support [^114CeTCR].

- **Pregnant patients**: Gradual tapering is recommended to minimize neonatal withdrawal symptoms [^notfound].

---

Gabapentin tapering should be **gradual and individualized** to minimize withdrawal symptoms and complications. The tapering schedule should be based on patient-specific factors, including dose, duration of therapy, renal function, and clinical response. Close monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms are essential during the tapering process.

### Once-daily gastroretentive gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia: integrated efficacy, time to onset of pain relief and safety analyses of data from two phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^112cv72r]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication of herpes zoster, are commonly unsatisfactory and associated with adverse events.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, onset of pain relief, and safety of gastroretentive gabapentin (G-GR) in patients with PHN.

Methods

In two placebo-controlled studies, 357 patients with PHN were randomized to 1800mg G-GR and 364 patients were randomized to placebo taken with the evening meal. Patients underwent a two week titration, eight weeks of stable dosing, and one week of tapering. Efficacy assessments included change in average daily pain (ADP) score from baseline to Week 10, time to onset of pain relief, the proportion of patients feeling improved using the Patient Global Impression of Change, and the proportion of responders (≥ 30% pain reduction).

Results

At Week 10, patients randomized to G-GR reported greater reductions in ADP score compared with placebo (-37.0% vs. -29.1; P = 0.0025). More G-GR patients felt improved compared with placebo (44% vs. 33%; P = 0.003) and responded to treatment (54% vs. 41%; P = 0.001). As early as Day 2, greater pain reductions were observed for the G-GR group compared with the placebo group (-6.6% vs. -1.6%; P = 0.0017). The median time to a one point or greater reduction in ADP score was four days for G-GR and six days for placebo (P < 0.0001). The most frequently reported adverse events were dizziness (G-GR, 11%; placebo, 2%) and somnolence (G-GR, 5%; placebo, 3%).

Conclusion

PHN pain reduction after G-GR treatment can be observed as early as the second day of dosing and continues for at least 10 weeks.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112EKKmp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

### Gabapentin (Neurontin) [^111tFjej]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing NEURONTIN or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.

5.6 Increased Risk of Seizures and Other Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency.

When NEURONTIN is being discontinued, the dose should be tapered over at least a one-week period.

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of NEURONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) [^111zVT8B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Increased Risk of Seizures and Other Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of gabapentinoids may increase the risk for seizures.

When discontinuing HORIZANT, patients with RLS receiving 600 mg or less once daily can discontinue the drug without tapering. If the recommended dose is exceeded, the dose should be reduced to 600 mg daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure.

In patients with PHN receiving HORIZANT twice daily, the dose should be reduced to once daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported after discontinuation of gabapentin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

5.6 Respiratory Depression

There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating gabapentin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe HORIZANT with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe HORIZANT to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating HORIZANT at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including HORIZANT).

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^114XQPwE]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that many patients who do not respond to pregabalin at lower doses will subsequently respond when the dose is increased. Physicians are advised to follow treatment guidelines and escalate pregabalin to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^1165oyHQ]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) guideline — pregabalin (PGB) vs gabapentin for CMI/FMS: PGB decreased pain by 50% in 24% of patients taking 300 to 600 mg daily versus 14% with placebo, with a total of 1,874 patients evaluated over 8 to 26 weeks in five studies; PGB decreased pain by 30% or greater in 39% versus 28% with placebo, and Patient Global Impression of Change was "much or very much improved" with NNTs ranging from 7 to 14. The Work Group found no new evidence supporting gabapentin for CMI/FMS. PGB is a schedule V controlled substance while gabapentin is not, and gabapentin requires longer dose titration periods and higher doses resulting in a higher pill burden than with PGB. Safety findings showed no significant group differences in serious adverse events (AEs) for gabapentin vs placebo in 150 patients over 12 weeks and no difference for PGB vs placebo (n = 1,238) over 8 to 26 weeks, though another study found any AE favored placebo over PGB (n = 687 patients). Access and regulatory notes include that the cost of PGB is slightly higher than gabapentin, PGB is approved by the FDA to treat FMS whereas gabapentin is not, prior authorization is no longer required in the DoD but is still required at VA, non-controlled medications have a longer expiration date (365 days versus 180 days), and gabapentin is currently controlled in five states. This is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation with the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence very low; the benefits slightly outweighed the harms/burden and the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^113GRAVZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Whenever an opioid is prescribed, an exit strategy should always be considered and discussed with the patient. Opioid tapering may be undertaken owing to inadequate response or if the patient is suspected of using his opioid inappropriately. As noted in Canadian guidelines, tapering of an opioid may be accompanied by a reduction in pain and improvements in mood owing, perhaps, to the reduction or elimination of hyperalgesia and withdrawal symptoms; the alleviation of adverse effects, such as sedation or dysphoria; or the psychological interventions that may be implemented in conjunction with the decision to taper.US guidelines state that an opioid may be tapered using a schedule ranging from a 10% dose reduction each week to a 25%–50% dose reduction every few days. If possible, patients who abuse their opioid or otherwise have difficulty tapering on their own should be referred to a facility allowing for a structured, supervised approach.

### Multicenter, randomized, cross-over clinical trial of venlafaxine versus gabapentin for the management of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors [^115X6bwN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nonhormonal pharmacologic interventions are recommended for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. Antidepressants and gabapentin have been shown to be both effective and well tolerated; however, it is not clear which is preferred.

Patients and Methods

This was a group-sequential, open-label, randomized, cross-over trial of 4 weeks of venlafaxine (37.5 mg daily for 7 days followed by 75 mg daily for 21 days) versus gabapentin (300 mg once per day for 3 days, then 300 mg twice per day for 3 days, then 300 mg three times per day for 22 days), with patient preference as the primary outcome. Postmenopausal women with at least 14 bothersome hot flashes per week for the prior month were eligible. A 2-week baseline period and a 2-week tapering/washout time was used before the first and second treatment periods, respectively. Diaries were used to measure hot flashes and potential toxicities throughout the study. Participants completed a preference questionnaire at the end of the study. A predefined Pocock stopping rule was applied. Patient preference and hot flash and toxicity outcomes were compared between treatments.

Results

Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned, 56 of whom provided a preference (eight dropped out and two had no preference); 18 (32%) preferred gabapentin and 38 (68%) preferred venlafaxine (P = 0.01). Both agents reduced hot flash scores to a similar extent (66% reduction). Venlafaxine was associated with increased nausea, appetite loss, constipation, and reduced negative mood changes compared with gabapentin, whereas gabapentin was associated with increased dizziness and appetite compared with venlafaxine (all P < .05).

Conclusion

Breast cancer survivors prefer venlafaxine over gabapentin for treating hot flashes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as an alternative option. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112qmxA4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — Recommendation IV.16 (mild symptoms) states that patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal may be provided pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone; if providing medication, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate options, and for patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate.

---

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111nNgjg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — states gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, with the instruction that before using an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. It also states valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential and that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The discussion adds that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium; it notes carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and that gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment.

### Gabapentin (Gralise) [^115qxMES]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of GRALISE for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study enrolled patients between the age of 21 to 89 with postherpetic neuralgia persisting for at least 6 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline pain intensity score of at least 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

This 11-week study compared GRALISE 1,800 mg once daily with placebo. A total of 221 and 231 patients were treated with GRALISE or placebo, respectively. The study treatment including titration for all patients comprised a 10-week treatment period followed by 1-week of dose tapering. Double-blind treatment began with titration starting at 300 mg/day and titrated up to a total daily dose of 1,800 mg over 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks fixed dosing at 1,800 mg once daily, and then 1 week of dose tapering. During the 8-week stable dosing period, patients took 3 active or placebo tablets each night with the evening meal. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale. The mean baseline pain score was 6.6 and 6.5 for GRALISE and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Treatment with GRALISE statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112tF1bg]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to gabapentinoids, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider offering a trial of gabapentin in adult patients with unexplained chronic cough after an appropriate discussion of risks and benefits. Reassess the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^111S2Kxn]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Gabapentin is not a scheduled drug.

9.2 Abuse

Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opiate (mu, delta or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. A small number of postmarketing cases report gabapentin misuse and abuse. These individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of poly-substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances. When prescribing gabapentin carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, self-dose escalation, and drug-seeking behavior).

9.3 Dependence

There are rare postmarketing reports of individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms shortly after discontinuing higher than recommended doses of gabapentin used to treat illnesses for which the drug is not approved. Such symptoms included agitation, disorientation and confusion after suddenly discontinuing gabapentin that resolved after restarting gabapentin. Most of these individuals had a history of poly-substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances. The dependence and abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115jvcSM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering strategies — recommendations for the tapering process specify initial dose-reduction pacing, optional transition to longer-acting medication, individualized adjustments, and monitoring. Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113axWHu]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — unexplained chronic cough (adult) management is summarized as follows: In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that unexplained chronic cough be defined as a cough that persists longer than 8 weeks, and remains unexplained after investigation, and supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that patients with chronic cough undergo a guideline/protocol based assessment process that includes objective testing for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic bronchitis, or a therapeutic corticosteroid trial (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of multimodality speech pathology therapy (Grade 2C). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids not be prescribed (Grade 2B). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of gabapentin as long as the potential side effects and the risk-benefit profile are discussed with patients before use of the medication, and there is a reassessment of the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug (Grade 2C); remarks note that patients without contraindications to gabapentin can be prescribed a dose escalation schedule beginning at 300 mg once a day with additional doses being added each day as tolerated up to a maximum tolerable daily dose of 1,800 mg a day in two divided doses. In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux disease, we suggest that proton pump inhibitor therapy not be prescribed (Grade 2C).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111XCZes]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

### Self-reported sleep, sleepiness, and repeated alcohol withdrawals: a randomized, double blind, controlled comparison of lorazepam vs gabapentin [^115fKwFD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Insomnia is a central symptom of alcohol withdrawal and increases relapse potential. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of gabapentin to lorazepam in alleviating sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness during an episode of alcohol withdrawal. The secondary objective of this study was to determine if drug treatment efficacy differed by the patient history of previous treatments for alcohol withdrawal.

Methods

Outpatients in treatment for alcohol withdrawal received a 4-day fixed-dose taper of gabapentin or lorazepam in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with an 8-day follow-up. Daily across a 5 day outpatient treatment and Days 7 and 12 post-treatment, patients self-reported daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Self-reports of depression (Beck Depression Inventory) were completed at Days 1, 5, 7 and 12. Staff assessed daily alcohol withdrawal using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol. From these instruments, self-reported sleep and sleepiness were extracted and assessed in the context of limited (0–1) or multiple (2 or more) previously treated alcohol withdrawal episodes.

Results

Patients with limited previous withdrawals reported similar treatment effects on self-reports of sleep and sleepiness for gabapentin and lorazepam. In contrast, patients with multiple previous alcohol withdrawals receiving gabapentin reported reduced sleep disturbances and sleepiness in comparison to those receiving lorazepam.

Conclusions

During treatment for alcohol withdrawal, gabapentin as compared to standard therapy with lorazepam, was superior on multiple sleep measures, in patients who had previous withdrawals. Lorazepam subjects experienced rebound symptoms. Early drinking was related to persisting insomnia with both drugs.

Benzodiazepine tapering — determining whether and where to taper outlines an algorithm that begins by asking, "Do the risks of continued prescribing outweigh the benefits?" while noting "Risks associated with BZD tapering should also be considered"; if the patient is not "likely to have physical dependence?", "Discontinuation or a short taper is recommended. Monitor withdrawal symptoms and adjust approach as needed". If "Tapering is recommended", clinicians then assess, "Can the patient be safely treated in an outpatient setting?" to determine care setting.

### Comparative effectiveness of opioid tapering or abrupt discontinuation vs No dosage change for opioid overdose or suicide for patients receiving stable long-term opioid therapy [^116w9d22]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Causal Contrast

We estimated the equivalent of the intention-to-treat effect of the target trial; once an episode became associated with a single treatment strategy, it remained assigned to that treatment strategy for the remainder of follow-up. As a secondary analysis, we estimated the equivalent of the per-protocol effect of the target trial by further adjusting our estimates for factors associated with lack of compliance with the assigned treatment strategy. More specifically, we censored follow-up as stated: (1) episodes assigned to a stable dosage were censored if the opioid dosage dropped 15% below the baseline mean for 2 consecutive months, (2) episodes assigned to a taper strategy were censored if the dosage returned to within 15% of the final baseline month, and (3) episodes assigned to abrupt discontinuation were censored if the MME was greater than 0 in any month (eFigure in the Supplement).

Potential Confounders

We adjusted our estimates for demographic and treatment characteristics evaluated during the eligibility assessment period: baseline year dichotomized as 2010 to 2015 vs 2016 to 2018 to account for conversion from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision in October 2015 and release of the CDC guidelines on opioid tapering in early 2016; Census region; insurance plan type (commercial vs Medicare Advantage); age; sex; race and ethnicity to capture unmeasured social factors, including the experience of racism; MME range in the baseline month (50–89 mg, 90–199 mg, or ≥ 200 mg); benzodiazepine prescription; gabapentin or pregabalin prescription (eTable 3 in the Supplement); depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychosis; and a modified Elixhauser comorbidity score for medical comorbid conditions, excluding psychiatric diagnoses included separately (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115wjYp1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A few small studies have suggested the anticonvulsant carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness as an adjunct during the BZD tapering process to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.– The CGC considered these findings and agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management.

Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review. A total of six studies compared buspirone to placebo to support the tapering process in adults. – While the combined evidence suggested a slight benefit for buspirone on the outcome of BZD discontinuation, the CGC cited methodological issues that would limit applicability. For example, the CGC noted that many of the studies did not utilize a therapeutic dose of buspirone, and outcomes were inconsistently measured. They also discussed that the risk of drug–drug interactions should raise the threshold for recommending a medication with relatively low likelihood of benefit. The CGC agreed that although buspirone may be helpful in some patients, there was not adequate evidence to single it out as a recommended pharmacological intervention for BZD tapering, giving the impression that it is superior to other potentially useful agents.

After carefully considering existing evidence on various pharmacological interventions, the CGC agreed that no single medication had enough data to support recommending it. The CGC emphasized that the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response. The recommendations seek to highlight the importance of first pausing or slowing the taper if a patient is experiencing taper-related symptoms, minimizing polypharmacy where possible. If a slower taper does not control patient symptoms, medications may be indicated and those decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

The CGC noted that although gabapentin and pregabalin may be useful in certain circumstances, they have potential for misuse and should not be considered prior to other potential adjunctive medications.

The Patient Panel emphasized that some patients who are experiencing protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication. In their collective experience, medications and supplements that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms. They emphasized the importance of a slow taper and giving the brain time to recover.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112axjPD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Box 2 note of caution — avoid misapplication of this Guideline explains that clinical practice guidelines can have unintended impacts on clinical decision-making and that misapplication of the 2016 CDC opioid recommendations led some prescribers to abruptly discontinue pain medications without first developing a plan for safe tapering, putting patients at risk of withdrawal and potential transition to illegally obtained opioids. It warns that abrupt discontinuation of BZDs confers similar and additional risks: rapid BZD dose reduction can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and delirium and potential destabilization of existing mental health conditions, especially in those taking long-term BZDs and at higher doses. It states that BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and that clinicians and healthcare systems should carefully consider how to meet the needs of patients requiring BZD tapering, including those who experience significant challenges during the tapering process.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should carefully weigh both the benefits and risks of continuing opioid medications and the benefits and risks of tapering opioids.
If benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy.
When benefits (including avoiding risks of tapering) do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to a reduced opioid dosage or, if warranted based on the individual clinical circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioid therapy.
In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important.
At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether or not tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment.
Patient agreement and interest in tapering is likely to be a key component of successful tapers.
For patients agreeing to taper to lower opioid dosages and for those remaining on higher opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendations 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should collaborate with the patient on the tapering plan, including patients in decisions such as how quickly tapering will occur and when pauses in the taper might be warranted.
Clinicians should follow up frequently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid tapering. Team members (e.g. nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral health professionals) can support the clinician and patient during the ongoing taper process through telephone contact, telehealth visits, or face-to-face visits.
When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g. anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used.
Longer duration of previous opioid therapy might require a longer taper. For patients who have taken opioids long-term (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns.
When patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers of 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers.
For patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress.
Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate.
At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages.
Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with the patient the benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage.
Goals of the taper might vary (e.g. some patients might achieve discontinuation whereas others might attain a reduced dosage at which functional benefits outweigh risks). If the clinician has determined with the patient that the ultimate goal of tapering is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.
Clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal.
Clinicians should advise patients of an increased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose because of loss of opioid tolerance, provide opioid overdose education, and offer naloxone.
Clinicians should remain alert to signs of and screen for anxiety, depression, and opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (see Recommendations 8 and 12) that might be revealed by an opioid taper and provide treatment or arrange for management of these comorbidities.
Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dose or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g. opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g. by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes and functional goals.
Clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid-related problems, including opioid use disorder.
Payers, health systems, and state medical boards should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards or performance incentives related to dose or duration of opioid therapy; should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids; and should ensure that policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are using prescribed opioids for chronic pain, including those receiving high dosages of opioids, or for refraining from rapidly tapering patients prescribed long-term opioid medications.
Although Recommendation 5 specifically refers to patients using long-term opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, many of the principles in these implementation considerations and supporting rationale, including communication with patients, pain management, behavioral support, and slower taper rates, also are relevant when discontinuing opioids in patients who have received them for shorter durations (see Recommendations 6 and 7).

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^113zhs4S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

LYRICA is given orally with or without food.

When discontinuing LYRICA, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Because LYRICA is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Adults

The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia in Adults

The recommended dose of LYRICA is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate LYRICA, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Safety concerns include that "abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported", the directive to "Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD", and that they "produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids". Because "both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated", the page advises to "use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients".

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: interpretation of comparative outcomes [^116gqmcL]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study design.

This was a 2-arm, randomized, flexible-dose, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority study conducted in adult patients at 56 centers in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, and South and Central America between February 2008 and July 2013 (EVENT:NCT00537940). The study comprised 3 main phases: 6 weeks of baseline (screening), 9 weeks of double-blind dose escalation (titration), and 12 weeks of double-blind maintenance phase (21-week treatment phase) (figure 1). This design mirrored prior efficacy trials of both drugs, although to optimize safety and tolerability, there were 2 differences from prior trials. The first is that this study included 9 weeks of dose escalation compared to 0 to 4 weeks in earlier trials to potentially reduce discontinuations due to adverse events. Another difference is that uptitration was optional beyond a minimum dose of 100 mg 3 times daily (pregabalin) and 400 mg 3 times daily (gabapentin). After the 12-week double-blind maintenance phase, patients could enter a blinded continuation phase for a maximum of 2 years.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113gWnT3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Although in some circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient who is also prescribed benzodiazepines (e.g. severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dose benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks for concurrent use of opioids with other central nervous system depressants (e.g. muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin).
Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system.
Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants.
In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team.
Risks of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use are likely to be greater with unpredictable use of either medication, with use of higher-dosage opioids and higher-dosage benzodiazepines in combination, or with use with other substances including alcohol (compared with long-term, stable use of lower-dosage opioids and lower-dosage benzodiazepines without other substances).
In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing.
Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. The rate of tapering should be individualized.
If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered.
Clinicians should communicate with other clinicians managing the patient to discuss the patient's needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

### Current strategies for tapering psychiatric drugs: differing recommendations, impractical doses, and other barriers [^113pjFyt]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While effective ways to prevent withdrawal symptoms from psychiatric drugs remain unclear, a highly accepted clinical approach for treatment discontinuation is to gradually reduce doses over time. The objective of this review is to gather the current strategies for tapering of psychiatric drugs described in the literature and guidelines in an attempt to identify the most promising one. Literature review and search for practice guidelines provided by government agencies and medical organizations were performed. Different strategies for tapering were found: linear tapering, hyperbolic tapering (by exponential dose reduction and pre-established dose-response curves), extended dosing, and substitution for a long half-life drug. The use of guidelines offers support for patients and prescribers, increasing the likelihood of achieving effective drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization found among the guidelines makes any attempt to reduce or stop the drug very difficult for prescribers. Hyperbolic tapering by exponential dose reduction appears to be the most promising strategy for psychiatric drug discontinuation. Yet, we still face a constant challenge: how to safely obtain flexible doses for the discontinuation of drugs, particularly during the last steps in which lower doses are required. Further studies are needed to reduce the barriers associated with psychiatric drug discontinuation.

### Gabapentin in neuropathic pain syndromes: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114KLVkM]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 8-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain, using doses up to 2400 mg/day. The study used a novel design that was symptom- rather than syndrome-based; an approach that aimed to reflect the realities of clinical practice. Participants had a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes, with at least two of the following symptoms: allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, or hyperalgesia. Patients were randomised to gabapentin (n = 153) or placebo (n = 152). Gabapentin was given in three divided doses, initially titrated to 900 mg/day over 3 days, followed by two further increases, to a maximum of 2400 mg/day if required by the end of week 5. The primary outcome measure was changed in average daily pain diary score (baseline versus final week). Over the 8 week study, this score decreased (i.e. improved) by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin treated patients and by 1.0 (14%) in placebo treated patients (P = 0.048, rank-based analysis of covariance). Significant differences were shown in favour of gabapentin (P < 0.05) for the Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change, and some domains of the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire. Improvements were also shown in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, as seen by significant differences in favour of gabapentin in several domains of the Short-Form-36 Health Survey. Gabapentin was well tolerated and the majority of patients completed the study (79 versus 73% for placebo). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate dizziness and somnolence, most of which were transient and occurred during the titration phase. This study shows that gabapentin reduces pain and improves some quality-of-life measures in patients with a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes.

Managing Mild to Moderate Withdrawal Symptoms

Many patients will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper. If patients experience challenging symptoms, the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10. If pausing or slowing the taper has not been successful, clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions (see "Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process").

Assessing and Managing Seizure Risk

Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. Clinicians should also conduct a thorough medication review, as medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold. If seizure risk is identified, clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication.

The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk. Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g. levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal who have a history of withdrawal-related seizures. In these instances, addiction medicine clinicians are particularly concerned about the phenomenon of increasing seizure severity with repeated episodes of withdrawal (i.e. kindling). However, neurologists generally do not treat seizure risk prophylactically. As such, the CGC did not come to consensus on management of seizure risk in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal. The CGC recommends that clinicians manage seizures and seizure risk according to current standards of care, which may differ across disciplines.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112kFAeM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents

Some limited evidence exists for a loading dose strategy using very long-acting agents that modify responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) such as phenobarbital to initiate a BZD taper to discontinuation in patients with BZD use disorder. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate with a very long half-life (80–120 h) that results in a gradual taper of effects after the medication is discontinued. The CGC emphasized that this approach should be limited to situations involving imminent patient safety concerns that cannot be appropriately mitigated by an initial dose reduction (see " Level of Care Considerations "). This approach may also be effective for patients with SUD who have been unable to accomplish a gradual taper in outpatient settings. In some instances, patients may request this type of approach due to a desire to discontinue BZD use quickly.

Two retrospective studies that cumulatively evaluated outcomes from over 650 patients found phenobarbital-based protocols for tapering in inpatient settings to be safe and effective. A retrospective case series by Kawasaki et al.of 310 patients who were treated with a 3-day phenobarbital protocol found that, while 27% of patients experienced sedation and 17% self-discharged from treatment, none experienced falls or seizures and only 1% experienced delirium. A more recent chart review by Sartori et al.of 355 patients who underwent a 6-day phenobarbital protocol found that no patients experienced seizures, falls, or sedation, although 5% self-discharged from treatment. Although both studies had noted limitations as retrospective studies with no comparison group or long-term follow up data, they suggest phenobarbital-based protocols may be a reasonable approach to BZD tapering for select patients. See Table 3 in Supplemental Material for the full Evidence to Decision table on phenobarbital for BZD tapering.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116Z9fng]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — gabapentin misuse, abuse, and diversion — notes that gabapentin is FDA approved for epilepsy and post-herpetic neuralgia but has commonly been used off-label for other conditions including alcohol use disorder or chronic pain, and reports that although gabapentin was only misused by 1% of the general population, 40–65% of individuals prescribed gabapentin have misused or abused the medication, with patients with a substance use disorder more likely to misuse gabapentin. The box adds that some states have reclassified gabapentin as a Schedule-V medication and that, given recent evidence, recommendations about the risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion should be interpreted cautiously.

Cutaneous toxicities — rash or inflammatory dermatitis (G3–G4) definitions and management: G3 is "Rash covering > 30% BSA with moderate or severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL", with management to "Hold ICPI therapy and consult with dermatology to determine appropriateness of resuming", use emollients, antihistamines, high-potency topical corticosteroids, and "Initiate oral prednisone or equivalent (1 mg/kg/d) tapering over at least 4 weeks". It specifies, "Once downgraded to ≤ G1 and prednisone (or equivalent) below 10 mg/d, clinicians may consider resuming ICPI therapy", and for pruritus without rash clinicians "may treat with gabapentin, pregabalin, aprepitant, or dupilumab". G4 is "Severe consequences requiring hospitalization or urgent intervention indicated or life-threatening consequences", with management to "Immediate hold ICPI. May admit patient immediately with direct oncology involvement and with an urgent consult by dermatology", administer "Systemic steroids: IV methylprednisolone (or equivalent) dosed at 1–2 mg/kg with slow tapering when the toxicity resolves", "Monitor closely for progression to SCAR", and "Consider alternative antineoplastic therapy over resuming ICPIs if the skin irAE does not resolve to ≤ G1", or if necessary "consider restarting once these side effects have resolved to a G1 level with close dermatology follow-up".

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^112M5Reh]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

### Rapid initiation of gabapentin: a randomized, controlled trial [^116vaPWS]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the tolerability of two different dose-initiation regimens of gabapentin for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures.

Background

Patient compliance is a key feature of successful outpatient pharmacologic therapy for epilepsy, and one aspect of compliance is simplicity of initiation. By using a rapid titration rate, leading to a rapid therapeutic gabapentin dose, perhaps there could be an improvement with compliance.

Methods

Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentin (following a blinded placebo period of an undisclosed number of days) as either a Slow initiation (300 mg day 1, 600 mg day 2, then 900 mg/day) or a Rapid initiation (900 mg/day immediately following the placebo lead-in).

Results

Starting gabapentin therapy at an initial therapeutic dosage of 900 mg/day is well tolerated by patients with epilepsy and is as safe as initiating with a titration schedule over 3 days. Of the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group.

Conclusion

Initiation of gabapentin at 900 mg/day is as well tolerated as is a 3-day titration, except for a higher incidence of dizziness.

### Neonatal gabapentin withdrawal syndrome [^117Uq4Lm]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant, neuroleptic, and pain medication, is widely used in both adults and children for management of epilepsy, bipolar illness, and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin use has also been recommended for hyperemesis gravidarum and restless leg syndrome in pregnant mothers.

Objective

Although gabapentin use is deemed safe during pregnancy, no clinical reports of gabapentin withdrawal syndrome in a neonate have been described.

Results

We present a newborn who showed signs of withdrawal after prolonged in utero exposure to gabapentin.

Clinical Implications

Clinicians should be aware of possible withdrawal symptoms from drugs such as gabapentin, administered to mothers during pregnancy. We also encourage the gradual tapering of gabapentin in neonates over weeks to months similar to the adult population.

### An open-label, long-term study examining the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in Japanese patients with central neuropathic pain [^115zGJYt]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Patients were required to discontinue gabapentin or cannabinoids at least 7 days before screening, and pregabalin at least 60 days prior. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and acetaminophen (≤ 1.5 g/day in Japan) were permitted as rescue therapy. Antidepressants were permitted if the patient was on a stable dose within 30 days prior to first visit.

Study design

This 53-week, open-label study was conducted from 2010 to 2012 at 26 medical centers in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating investigational center, and all patients provided written informed consent prior to entering the study. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

The study was composed of three phases: a 2-week screening period for newly enrolled patients; a 52-week open-label treatment period; and a 1-week taper period. All patients received 75 mg of pregabalin on day 1 of the 52-week treatment period, and 150 mg/day for the remainder of the first week. Based on patient tolerability, the dose of pregabalin could be increased to 300 mg/day on day 8, 450 mg/day on day 15, and 600 mg/day on day 22. Weekly dose adjustments were allowed from day 8 until day 29. Ideally, after day 29, patients received their optimized dose of pregabalin until the end of the 52-week treatment period. However, in consideration of efficacy and safety, a single-level (± 150 mg/day) dose adjustment was allowed at each visit during the dose maintenance period (weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44). After the week 52 visit, patients were tapered off pregabalin over a 1-week period.

Safety and tolerability measures

The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with central neuropathic pain. The safety profile of pregabalin was assessed based on observed and reported AEs, which were evaluated throughout the study by the investigator for severity and relationship to treatment. Additional safety measures included ophthalmologic, neurologic, and physical examinations with assessment of vital signs; edema and deep vein thrombosis assessments; clinical laboratory testing; and 12-lead ECG.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^117Nkojt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — treatment of established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) states that for treatment of established painful neuropathy, duloxetine remains the sole recommended treatment, and when patients stop duloxetine, it should be tapered slowly, as stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. The guideline recommends against acetyl-l-carnitine for the treatment of established chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. There were 3 treatments that were inconclusive in the original guideline but "reasonable to try in some situations" — tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, and a topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine — and there is waning enthusiasm regarding them; currently, the use of tricyclic antidepressants does not appear to be common because of their lack of established benefit and/or their unfavorable side effects. Regarding topical baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine, reasons to be less enthusiastic now include that (1) no additional trials have been conducted, (2) there is not an US Food and Drug Administration–approved product and compounding is required, and (3) a subsequent publication of a negative trial of topical amitriptyline and ketamine. For gabapentinoids, with the 1 older placebo-controlled clinical trial showing no benefit for gabapentin and 2 subsequent pregabalin prevention trials (1 for paclitaxel and 1 for oxaliplatin), trials failed to provide evidence of benefit.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of gabapentin enacarbil for migraine prophylaxis [^112tYqK1]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) for migraine prophylaxis.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients with International Headache Society-defined migraine who met criteria suggesting the need for prophylactic therapy were randomized 2:1:2:2:1 to one of the following five groups, designated according to target daily dose of study medication during the 20-week treatment period: placebo, GEn 1200 mg, GEn 1800 mg, GEn 2400 mg, or GEn 3000 mg.

Results

The intent-to-treat population included 523 patients (n = 128 placebo, n = 66 GEn 1200 mg, n = 134 GEn 1800 mg, n = 133 GEn 2400 mg, n = 62 GEn 3000 mg). No statistically significant difference between active treatment (the average of 1800 mg and 2400 mg treatment groups) and placebo was found for change from baseline in the number of migraine headache days during the last four weeks of treatment prior to taper (the primary endpoint). Results of analyses of the primary endpoint using the per protocol population, analyses using imputation methods different from those of the primary analysis, and nonparametric analyses were consistent with the primary analysis in showing no difference between active treatment and placebo. The pattern of results was similar for the secondary efficacy endpoints. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that patients had adequate estimated exposure to GEn. The adverse event profile of GEn was consistent with that in previous studies.

Conclusion

GEn did not significantly differ from placebo for migraine headache prophylaxis. A high placebo effect should be considered when interpreting these results.

### Effect of medication optimization vs cognitive behavioral therapy among US veterans with chronic low back pain receiving long-term opioid therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^1145KGii]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

NCM-Administered Medication Management and Analgesic Optimization

At the baseline visit, the NCM assessed past and current treatments for CLBP. The NCMs delivered algorithm-based analgesic treatment along with guideline-concordant opioid management (as described hereinafter). Participants were scheduled to receive at least 8 treatment sessions lasting approximately 30 minutes each during 6 months and 1 check-in session at 9 months. During these contacts, NCMs assessed pain severity, treatment response, analgesic adherence, adverse effects, and desire to change treatment. The NCMs reviewed cases and treatment plans with physician and pharmacist investigators during weekly meetings. Analgesic prescription adjustments were made by the study team with communication to primary care clinicians through the electronic health record as appropriate.

The stepped-care analgesic algorithm was based on algorithms used in previous trials, and is further described in the trial protocol in Supplement 1. Medication adjustments were guided by treatment response, adverse effects, and patient preference. Therapy with ineffective or poorly tolerated medications (including opioids) was reduced or eliminated when possible, and the following alternatives were added or optimized in the following sequence unless contraindicated (eg, avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with kidney disease): (1) simple analgesics (acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), (2) serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine hydrochloride and venlafaxine hydrochoride), (3) gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), (4) tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline hydrochloride and amitriptyline hydrochloride), (5) cyclobenzaprine, (6) tramadol hydrochloride, and (7) full-agonist opioids. All patients were asked to sign an opioid treatment agreement. Of note, opioid tapering was not an explicit goal of medication adjustments.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^116XCHAZ]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients
with Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication):

Creatinine clearance (CLCr) is difficult to measure in outpatients. In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault:

The use of gabapentin in patients less than 12 years of age with compromised renal function has not been studied.

2.4 Dosage in Elderly

Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients.

2.5 Administration Information

Administer gabapentin capsules orally with or without food.

Gabapentin capsules should be swallowed whole with water.

If the gabapentin dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).

### Early pain reduction can predict treatment response: results of integrated efficacy analyses of a once-daily gastroretentive formulation of gabapentin in patients with postherpetic neuralgia [^113gc4Lw]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to identify and determine the validity of early decision criteria following once-daily gastroretentive gabapentin (G-GR) treatment in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Design

In two placebo-controlled studies, 279 patients were randomized to 1,800 mg G-GR and 270 to placebo with the evening meal; patients underwent a 2-week dose titration, followed by 8 weeks of stable dosing, and 1 week of dose tapering. Patients. Adults with PHN for ≥ 6 months and an average baseline Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of ≥ 4 were included in the study.

Outcome Measures

Percent change from baseline to week 10 in NPRS scores and the percentage of responders (defined as ≥ 30% reduction in NPRS scores from baseline to week 10) were determined.

Methods

Patients randomized to G-GR were categorized at each week based on their percent pain reduction up to that week, and for each category, the percentage of week 10 responders was computed. For several early-improvement criteria, the percentage of week 10 responders, odds ratios for achieving week 10 treatment response, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.

Results

There was a significant positive association between early pain reduction and week 10 treatment response. Pain reduction of < 10% at week 5 of G-GR treatment was the best early predictor of lack of endpoint response, with only 8% of these patients moving on to become week 10 treatment responders.

Conclusions

Early response was a reliable predictor of final response. This approach holds promise for aiding clinicians in decision making regarding the need for alternative or supplemental treatment during G-GR therapy for PHN.

### Gabapentin add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy [^114hh3yr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with partial seizures. In this review we summarise the current evidence regarding the antiepileptic drug gabapentin, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

Search Methods

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4. We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (14 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4, The Cochrane Library) (April 2013) and MEDLINE (1946 to 14 May 2013). We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, add-on trials of gabapentin in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Trials using an active drug control group or which compared doses of gabapentin were also included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: (a) seizure frequency and seizure freedom; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. We also undertook sensitivity best and worst-case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios for each outcome and evaluated dose-response in regression models.

Main Results

Eleven trials were included representing 2125 randomised participants. We combined data from six trials in meta-analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall risk ratio (RR) for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) shows increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to 1800 mg of gabapentin compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. Risk ratios were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06). No significant differences were found for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73). Overall the studies together are rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three-month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting, such as a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for monotherapy. Administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity as another strategy. Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Gabapentin dosing for neuropathic pain: evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^111QFifg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, and neuropathic pain is among the most common types of pain. Despite its prevalence, neuropathic pain is often underrecognized and inadequately treated. Many cases are refractory to the medications traditionally used for pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered first-line agents for neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by unwanted side effects and a risk of cardiovascular mortality.

Objectives

The goals of this article were to review data on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and to determine the optimal dosing schedule.

Methods

Randomized controlled studies of gabapentin for neuropathic pain were identified through a search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1966 to the present using the search terms gabapentin, randomized, placebo, and pain. Abstracts of identified articles were screened for study size (> 100 patients per treatment arm) and use of appropriate efficacy measures. A separate review based on information provided by the manufacturer of gabapentinaand clinical trial Web sites was conducted to ascertain whether there had been any other relevant industry- or government-sponsored trials. The manufacturer provided additional unpublshed study data.

Results

Data from 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in the review, 1 of which has not yet been published. Gabapentin was effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain syndromes. It relieved symptoms of allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperesthesia. Adverse effects were typically mild to moderate and usually subsided within approximately 10 days from the initiation of treatment. Based on available data, it appears that treatment should be started at a dose of 900 mg/d (300 mg/d on day 1, 600 mg/d on day 2, and 900 mg/d on day 3). Additional titration to 1800 mg/d is recommended for greater efficacy. Doses up to 3600 mg/d may be needed in some patients. The effective dose should be individualized according to patient response and tolerability.

Conclusion

At doses of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112ypuoq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tapering with very long-acting agents — phenobarbital protocols and evidence: Some prescribers initiate or transition patients to long-acting agents that bind more strongly to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) such as phenobarbital to initiate a BZD taper or discontinuation in patients with BZD use disorder. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate with a very long half-life (80–120 h) that results in a gradual decrease in effects after the medication is discontinued, and the CGC emphasized that this approach should be limited to situations involving imminent patient safety concerns that cannot be appropriately mitigated by an initial dose reduction. Two retrospective studies that cumulatively evaluated outcomes from over 650 patients found phenobarbital-based protocols for tapering in inpatient settings to be safe and effective; in a retrospective case series of 310 patients treated with a 3-day phenobarbital protocol, 27% experienced sedation, 17% self-discharged, none experienced falls or seizures and only 1% experienced delirium, and in a more recent chart review of 355 patients who underwent a 6-day phenobarbital protocol, no patients experienced seizures, falls, or sedation, although 5% self-discharged from treatment.

### Effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing opioid requirements after radiation in head and neck cancer in a single institution [^116bhaNb]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Gabapentin has been shown to reduce opioid use in head and neck cancer patients. Here, we examine the efficacy of prophylactic gabapentin at reducing opioid use in these patients at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients receiving radiation was performed, using patients from our previous study as controls. Risk factors for opioid use at 3 and 6months were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

In total, 53/185 patients were treated with gabapentin, 39.6% of which took opioids at 3 months vs. 58.3% in the non-gabapentin cohort (p = 0.021). Gabapentin was independently associated with less opioid use on multivariate analysis at 3 months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24–0.9). Gastrostomy tube dependence and pretreatment opioid use were associated with chronic opioid use despite gabapentin.

Conclusions

Gabapentin is effective at expediting opioid tapering in head and neck cancer patients who are not gastrostomy tube dependent or taking opioids pretreatment.

### Gabapentin withdrawal syndrome in the presence of a taper [^115LBYhP]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case report of a geriatric patient with a 5-year history of gabapentin use for enhanced bipolar control, who was tapered off of gabapentin over 1 week. The patient displayed unique withdrawal symptoms after the taper of gabapentin.

Methods

The patient is an 81-year-old white female with a life-long history of schizoaffective disorder with bipolar type I tendencies who had been prescribed gabapentin for 5 years.

Results

The patient displayed moderate upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and somatic complaints 1 day after termination of gabapentin. These symptoms gradually worsened until 10 days after, at which time she acutely developed severe mental status changes, severe somatic chest pain, and hypertension. Physical examination, electrolytes, electrocardiogram, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography were all normal. Upon reintroduction of gabapentin, the patient returned to baseline within 1–2 days.

Conclusions

Gabapentin is widely utilized currently for the chronic treatment of recalcitrant migraines, bipolar illness, pain, and epilepsy. It has a wide therapeutic index with few side effects and drug interactions, is not hepatically metabolized, and is excreted by the kidneys. Past reports have suggested that some withdrawal symptoms can present after 1–2 days upon abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin after chronic use within young to middle-aged patients. These symptoms mimic that of alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal purportedly due to a similar mechanism of action. Unique to this case is that this geriatric patient developed debilitating withdrawal symptoms after a gradual, week-long taper of gabapentin along with flu-like symptoms. It is proposed herein that a gabapentin taper should follow a course similar to that of a benzodiazepine taper — slowly and over a period of weeks to months.

### Efficacy of gabapentin for post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction: the GRACE randomized clinical trial [^113bz2f4]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The COVID-19 pandemic affected millions of people and has become a dominant etiology of olfactory dysfunction (OD). No interventions with definitive clinical utility exist. Gabapentin represents a potential therapy for COVID-19-induced OD.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of oral gabapentin on olfactory function and olfaction-related quality of life in patients with COVID-19-induced OD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pilot double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis from January 7, 2022, to February 3, 2023. Adults with at least 3 months of OD after COVID-19 infection were eligible for inclusion. Participants with a history of other causes of OD or contraindications to gabapentin were excluded.

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral gabapentin or placebo. All patients underwent titration to a maximum tolerable dose, which was maintained during an 8-week fixed-dose (FD) phase then tapered off. Participants were monitored for 4 weeks following cessation of study medication.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes were assessed following the 8-week FD phase and 4 weeks after taper completion. The primary outcome measure was the response rate determined by subjective improvement in OD on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) after the FD phase. Other subjective and objective measures of olfactory function were also assessed as secondary outcome measures.

Results

Sixty-eight participants were enrolled (34 randomized to each arm), a total of 44 participants completed the FD period and 20 (45.4%) reported response to treatment with at least slight improvement in olfaction from baseline. Of those randomized, 51 (75%) were women and 56 were White (82%) with a mean (SD) age of 43 (13.5) years. Baseline demographic features including age, sex, and race and ethnicity were not significantly different between the groups. Of the 18 participants in the gabapentin group, 8 (44%) were responders and of the 26 participants in the placebo group, 12 (46%) reported response to treatment (percent difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -31.6% to 28.2%). Mixed-model analysis of all secondary outcome measures demonstrated no clinically meaningful or statistically significant difference between the gabapentin and placebo groups throughout the trial. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, gabapentin was not associated with statistically significant or clinically meaningful benefit over placebo and likely is not an efficacious therapy for COVID-19-induced OD.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1163PgG2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1146a48U]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin appropriate for monotherapy. Providing at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate, and if the risk is unknown patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication.

### Gabapentin add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^116Myt2S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2013. Most people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of gabapentin, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, 20 March 2018), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 March 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 March 2018) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 20 March 2018). We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, add-on trials of gabapentin in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We also included trials using an active drug control group or comparing different doses of gabapentin.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal (any reason) and adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. We also undertook sensitivity best-case and worst-case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome and evaluated dose-response in regression models.

Main Results

We included 12 trials representing 2607 randomised participants. We combined data from six trials in meta-analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall RR for reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) showed increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to gabapentin 1800 mg compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. RRs were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11; 3 studies, 787 participants; low-quality evidence), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82; 5 studies, 1161 participants; low-quality evidence) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant differences for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73; 4 trials, 1034 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Overall, the studies were rated at low to unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available. We judged the overall quality of evidence (using the GRADE approach) as low to moderate due to potential attrition bias resulting from missing outcome data and imprecise results with wide confidence intervals.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three-month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Gabapentin is not a scheduled drug.

9.2 Abuse

Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opiate (mu, delta or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. A small number of postmarketing cases report gabapentin misuse and abuse. These individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of poly-substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances. When prescribing gabapentin carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g. development of tolerance, self-dose escalation, and drug-seeking behavior).

9.3 Dependence

There are rare postmarketing reports of individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms shortly after discontinuing higher than recommended doses of gabapentin used to treat illnesses for which the drug is not approved. Such symptoms included agitation, disorientation and confusion after suddenly discontinuing gabapentin that resolved after restarting gabapentin. Most of these individuals had a history of poly-substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances. The dependence and abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1113W8sF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as an alternative option. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^112SvJsx]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pregabalin is recommended as a treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions,–where it is advised that it be carefully escalated to the optimal dose. In the USA, the maximum approved dose of pregabalin is 300 mg/day for DPN and 600 mg/day for PHN, while in Europe it is 600 mg/day for all neuropathic pain. Despite this, many patients may not receive the most effective dose of pregabalin, with a recent drug utilization study in the UK indicating that the approximate median prescribed dose of pregabalin for neuropathic pain was only 150 mg/day. This analysis provides evidence that new patients will tend to respond with every increase in pregabalin dose.

Neuropathic pain can be challenging to treat effectively. While there are a number of treatment options, not all are effective in all patients. For instance, data on the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with lower back pain are inconsistent. In a randomized withdrawal trial, pregabalin was not shown to be effective in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy. Even for those conditions where its efficacy is well established, many patients will not respond to treatment with pregabalin. As physicians are advised to ensure that effective and tolerable treatment for neuropathic pain is initiated as soon as possible, it is important to ascertain quickly if a treatment is ineffective so that other options can be tested. In these circumstances, it may be understandable why the time is not taken to escalate some patients to a higher, efficacious dose of pregabalin. However, of the 701 patients in this analysis who took the 150 mg/day dosing, 136 (19.4%) responded at that dose. Of those who continued to higher doses, 231 (33.0%) responded at a higher dose. These data do not correct for the tendency for higher doses to be used when patients have inadequate response at a lower dose. The MSM analyses make some correction for this tendency in dose escalation and indicate that it can be worthwhile to persist with pregabalin until the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects is utilized.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^114CeTCR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Gabapentin regulatory and patient considerations note that several states consider gabapentin a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule V drug with stricter regulations and some inclusion in prescription drug monitoring programs, and cases of gabapentin abuse, dependence, and withdrawal have been documented with abuse and dependence considered to be at higher risk in patients with preexisting alcohol or drug abuse history. The patient focus group noted a high pill burden because gabapentin is usually dosed three times per day, and gabapentin might be a reasonable treatment option for patients with comorbidities for which there are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications and off-label uses. Some concern about weight gain exists, and some military duties (most notably flight) could be limited by more common adverse events and should be carefully considered when prescribing this medication.

### Prescribing patterns and off-label use of gabapentinoid agents at dhulikhel hospital, Nepal: a cross-sectional study [^117WLXtb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The evidence on the safety and efficacy of gabapentinoids for off-label uses, such as perioperative care, musculoskeletal pain management, and neurological disorders, ranges from conflicting to significant. Gabapentinoids demonstrate only modest effectiveness in managing perioperative pain, and their role in treating spinal stenosis remains unclear. However, they are beneficial in multimodal pain management, as they improve pain relief and reduce opioid use in surgical settings. Given the lack of compelling evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of gabapentinoids for both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions, it is important to exercise caution when prescribing and utilizing these drugs.

The recommended doses for neuropathic pain are 1200–3600 mg/day for gabapentin, starting at 300 mg/day, and 300–600 mg/day for pregabalin, starting at 150 mg/day. These doses are gradually increased based on the patient's response. International guidelines indicate that gabapentin and pregabalin are either minimally effective or ineffective at doses below the recommended levels for neuropathic pain. Pregabalin was predominantly found to be prescribed at an initiating dose generally considered to be sub-therapeutic (75 mg once daily) for neuropathic pain. This variability may be attributed to the symptomatic nature of the indications and the lower risk of abuse and potential side effects for the general Nepalese population at sub-standard dosing. The dosage requirements for gabapentinoids have been found to differ across populations and conditions. The frequent prescription of low-dose pregabalin for neuropathic pain raises the possibility that it may be used for night-time sedation rather than for pain management, indicating the need for further investigation.

Pregabalin was often prescribed with methylcobalamin to potentially enhance its analgesic effects for neuropathic pain. Studies in India have shown that pregabalin is frequently initiated at sub-therapeutic doses, which are gradually increased as needed to improve patient tolerance. Additionally, pregabalin is often used in combination with methylcobalamin to enhance its synergistic effects and improve patient adherence. However, this combined use lacks support from national and international guidelines. A study conducted in Germany showed a moderate prevalence of pregabalin dependency. In our study, two patients on a pregabalin regimen were diagnosed with dependency. For those patients, pregabalin discontinuation was planned with a gradual tapering strategy. This approach aimed to prevent withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, anxiety, and hyperhidrosis, which can arise from abrupt discontinuation, particularly after long-term use.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117ScwSw]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) are supported by very low quality evidence and a neutral stance; evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Pregabalin is a controlled substance with the potential for abuse and dependence, while gabapentin is not federally scheduled but some states have scheduled it due to addiction and dependence concerns. One study indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of opioid-related mortality and respiratory depression. Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been used off-label for these indications. The potential harms of adverse events (AEs), including medication abuse and dependence, slightly outweighed the benefits versus placebo.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111GCekE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — ambulatory risk management and pharmacotherapy options emphasizes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy as soon as possible, with benzodiazepines recommended as first-line treatment; phenobarbital can be used as an alternative in Level 2-WM settings for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use but should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use. For patients at high risk of severe withdrawal, front loading with a benzodiazepine is recommended and patients should be closely observed for over-sedation and respiratory depression following administration. For lower-risk patients, providing at least a single or a few doses of benzodiazepine is appropriate, including when there is a history of severe or complicated withdrawal, risk for complications of significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric illness (particularly cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease), or signs/symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content. Risk stratification includes timing within the 6–36 hour window after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption; if risk is unknown, patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours. For those at risk of developing mild or moderate withdrawal, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate options.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^115Sfkbv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Pregabalin is given orally with or without food.

When discontinuing pregabalin, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Adults

The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Although pregabalin was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia in Adults

The recommended dose of pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115hdkrZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1126ue8t]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Nervous system toxicities — Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) under immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy is managed as follows: All grades warrant workup and intervention given potential for progressive GBS to lead to respiratory compromise, and there is no G1 toxicity. For symptomatic grades, discontinue ICPi, obtain neurology consultation, and arrange admission to inpatient unit with capability of rapid transfer to ICU-level monitoring. Start IVIG (0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days for a total dose of 2 g/kg) or plasmapheresis, and note that plasmapheresis immediately after IVIG will remove immunoglobulin. Corticosteroids are usually not recommended for idiopathic GBS; however, in ICPi-related forms, a trial is reasonable (methylprednisolone 2–4 mg/kg/d), followed by slow steroid taper; for G3–4, pulse steroid dosing (methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days) may also be considered along with IVIG or plasmapheresis, and after pulse steroids, taper steroids over 4–6 weeks. Supportive care includes frequent neuro checks and pulmonary function monitoring, monitoring for concurrent autonomic dysfunction, nonopioid management of neuropathic pain such as pregabalin, gabapentin, or duloxetine, and treatment of constipation/ileus; extreme caution with rechallenging is advised for severe cases after complete resolution of symptoms and tapered off immunosuppression.

### Gabapentin dosing in the treatment of epilepsy [^112RcHUo]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is considered a safe and well-tolerated antipileptic drug (AED) with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and a broad therapeutic index. However, recent studies have used higher doses and faster titration schedules than those used in the pivotal trials that established the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures.

Objective

The purposes of this review were to assess the gabapentin titration and dosing regimens that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, to develop dosing recommendations to maximize antiseizure efficacy without compromising tolerability, and to formulate guidelines for an adequate therapeutic assessment of gabapentin dosage efficacy.

Methods

In the absence of sufficient placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, a formal evidence-based assessment could not be performed. However, a MEDLINE search using the search terms gabapentin and epilepsy, spanning back to the year 1986, produced numerous published reports from randomized, placebo-controlled and open-label trials, as well as case reports. These were reviewed to assess the range of dosing and titration schedules reported. Reports that employed gabapentin doses and titration schedules were selected for review.

Results

Our review of this literature suggests improved seizure control at higher gabapentin maintenance dosages (≤ 3600 mg/d) than are used today in clinical practice (1800 mg/d) without an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions. Most of the patients who received high dosages (eg, 3600 mg/d) or experienced fast titration rates tolerated gabapentin well. Side effects occurred around the onset of dosing and were reported in some studies to be transient.

Conclusions

Based in the literature here, in most adult patients, gabapentin may be initiated at a dosage of 900 mg/d and titrated to maintenance dosages ≥ 3600 mg/d. Children may be treated with gabapentin 23 to 78 mg/kg per day. Based on controlled and open trials, the majority of patients will tolerate gabapentin well enough for an adequate therapeutic assessment. Titration to effect can be accomplished rapidly, if necessary; however, as with other AEDs, optimal seizure control may take months to achieve.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1145zm9j]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 4 — Management of postoperative pain in patients receiving long-term opioid therapy — Key elements include conducting a preoperative evaluation to determine preoperative opioid use and doses, providing education regarding use of opioids before surgery, and recognizing that postoperative opioid requirements will typically be greater and that pain might be more difficult to control. The table advises to consider pain specialty consultation (and in some cases behavioral and/or addiction consultation) for pain that is difficult to manage and complex cases; consider nonpharmacological interventions such as Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and Cognitive–behavioral therapies; and consider nonopioid systemic medications including Gabapentin or pregabalin and Ketamine. It also advises to consider local anesthetic-based peripheral regional and neuraxial local analgesic techniques; consider PCA with basal infusion of opioids for difficult to manage pain with appropriate monitoring; and provide education and instructions on tapering opioids to target dose after discharge.

Benzodiazepine tapering — managing mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms — "Most patients (but not all) will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper". When symptoms are challenging, "the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10". If those measures are unsuccessful, "clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions".

Decompensated cirrhosis — pain management options include nonpharmacological strategies such as "Hot/cold", "Physical therapy", "Mindfulness/meditation", other behavioral therapies, and "Acupuncture (caution if platelets ≤ 50,000)", along with topical agents ("Lidocaine patches", "Capsaicin cream or patch", and "Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., diclofenac sodium 1% gel)"). Systemic options and starting doses include "APAP 500 mg q6h for a maximum of 2 g/d" and "Gabapentin 300 mg daily (starting dose) or pregabalin 50 mg b.i.d. (starting dose) (for neuropathic pain)", with the footnote "Renal dosing adjustments needed; cannot be stopped without tapering; can cause nausea, sedation, and ataxia". Opioid starts listed include "Fentanyl patch 12-μg starting dose (typically not recommended as the initial agent; avoid in patients with sarcopenia/cachexia or fever)" and "Oxycodone 2.5-mg p.o. q6–8h prn starting dose", and once comfort is the priority, "opioid medications should be titrated to meet the patient's needs without concerns for longer term impacts".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Pregablin [^111G96FV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Pregabalin capsules is given orally with or without food.

When discontinuing pregabalin capsules, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Because pregabalin capsules is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Adults

The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin capsules are 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Although pregabalin capsules were also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia in Adults

The recommended dose of pregabalin capsules are 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min.

Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate pregabalin capsules, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### FDA identifies sudden discontinuation of opioid pain… [^1141hok1]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Health care professionals should not abruptly discontinue opioids in a patient who is physically dependent. When you and your patient have agreed to taper the dose of opioid analgesic, consider a variety of factors, including the dose of the drug, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. No standard opioid tapering schedule exists that is suitable for all patients. Create a patient-specific plan to gradually taper the dose of the opioid and ensure ongoing monitoring and support, as needed, to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms, worsening of the patient's pain, or psychological distress.
- To help FDA track safety issues with medicines, report side effects from opioids or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of this page.
- Do not abruptly discontinue opioid analgesics in patients physically dependent on opioids. Counsel patients not to discontinue their opioids without first discussing the need for a gradual tapering regimen.
- There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. A patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose of the opioid gradually.
- In general, for patients who are physically dependent on opioids, taper by an increment of no more than 10 percent to 25 percent every 2 to 4 weeks. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper.
- If the patient is experiencing increased pain or serious withdrawal symptoms, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time, raise the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then once stable, proceed with a more gradual taper.
- When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support, is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic.
- Patients who have been taking opioids for shorter time periods may tolerate a more rapid taper.
- Frequent follow-up with patients is important. Reassess the patient regularly to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms that emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include:

- Restlessness
- Lacrimation
- Rhinorrhea
- Yawning.

### Gabapentin (Gabarone) [^111t4F7o]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Gabapentin is not a scheduled drug.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed.

Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opioid (mu, delta or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. Gabapentin misuse and abuse have been reported in the postmarketing setting and published literature. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of polysubstance abuse. Some of these individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. When prescribing GABARONE, carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g., self-dose escalation and drug-seeking behavior). The abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

9.3 Dependence

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. There are rare postmarketing reports of individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms shortly after discontinuing higher than recommended doses of gabapentin used to treat illnesses for which the drug is not approved. Such symptoms included agitation, disorientation and confusion after suddenly discontinuing gabapentin that resolved after restarting gabapentin. The dependence potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

### Dose-related beneficial and harmful effects of gabapentin in postoperative pain management-post hoc analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^114Lr3jf]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

During the last 15 years, gabapentin has become an established component of postoperative pain treatment. Gabapentin has been employed in a wide range of doses, but little is known about the optimal dose, providing the best balance between benefit and harm. This systematic review with meta-analyses aimed to explore the beneficial and harmful effects of various doses of gabapentin administered to surgical patients.

Materials and Methods

Data in this paper were derived from an original review, and the subgroup analyses were predefined in an International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews published protocol: PROSPERO (ID: CRD42013006538). The methods followed Cochrane guidelines. The Cochrane Library's CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Google Scholar, and FDA database were searched for relevant trials. Randomized clinical trials comparing gabapentin versus placebo were included. Four different dose intervals were investigated: 0–350, 351–700, 701–1050, and > 1050 mg. Primary co-outcomes were 24-hour morphine consumption and serious adverse events (SAEs), with emphasis put on trials with low risk of bias.

Results

One hundred and twenty-two randomized clinical trials, with 8466 patients, were included. Sixteen were overall low risk of bias. No consistent increase in morphine-sparing effect was observed with increasing doses of gabapentin from the trials with low risk of bias. Analyzing all trials, the smallest and the highest dose subgroups demonstrated numerically the most prominent reduction in morphine consumption. Twenty-seven trials reported 72 SAEs, of which 83% were reported in the > 1050 mg subgroup. No systematic increase in SAEs was observed with increasing doses of gabapentin.

Conclusion

Data were sparse, and the small number of trials with low risk of bias is a major limitation for firm conclusions. Taking these limitations into account, we were not able to demonstrate a clear relationship between the dosage of gabapentin and opioid-sparing or harmful effects. These subgroup analyses are exploratory and hypothesis-generating for future trialists.
